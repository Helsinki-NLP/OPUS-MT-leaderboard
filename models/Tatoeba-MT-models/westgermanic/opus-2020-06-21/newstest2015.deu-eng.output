Repeal to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The Congress-based Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as a citizen's right.
"So as trade unions die, also die the middle classjobs," said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota, and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in the Congress.
I therefore proudly propose, together with the civil law symbols John Lewis, the Staff Authorisation Law.
This train-breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in discrimination because of organisation of trade unions such as other forms of discrimination, and thus stops active forces.
The supplement of the national law on labour law to create a possibility for discrimination-based workers to organise a trade union representative in order to complain before a civil court for justice - and to obtain damage or criminal money - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the further sponsors of their lawsheet suggest the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the returnes to which the unions had been suspended over the past years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries around the country -, Americans once in the world have encouraged to recognise, extend and maintain labour rights.
There was a time for millions of Americans to remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of pression and the right of association in an breathtaking.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Munro Mac Arthur and his stake encouraged the country to approve a constitution that should ensure that the military autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions took part in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of the workers are guaranteed for association and common trade and trade."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his stake forced the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Fascism Adolf Hitlers would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers should organize, and their voice in the new nation, Germans inserted a clause explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations to ensure and improve the working and economic conditions will guarantee each individual and any occupation or industry.
Agreements restricting or aiming to smuggling it are zero and neglig; in this respect, inconstraint measures are unlawful.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt has been the chairman of the International Human Rights Commission, which was designed by the General Declaration of Human Rights, as it was accepted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect his interests."
Since generations, Americans have accepted the basic prizes that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union - and that this union should then be protected in collective negotiations as a equivalent partner with companies and government authorities.
After these rights in America under the committee, it is very wise to re-examine the American ideal, according to the working population must have the right to unite and belong to a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said for fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now all know that the labor movement did not limit the strength of the nation but increased it.
As a result of increasing the living standards of millions of people, work has in a wonderful way created a market for industry and increased the entire nation to unpredictable production level.
Those who attack the work forgot these simple truths, but the story preserves it.
History remembers, and we should do that too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights, and the enlargement of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representatives, is long overlapping.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have raised America in the past and embrace the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporarily law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force for closure
On Sunday, a U.S. director temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, from the lawyer said that it would probably have led to the closing of all five abortion clinics of the State.
This measure, which was raised by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June and should enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient recording right at a hospital within a 30 miles radius in order to acquire their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that the doctors will continue to continue to take legal abortions while applying such a right.
"The applicants can continue to work legally while seeking to gain these rights," wrote Bundesrichter John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing for the Judge will be held to make a more persistent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision that the latest were in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors wished more time to obtain hospital instruction rights.
"The today's decision means that women in Louisiana dismiss a deterioration law that wants to take them their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President and chairman of the Center of Reproduction Rights, who had complained in the name of three of the five government clinics to keep up the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics not connected to the complaint and also requested instruction rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 countries which have adopted similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for non-constitutional.
Key posts of a law in Texas, which had forced most of the clinics left in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocater and the American College of Eastretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that indication rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Abortion entrepreneur considers that measures serve the protection of women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of clinics closing.
Only a doctor who conducts abortions in Louisiana has patients' right to instructions, the centre of reproduction rights shared.
If all other doctors in the state are forced not to perform abortions anymore, this doctor would not perform the operation anymore because of fear of its security, the group said.
In their argumentation against the judgment, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors because of the implementation of abortions, while their requests to indication rights were still addressed.
Suspension of diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment opportunities lead to higher death rates by eggstock cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have set a video hotel online for her mother who died in 2007 on eggstock cancer.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying on egg livestock cancer than on women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians in which eggstock cancer was detected in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive after the diagnosis.
The research leader Susan Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
KLINE STUDY: New medicines could slow down lungs and egg livestock cancers
The researchers studied women’s medical care over seven years.
Dr Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, the type of egg livestock cancer, existing precautions and social and economic status also affected survival events.
For older women and those whose cancer had been further advanced to the diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than those in urban areas.
Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city died with higher probability of egg liver cancers, Dr. Jordan suggests a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological uncologens, and they are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedical services in order to counteract the distances, she proposed as possible a strengthening of the service of inflamed doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer in their homeplace, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr Jordan said that the study, independent of the geographical status, showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in the egg livestock cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and precautional strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013 Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of eggstock cancer.
Garden centres regret the payments of household owners
The decline together with a stronger decrease in the number of household owners under 35 years could result in a loss of tens of thousands of pounds per year when today's young consumers reported by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, the "Kernalters Group for Garden Products".
The report states that tenants are spending an average of 55 percent of the amount that spends people with their own homes for their garden.
The increase in people living in high urbanised areas without gardens, asphalting popular methods, pregnancy for parking purposes and the sinking garden size are further factors threatening the sectors in which estimated 5 billion dollars are annually implemented in sale.
The minimum expenditure for garden products per household is mentioned in the Great London area, where over a period of 6 years the share of households has fallen from 61 to 43 per cent.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, Chief garden consultant for the RHS said, "containing gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants at a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "gold age" of the garden single trade due to increasing home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also prognosted a improved market situation for this year because of better weather according to unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement conducted by Imran Khan and the spiritual Tahirul Qadri is going on in Pakistan.
In the capital of Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators stimulated the state television broadcast PTV.
Information Minister Pervaizkkah said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters again from PTV buildings.
The sender set up his operation for about 40 minutes, but now sends it back.
At the same time, around 3000 demons tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometer away, they delivered themselves with stokes and stones equipped collapses with security forces.
The police took tear gas.
The demons asked Sharif's return, but this refused.
The army of the country therefore calls for a political solution to the conflict to "use without time and apply without violence".
After a meeting in the main quarters on Sunday evening, the military told: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already begun more frequently.
The opposition policy Imran Khan introduces Prime Minister Sharif to have deceived last year at the parliamentary election in May.
The tests were escalated during the weekend after Khan and Qadri called their followers to prevent Sharif's Residenz.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat for spionage reports
The Turkish Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the most servant US diplomats of the country to inform a report on American and British spionage in Turkey.
Vice-President Bülnt said that the business leader of the US budget and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine The mirror as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, shows that Turkey was a main area of activity for the US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan played the importance of the report and said that all important countries were pioneering each other.
An earlier report that also had the most important secret service of Germany in the visa provided significantly worse responses from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Trainer threatens with consequences for pendler
The band-wide warning strike of the Lokführer on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The state announced for 18 to 21 a.m. all transport companies, including the remote, regional and S-Bahn transportation;
The main distortion of the warning strike is freight transport.

said the district chairman of the German Lokomotivführer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant accidents.
Regional priorities are not available.
The main distortion of the warning strike is freight transport.
The German railway in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to scatter, so that it is difficult to predict the consequences.
Police Chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence for depression by police and staff of the city of Calvià to the office of Mallorca.
The head of the Calvià Police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption of businesses and bar owners in the famous Binge-Drinking-Hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was taken into investigation by several people from Punta Ballena, the street in which most bars and night clubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online day newspaper Mallorca Diario, the accusers presented the office of the prosecutor for corruption fighting Mallorcas on Friday evidence of depression by policemen and employees of the city Calvià.
Two other local politicians were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption preliminary preliminary rulings and are consulted by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish newspaper ABC reported that the intimidated night club owners said that the authorities' veterinary economy have serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about money, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Leave our basic life from the game.
We don't have anything to lose.
In this summer, Magaluf made international strokes due to a viral YouTube video, in which a 18-year-old British tourist was shown to be full of 24 men during a suspension of Fell ratio.
On the other hand, the island authorities have attempted to stop the illegal behavior of alcoholized vacations in magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the renowned alcohol-consumer tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour Organizer Carnage must pay together a sentence of 5,000 € (73,000 $).
The town of Magaluf, mostly popular with young British holidays, is also known for some accidents under alcoholic influence, including the trend of "Balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from the Adelaide airport
The FRÜHLING has made South Australia a winter surprise, with strong showers and strong wind that affected flights from the Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 21.5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already been down the night to Sunday.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy viewers, including a giant that started shortly 20 p.m. and provided almost 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter had been cared for an early dose of spring last week, temperatures in the city fell to a maximum of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The humid weather conditions probably have led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed just after 19.30 p.m. but was taken by a wind wind - a sudden change of wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start.
Windstrading reached about 50 km/h on the ground on the Adelaide airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to start on a second airport and finally set up at about 20 p.m.
The delay of flights led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirate flight from Dubai and a Quanta flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 15°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible viewers.
Matthies meant: Maximum time for large networks
In view of the galopping technical progress that threatens our home to transform in high-tech school centres, our Columnist Bernd Matthies comforts with an extremely familiar electronic accessories.
While I write this here, my glance falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But there'd be an idea: If the cable was not, all hearers would flee around in the house in a short time, and that would still be more retro.
Similarly, is it true of the ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, Tippfehlers: electronic) sector the rule that the world's newness is today the electric screw of tomorrow, purchased - obsolete.
And, for example, who still has a rumor TV in the living room today says simply that he rejects television in principle.
Why are these thoughts?
Because the stimulating of Ifa at the radio tower this week brings us back our absolute incompetence in electronic questions.
The Laie, who has been blindly dominated by earlier washing machine and CD players, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread with unfassable eitlem expert talk before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologys" promises us.
Yeah, are you still?
What should we talk to people who are apparently voluntary to such quark?
In principle, for some 20 years, it is important for us to connect our house randomly.
In order to comply with the yogurt itself, so that the brand reporter tells us in vacation on the Maldives that it burns grade in the work room.
And wouldn't it wonderful if we were from the office of air conditioning on our soon arrival ...?
Yes, it requires an air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly be true at the moment: We have our armband clock, say, "Sauge!" - and home, the vacuum soarboat runs off.
Irre.
Everything goes on nothing more than a revolution: "Switching the limits between white and brown goods," raantly a industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the vapour sends the weather report and the databrille shows how long the pizza still needs in the oven, which does not use anything because we are standing in the stake.
We also know from the daily practice: If a new-modical device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed empty.
What another reason is that the spiral cable will survive on the phone also the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after they had spent the summer in air protection spaces, while rocket and killers' committee went back to their municipalities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and closed the schools in Gaza, while the territory took up from the battles.
The start of school brought a feeling of joy and expectation to the congregations drawn by missiles in the south of Israel, but the signs of the fight are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" children's garden, which were hit by a rocket before meeting the students of the Granat splitter from the walls and rail walls.
"We have some fear, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in the Kibbutz Saad and English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a little funny" to suddenly go back to school.
"They were difficult times, and we haven't gone out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near Gaza border to provide its support.
Until the war last week, thousands of people of the border congregations were interrupted, such as seeds, or left their houses to move away from Gaza to escape the rocket and killer fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality near Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian killer granate, still hesitates with the return.
The Ministry of Education said that a dozen families have not yet returned.
Her children were provisionally in other schools.
Premierminister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot, a border city to Gaza, which is hardly drawn by the Palestinian Board.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will ensure that you acquire knowledge and provide you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on a permanent army suspension last Tuesday.
The arms rush provided an immediate end of the fight; however, important problems remain unsolved, as the Hamas demand after a withdrawal of the Israeli Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopening the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for a disarmament of the Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two in the fights killed Israeli soldiers.
A new round of indirect discussions will probably begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them were civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
However, Israel contradicted these information and estimated that at least half of the killers were fighters, no concrete evidence for this information was presented.
On Israeli side 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai workers, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4.591 rockets and killers during the fight on Israeli cities, most in the southern part of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people searched for more than 100 UN school refugees renovated into provisional protection rooms.
During tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protective areas and continue fighting, the educational authorities last week moved the beginning of the school year.
"I hope the school is soon open again, so that we can continue to learn how the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl asks NPD ban procedures
In view of the loss of the NPD in Sachsen, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl expressed himself for an end to the current NPD ban procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the current prohibition procedures against the NPD should be an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts worse off than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU country rif in Baden-Württemberg, the "declarated Volkszeitung".
This is a delightful development in the right direction and a development that gives me more the result that the NPD is politically fighting and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD was very briefly failed during the Sunday vote at the Five-Procent-Hürde.
A first approach to a prohibition of the legal exrematory party was failed in 2003 because Constitutional Protection was at the time also in the NPD tip informants.
In December 2013, after long preparation, the Federal Council entered a new application in Karlsruhe.
Bundesregierung and Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tent for new refugees
The new countries are now located in tents.
The central first intake for refugees in Harburg is from all nuts.
Now the inside authority has made up three tents of the Red Cross.
District politicians were not informed before - they are little excited.
"These hauruck actions have further prevention of citizens and do not allow the district politicians to participate constructively in the human submission of refugees," says some Britta Herrmann, group chairman of the Greens at the Harburg District Assembly.
Their party demands that Harburg District Management is currently providing unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be placed in the three tents.
Reasoning reasons in the first receipt are the storm of help seekers, and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, shows a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Homes in Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, so the RP data from Monday.
Due to this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10,9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not equally spread across the country.
The research leader of RP Data, Tim Lawless, told Sydney and Melbourne to drive a two-shared market.
The figures of RP Data indicate that the household prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, in Melbourne, by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increased by an average of five and six percent.
On the other end of the scale Canberra, which was hard hit by the cuts in state expenditure and where prices increased only by 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless continued that the beginning of the spring would now be a rise in the property for sale that would undermine the market "a real test".
"If you consider the lasting high rate of the auction prices, a generally rapid sales rate and the lasting low interest environment, it is likely that the private home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts statements by the Managing Director Peer Medau and tests this to post as a field ruler.
The style of the university is not this, says in the communication.
The Medau family was thus already informed in the middle of June about the intention of the university.
The statement that the plans were first known in July is definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans are not "predictions or even decisions", but it would be "preferential".
The development of the narrow road to the castle is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
Of a nine meters wide street, it is not the speech.
It goes to current stand around 5,50 meters, that's a metre wider than before," Pötzl explains.
The argument of Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking areas in the future will only be used by students of the university, Pötzl does not want to apply.
Zugeparkt is not at all because, as with other public parkings, this can now be intelligently solved.
Think to the residents
The kidnapping mountain weight, which would be located on the grounds and which would lead along the way to the parking roof, is "not affected" according to the college president.
Rather, he thinks he's not only about the kidnapping, but also about the residents' institution to the Friedrich Streib street and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
So there is much more than participating interests of Mr Medau," says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parent's group of children, with the expansion of the street, would be entitled to "may lose a few natural spots of Coburg", "can the reader itself decide".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Bauamt Bamberg, wants to inform the citylords about the construction of the university until 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new conclusion".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's group about the school plans last week.
Therefore, the access for the new parking area is not intended to lead over the campus and the Friedrich-Streib street, but over the Medau-Berg.
This means that the narrow street should be built two-spurely to about a kilometer long length.
According to high accounts of the Medaus, traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would simplify them.
From about 2000 vehicles every day the talk is.
From the side of the city you didn't want to talk to the project until now.
Glandorf returns from Handball National Team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old by the Bundesligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt led to health problems especially for this decision.
The decision was not easy to please me, it has been matured for several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to finish my career in the national team," said the World Championshipr of 2007 on his Facebook page.
It is therefore going to the international rest with a balance of 167 countries and 576 gates for Germany.
Because the whisperous retreat player for the Champions-League winner from Flensburg still wants to go on Torejagd for a few years, he is no longer available to the new German trainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelandic, who announced its border for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf led to a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have excited me as well as my long - old competitors and my followers will be excited.
But I would like to be healthy for my club in the next few years, but there are longer regeneration breaks that do not allow the current double load.
The left hands had to fear his career even after a remote infection in 2012.
Because of Achillessehnen problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball covenant (DHB) with a cortison pipe that later had caused strong inflammation.
A emergency operation and two other attacks followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor, the conflict ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career goes to no body spurlessly passing.
I have some healthy construction sites that I can't ignore.
After the three infection-related foot operations that took place in 2012 in short distances, I never got my blood pressure correctly in the handle.
There are some other disadvantaged complaints to this.
At the beginning of the year, I have noticed that although I control my head, my body cannot deceive," said Glandorf in the interview to the journal "Handball Time".
For a comeback he would only be ready in the absolute emergency case.
"When all the tricks are breaking, I'm always prepared," said the two-fold family father to the special magazine.
However, I can count the years I can play the ball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have become quite humble as far as my health is concerned.
After my career I want to be able to go somewhat just.
In addition to the 2007 WM title and the winner of the Champions League in 2014, he took the EHF pocal in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the Pokal Sieger's European pocal.
German economy smuggled by 0.2% in spring
The crises around the globe have breached the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the prequartal.
This was part of the Statistical Federal Office and thus confirmed provisional calculations.
In spring, the economy was only in the consumption, while investments fell down.
Foreign trade also breached the conjuncture.
Thanks to the strong annual task for the first half of the year, a GDP total of 0.8 per cent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Moodste", which first led by the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The Burgmann City of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer".
The largest cycling association of the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
It is the largest bicycle tour cross through Münsterland, the bicycle paradies near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked with their registration at Jos ter Huerne for the organization of this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered in various special journals.
We come from Den Helder and have driven overnight to participate in this tour.
We want to get to know the Münsterland also closer to this type," the cyclists enjoyed the route through the circles Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the Associationheim of the Schützebruderschaft Sta.
Catherine went on a small "frequency journey" through the city over the wall, where the start was also done.
The route, which was written for three different categories, led to men's wood over the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and through Haixbeck and Picturebeck back to Horstmar.
At 95 kilometres with 1175 meters, 120 kilometers by 1475 meters and 145 kilometers by 1775 meters, the cyclists proved its good condition.
They were planted on the way in Haïxbeck and imagebeck.
The main organizer Jos at Huerne and Mayor's representative Heinz Lölfing showed great joy about the success of this bicycle sport events.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful experience for all parties.
The organization dismissed without problems and there were no negative incidents," moved Heinz Lölfing a positive facilitation of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants, as the organizer had hoped, what was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We see us again in 2015 at hopefully beautiful weather on 30 August or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to come back to Münsterland, and the organizers plan to resett.
Constantine Weckers kind of honest memories
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songmaker, pazifist, political activist, ex-Häftling, brought into "Mönch and warriors" on 287 pages.
Not chronological, but more thoughts for thought fetzes, the Munich born on June 1, 1947, each chapter initiated by an appropriate song.
And he is unusual in this regard: from the Onanie as a gymnasiast to the store Diebstahl and drug consumption he does not leave human weaknesses.
Also, to show up how he himself learned tolerance in handling his fellow humans.
Widths of space also take abstract, but about the important terms: Love, soul, ego, His Spirituality - all of this he is trying to go in the ground, in a very philosophy, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pazifism, his societal criticism, his political engagement - and also, as not only the music characterized him (the opera lover became the Soul and Rock musician), but also his prisoner.
Finally, the Lebemann Constantin Wecker has also approached the Ascetic Monument, which created "by subtracting", as he says, "in order to leave everything unnecessary".
There are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the highly spiritual views: such as slandering in a local or a waist-switching car travel where he frontally fished a tree.
There he is unusual honesty.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into the arm.
Didn't say "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of jamaic immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, who is partly based on a imaginary conversation with his father and created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of rhml and rap, with live melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood feelings.
He visited "great" therapy after his mother's death, and Henry is thought about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
Never saw his face, just heard his voice, "Hear up with the garbage.
Leave your sister alone.
Move you!
I want to look at Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown up when I was a child - went with him and talked about things like the form of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket hit.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A large part of my life was this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper.
Suddenly Henry opened a vegetation in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at his father’s times, he won a look at how life was like him.
It's a little lighter now, but they're dark, betrayed, deep stygic labyrinthe with flames and smoke and a lot of noise.
My father used to put himself in the wake and then they could slowly hear him how he began singing because he could wash the gambling of himself.
When I stayed around there, I realized that he had done the years to bring food to the table, and my respect for him became greater.
Still, Henry grew up as a child without his parents’ testimony.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother was bad at the end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Due to his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop embarking me!
Daddy, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It's still kind of French, with whom he was married 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "You must be radical.
So I went through this fitnessding and also had to make a drastic diet to convert the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exciting.
No one likes Karotten.
Henry's career change may be shown in his elegant, short-cuted bart.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he is associated by the theatre.
It followed the comödie of the mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is another experience than the Sitcoms and comödies that have filled its business life.
He started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the seventies. "I was the only black imitator/comedian in television for a quite long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had to grow up not only before the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient widow specimen machine, while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people painted "swiftly," Henry opened his comedy there for five years.
My family was very unfortunate.
I wanted somehow that it had never happened, but I don't repent that I did.
It was an unusual, unusual position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years-long prize-craned light pillar of British television" was also a "great parody black people."
By introducing figures that spotted the British black culture both as feathered, Henry worked on an alternative Comedy circle in the eighties.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went on in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as the chef of the kitchen Gareth Blacklock in the Comedy series Chef!
Advertisement, documentary films, TV series and film roles pretend his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought: "What are you doing as next, Len, because it feels like it's just like you're just bringing the time around or you'll get a little on the spot."
Then a documentary for Radio 4 came with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first result turned around Shakespeare.
I was very allergic on Shakespeare.
I had never learned anything about him at school and mainly thought him for a domain of middle class, white in strumpfhosen and a coal head in front.
So I was afraid of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few of the words into the mouth, and then you'll understand why we love all Shakespeare.
Henry produced 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was excited.
I felt that I could do this.
It was almost like someone finally put up my head.
"There is, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, search a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he entered up in the comedy of the mistakes.
Suddenly, I was at the national theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinktive that he had to talk to the audience.
"A little voice told me "You have to bridge 10 minutes now while she repaired the computer."
Instead, the stage leader stated that the idea continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from the stage and anything in me said "Oh, God is thanks."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave someone else.
"You play in a play of theatre, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panik is very good, that strengthens the tens.
It also came well, so it is like a great sign of gods who tell me "This is your determination."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERNID voice.
So I'm staying on it.
I really love it.
I love being in a sample room.
Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is passing through humorous outbreaks, while he always imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up-comedy because I find that this kind of immediately satisfaction is somewhat dangerous by a room full of foreigners.
If you're always looking for this, you're going on a wall.
I sometimes get up in the Apollo if I like to do this, but I don't have so much as before.
I'll ask him if he's ever going to make a stand-up tour.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form an beginning, a central part and the end of a trip - I don't think I want to give it ever again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I'd like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Jemens capital
In the conflict between the Chithi republics and the Jemenite government, Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi followers would have occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a speaker of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
There was also a block of access to Parliament.
Jemenite media report from a transport chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the "Yemen Post" newspaper, Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called on the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened by information of the sheet with a further escalation of the conflict, his claims should not be met.
The Shitian Huthis fights for more independence of the Sunnitic reigned Jemen and demands the government's retirement.
The people's tribe of Huthi has been camping the Jemenite capital for just two weeks.
About 30.000 rebels have built protest camps on the large routes of Sanaa.
In the surrounding country, bloody fights come again with the Jemenite army.
Kenya registers officials to commit "centered"
Kenya has started registering all government officials biometric to remove "centered" from the government's balance lists.
Employees who did not register within the next two weeks would no longer pay, was a governmental communication.
The government suspects that thousands of people are still payable after their discrimination from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service in his application 2013.
In a test at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million per month were lost on payments for "centered" and other misused financial practices.
The government suspects that holders will continue to be paid on accounts after a person died or left the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
In the next two weeks, all officials need to appear at identification centres to ensure that their data is recorded on biometric registrations was reported in a government notification.
All who would not do this without a credible excuse would be deleted by the list of salary, the communication continued.
"This action is essentially contributed to the rationalisation of the public service by detecting the actual number of officials and also the list of salary is cleared on both governmental levels - so the "center-made" will be eliminated," said Anne Waiguaru, the Cabinettssecretor in the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal around the art advisor Helge Achenbach is first negotiated before court on 11 November.
Five inheritance by Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi-Gründer Theo Albrecht, demands in a civil process at the Düsseldorf Landgericht 19,4 million euro damage inheritance of Achenbach and two of its companies in insolvency procedures.
That's what a court speaker shared on Monday.
In the complaint, Achenbach said that when purchasing artworks and old-timers, Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices.
This also increased the agreed provision.
Achenbach has purchased for 121 million euros of value for albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He was 44 years in school service, 23 of which was a school leader.
From this time, Manfred Judges know many ranked Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as a pupil.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his striving to see people in the student.
The snow heads are the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountain.
Manfred Judge loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Judge was born in Trautenau/Nordbohmen in 1930, today Trutnov.
He was already interested in the teacher's career after four years of high school.
One year after that, the Sudeten Germans were uncovered.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bayern in the truck.
This way, it's the judge to the overlay village of Senkendorf.
Teaching was held in Bamberg.
As a result, Manfred Judge had to run six times a week to the next railway station, traveling to Bamberg, three kilometers across the whole city to school and return to the evening.
After two months, Manfred judges received a sleeping area in Bamberg at a Red Creuz House: with up to 15 students in a sleeproom.
In 1951, he made the second State Assembly the first and 1954 after three years of educational officer.
Since he had no free teachership for him, he moved to Oberbayern and came to school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Fräulein-Zimmer" was his first "Service" in the school house.
In 1958 he visited a three-room apartment in the newly built teacher house next to school.
This house bought Manfred Judge 1980 after the school was dissolved in 1968.
In Kollbach there were three classes in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the 1968/69 school year they were compiled in Petershausen in today's townhouse.
When the Indersdorf school association was founded, only the basic school remained in the place.
In order to escape a backstep in the now smaller school, the then Rektor Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Judge became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, so the children and her teachers were able to involve today's construction, which was extended in 1997 after judge's retirement.
Manfred Judge praises the uncomplicated greatness of the then Mayor Ludwig Götz, who also made a workroom and in enlargement in 1997, although it was not eligible for school buildings in accordance with the training directives.
"Bürgermeister Götzen was very school-friendly," judges remembered grateful.
In all his career Manfred Judge never forgot the talk of a government representative who had answered a referendum of a school council about justice and justice: "You must never forget love". Manfred Judge was about what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You need to give the children two things: roots and wings," says today 84-year-old.
And he had to learn, "This doesn't always happen". Whether only his students or also his own six children meant, is not quite clear.
In any case, judges were sometimes unconventional.
When pupils sprinkled, they did not get some criminal work from him and weren't confined to the seats.
At the expense of the community, Judges had made two pairs of box hands and left the two contrahensions against each other, even if there should be a veil.
For the benefit of the school, Judge as a reactor maintained a good relationship with the then Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the non-party Judge after its retirement in 1996 to qualify at least as last on the CSU list for the Council of the Communities.
But judge was chosen at place six and joined the CSU.
180 km in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bicycle riders are located in the Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and Scottish interstopps
When bicyclers make race on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scottishs, this is nothing special.
On Friday, however, only the number of stagnating impressions made: The 700 participants of the hr4 wheel tour had a break in the lower Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the Schottener Alteburg Park.
Among the motto "Rail and celebration on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and there lived a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was serious: the cyclists took the first stage, 60 kilometers over Florstadt, to Bad Salzhausen, and further to Scotland.
In Bad Salzhausen, the sporters were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had been started with the bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and the head of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and spirit, all kinds of good things were prepared: The country women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had 85 sheets of apples, twins, scatter and cheese baked, which were wonderfully mute for the twisting bicycles.
"Solke cakes can only back country women," praised a participants from Aulendiebach while ordering another piece.
The Geiß-Nidda’s drinking state was able to achieve cold refreshment.
The "Duo Bravo" interviewed visitors with well-known melodies from operats and musicals and harvested excited applaus.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
In addition, a Lord enjoys a head mass of his partner: "He has deserved it, finally he has held back on our bicycle chains now".
Thus, the mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed at the fountain before the drinking curhaus of Reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to purchase in the Radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Also Promotion Chief Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 wheel tour in 2004, was able to dispense shortly, but he had richly to do with the local technology.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with three phones and a wireless device with his employees and the 15-kick motorcycle staff of the police Hessen, wrote Facebook entries and reporting, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants are from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in North Rhine are riders traveling.
The number of participants depends on the overnight capacity available.
In Category I the participants are presented in hotels, in category II in collective accommodations.
From the curort, the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up again after a half hours: "Cause!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they wreaked for shooting.
After arrival in Scotland, the group was allowed to place a short discharge.
But in the evening the cyclists were asked in the idyllic Oldeburg Park.
Under the Schottener Society Registry for Tourism and City Markeeting (GTS) the park had received a beautiful festival ambience and, of course, he had a leckerery, such as flame cakes with well cooled spring whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS officer Markus Hoßfeld and MSC chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs welcomed the visitors as a member of ADAC Hessen-Holstein.
The three showed clearly delighted about the "great operation in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance floor.
Despite the sporty operation on the bicycle, the opportunity to move in free sky has been actively used.
Among the guests, increasingly citizens who had been encountered by the good mood as the great crowd of the cyclists.
On the second day, for the riders, the Stations Birstein, 1783sbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - stood on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Thousands of Turkish police arrested for the government's conspiracy
A total of 33 police were arrested in Turkey due to the suspicion of "suppression against the government", reporting local media agencies.
The police authorities did not give a direct comment.
Among the arrests are 14 high-level policemen, Hürriyet Daily News reported.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government workers, including four Ministers of State in December last.
In July, a number of Turkish police were arrested because they supposedly founded an organized criminal association and had launched phone numbers.
The Turkish President, Recep Tayip Erdogan (the Prime Minister at that time) described her action as part of the activities conducted by the Islamist clergyphulla Gullen against him and others in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after summer vacations.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and as thousands of other Ukraine parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had been opened again, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful heaven.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's face, must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Papiehow, school leader in Slawjansk, who visited the daughter of Jazenjuks, spoke in Russian.
We hope that here will finally be peaceful and that the children will receive an education that will be beneficial to them in the further life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing sticked shirts, keep balloons in hands and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
She fits with a proud rohmesslepp from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has its own front experience.
Her career began with Bain and Co. World Management Board company, where she changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearson's media world.
She was the chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top posts of the parent company Pearson went to a younger male colleague.
Their invention was supposed to be almost 1 million £.
Her political Ranking is also solid.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former President of BP as they looked for more private economic knowledge in Whitehall: she became the advisor of the cabinet.
Her husband is a former tory board member.
In May I described the task of the president with a poisoned cheek.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Confidency works in two directions: after the first ward of the own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and disturbance, if things are wrong.
This ensures a almost uncontainable duopol, which requires a complete comprehensive reform.
But the new President would risk to enter into all things and take up an institution that is so complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he may bring himself around his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that was not enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC less - power, money and status overtake.
While competition moves closer and threatens new technologies of old, comfortable safety, the upcoming negotiation of the license fees for the BBC is connected with special dangers.
For the moderate sum of 145.50 £ per year, the British public is buying into the world’s most important media companies.
The BBC tells a good story: she says that she reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 Pence per day.
And apparently the BBC rises up again on popularity scales: 53 percent today, compared to 31 percent, 10 years ago.
The sight and use habits for the BBC have changed: I today get news hits on my phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very loved and respectable institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that downset second was not authorized
A second from the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday, observed a decreasing remark on the democratic state lawyer, who is focused on a criminal complaint against him because of abuse of official violence.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry's user account, which abstracts the previous.
A second has been sent out of my account that was not authorized by me.
"I did not acknowledge the twin and deleted it," said it in the later message.
Perry employees did not answer immediately on requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who actually serves the feed.
In the former Tweet, an improved image of the district state lawyer of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, who was sentenced to the tax in April 2013 for drunkenness.
Perry filed a veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to come back, which could be a complaint against Perry - which might be Presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the second is: "I am not always drinking with the three-fold allowed alcohol level ... but if I do it, I appeal to governor Perry when he explodes it."
I'm the most drunken democratin in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not responsible for the management of the Grand Jury investigation against Perry.
It was led by Michael McCrum, a lawyer from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads on not guilty and called the accusation a political trick.
His high-class team of legal contributors requested in the case of the Judge to reject the claim and argued that the law which is conducted against the ministers' eldest governor in the history of the state of Texas was unconstitutional.
Perry stopped 7.5 million dollars of government funds to the public integrity of the State - which is established in Travis County and, in cases of state corruption in Texas, refused to come back as Lehmberg.
This veto ensured a public complaint by a left-by-side Watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing as a fifth at the election meetings in Iowa during his Presidentship candidate in 2012, Perry entered on speculations that he would stop by posting a second of a photo from him near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley explains the apartment market again for "normal"
One of London's most prominent building entrepreneurs pointed out that the apartment market in Southeast England was "to be returned to normal level".
Property homes in the capital were hot and objects of enormous price increases, which made the Bank of England due to the widespread fear of a credit blast to set limits for mortgage credits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since 2013" and added that this is a "stabil environment".
The real estate market in London was well established during the shift, as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
In the past year, the total increase in prices in the city area has increased by 18.5 percent, much more than the average increase in England and Wales.
The average sales prices at Berkeley's private, price-value and student offers increased by about one fifth last year and at the end of April 423,000 £.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate property in London for foreign buyers less attractive - some of them have also been disturbed by introducing new real estate taxes and political Rhetorik as a possible "gold tax" before the general elections in the coming May.
The London Immobilienmakler Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which more loan arrangements were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in both the sales of real estate and prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage consent in July, which also indicates the cooling of the real estate market.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 to 3 percent, based on a already weakening house price consciousness.
The transaction volume in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has declined by one quarter for the year, says the Makler WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, since the balanced amounts for deadline sales amounts to more than 2.2 billion dollars.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right product planned at the best locations remained stable and as a result the deadlines have remained stable."
In June, the company reported that 3,742 had sold new homes in the year until the end of April - almost one third more than the highest level of 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result increased by 40 per cent to 280 million £, the sales rate increased by 18 per cent to 1.6 billion £.
In a communication on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said that revenues for Berkeley in the current year were expected to comply with the current market expectations.
The analysts appreciate the annual pre-tax result at 450 million £.
Berkeley acts were held in London’s trade on the afternoon at 23.96 £.
Nacktfotos of Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by Hacker
Jennifer Lawrence appearance at the 85th Oscar release.
Nackt photographs of the Oscar prize driver Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "Masterlist" of images of more than 100 starlets.
A star representative from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and accused the hacker for "equitaneous injuries of privacy".
The authorities were notified and will follow all those who forward the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were reported by a lie in the online storage system iCloud of Apple. The supposed "Masterlist" of the hacking victims include the name of Dutzender female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos who have taken up my husband and I years ago in the private environment of our home - I hope you are so pleased with you," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" declares, however, that the photos deal with pictures of her and second "This so-called naked pictures of me are GEFÄLSCHT, people.
We're just about the beginnings. *World game planned*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a speaker of the Popstar Ariana Grande retreats the authenticity of supposed photos from her.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new Roman about love and the letter "J".
They were dispersed, so it was best described, they slowly got up like a cardboard that you had been in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, stressing, intense, distanced, and maybe somewhat scratching.
And then shake him.
He knew scratching.
He was stupid, like in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this tricky was a very starting affair, which was more promising to lend the lonely long-term of his life than otherwise, and may have even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailin Solomons was a cheerful kind of beauty with unfavourable hairs and a flattering heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more remote and rumor than port Reuben.
She came to the south with an older companion who thought Kevern for her aunt, and who had inherited a plot of land in a moisture but paradiesian valley with the conspicuous name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were lucky, in the baths were spiders, nakkins had left their traces on all windows and believed that all was heard, and the garden was overwhelmed with unkraut, which looked like huge coal pots.
It was like the house from a children's march, threatening as well as enthusiastic, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced in the next week.
Kevern had eaten with Ailin's hanging on the broken lounges in the high grass and enjoyed an unusual warm spring afternoon. Both had been inclined to the service console, which provided the country with calm music and sophisticating news when the view of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a longest forgotten entertainer, which his father would like to listen to closed rollsläden in the house.
Your feet are too large.
Due to their expensive aggressivity, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not prohibited - nothing was so properly prohibited - just not played.
It was successfully obsessed as the word is obsessed.
The general taste created what freedoms and regulations never had done, and as people in books choosed the ballads at the music of the music.
In the Euphory of the day, Kevern started playing a imaginary piano and singing large feet in a grob-comic Serenade Ailinn.
Ailin didn't understand.
"This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained her and automatically put two fingers to his lips.
His father always did it to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still young.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without two fingers about your lips, it costs you a penny.
It was not a very funny game at that time, and it wasn't even very funny now.
He knew that this was expected by him, that was all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailin has never heard what.
Jazz was not played, even if he wasn't prohibited directly.
Improvising was no longer modern.
It was only space for a single "if" in life.
The people wanted to be very sure at the beginning of a melody where she would end.
Similarly, the mind.
His unpredictability made humans nervous.
And Jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he had become 10 years old, without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about Jazz of the half secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he didn't have to explain that Fat's Waller was black.
In her age, she probably could not remember a time in which pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or forces.
A compliant society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of grouping - grateful as those dismissed by the fate.
People with afro-Caribian origin were suitable by temperament and body construction for entertainment and sport, so sang and ran them.
People who were originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were responsible for ensuring that no family remained without working phone.
What was left from the Polish community was about the channelization; what was left from the Greeks was scattered by Teller.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante whose grandparents had not left the country quickly than WAS WAR, WHEN WAR occurred, out of fear to be accused for fire, even for fear that the flames would distort them next - had opened labneh and Shisha-Pfeifen-Restaurants, thought and were depressive with inactivity.
Everyone after his capabilities.
Since she had only heard ballots, Ailinn was difficult to understand how the discriminationing words, which Kevern had just told her, could ever be shown.
Music was expression of love.
"They aren't really insulting," Kevern said.
Except for people whose feet are too large.
My father never insulted someone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the misleading feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound damnation of the huge coallike leaves.
Ailin still didn't understand.
Why should your father love such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he tend to put two fingers back to the lips in her presence.
She thought he was something unusual.
"It seemed funny," he said instead.
She shook her head ungodly and locked Kevern's view.
There was nothing else to see around the world than her uncommoned rabbish hair.
There was nothing he wanted to see else.
"If you say it," she meant without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're planning for me.
She seemed very worried.
Are my feet too large?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't so straight.
Maybe your knees, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my knocks are too thick?
You hate?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for it.
"Your thick knobles are exactly the reason why you're falling me," he tried.
I'm a little pervers.
That doesn't sound right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be funny, he was often in trouble because, like his father, he did not have the restant charm you needed to counter the gray in the widows.
Maybe his father wanted to be griefful too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailin Solomons became red and lifted out of her lie chair, threw the console and shooted the wine they had drunk.
Holunder bloom wine, so drunkenness wasn't an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to quote like palm in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I feel perversely drawn to you," she said...
Except I'm not at all.
She was sorry for him, both because of the unnecessary unfriendlyness of his words, as well as the fear that showed themselves in her eyes when she opposed against him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archiple where she was grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially as here.
The same huge and icecal ocean breaks out here as there on the banks.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and deceased to DEM WAS WAR as they had been their prerequisites as smugglers and beach cleaners, moved from knee to knee, always ready to lift the hand against a woman who refused or slaughtered them.
Dick head?
They had shown her a thick fire if she didn't fit!
She first knocked - Knutschen was the most commonly used word for a erotic attraction force between men and women, a contradiction to the nonsensitive love ball loads from the console - they knock and then beat.
According to Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the knee even represented an act of violence.
Ailin Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He lifted himself out of the chair like an old man.
She also felt bleeding, but the woeness of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They couldn't know.
She looked at him as he was away - as did from a room on the upper floor her companion seeing him in it - a man, distressed by something he had surrendered himself.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, his back smeared, defeats, without fighting spirit - why was this a look she seemed well to know if she couldn't remember a single time when she had seen something before today?
When she was alone, Ailinn looked at Solomon's feet.
Several years ago, Esme Nussbaum worked a intelligent and excited 32-year-old researcher in order of Ofnow, the non-legislative public municipal monitoring body, on a short lecture on the continued violence at low and medium level in precisely the national parts in which the reduction, if not being expected to be the highest, had been expected, in view of the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"It has been done much, and much has to be done," she wrote, "to address the inborn aggressiveity of a people who led thousands of wars and won most of them, especially in the distant corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human friendliness has been rarely felt historically despite the high-speaking church storms between the hecks.
But some properties are unequivocal.
The higher the church tower, so it seems the less the passion that he continues to wake up.
When listening to sentimental ballots, the population is stirred by stories about overwhelming difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only the former pride holds the rural communities as well as our urban plants firmly in hand, but there are also evidence for the existence of a new and disadvantaged dispute at home, at work, on the streets and even on the play fields.
"They have an unhappy tendency for exaggeration," her mentor said when he had read the entire report.
I suggest you read less Romans.
Esme Nussbaum cut her head.
I have to ask, are you atheist?
"I think I don't have to say that," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you lesbian?
Esme again referred to her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feministin?
Ready again.
"I don't ask this," said Luther Rabinowitz finally, "because I was against atheism, lesbentum or feminism.
This is a preliminary workplace.
We serve a prejudicative society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity that are absolutely acceptable and commendable can sometimes deteriorate results as you presented them.
They themselves have obvious prejudices against the church, and these things that you call as "containable" and "rough" could be interpreted by others as well as expression of a natural force and vitality.
If you continue on the round, WHAT IS IST, WENN IT IS, as if it happened yesterday, means taking the country its essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
After his head, a LED letter in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of hundred or longer.
Smile to their neighbors, value your partner, listen to Balladen, visit Musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen to, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the singing word is better than written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand what you want out," Esme Nussbaum replied with a quiet voice when she was sure that her supervisor had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing else than that we are still not as effective as we do ourselves.
My concern is that without warning, we may be able to re-establish how we repeat the mistakes that were only led to DEM WAS IST, WENN WITH IST.
This time, however, it is not the others where we leave our anger and our wrongdoings.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
In order to demonstrate an English guld.
"You go too far," he said, "if you call acts as "errors" which our grandparents may have or not committed.
They also go too far if you talk that they had left their "Wut" and her "fast trusts" to "others".
In fact, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are talking about "uns" and "other" when we understand the past as the protection of the present.
There was no "we" and there was no "other."
It was a time of ignorance, that's all we know.
"From the one, if we are honest to ourselves," Esme waited, "not part of society can claim to have good behavior.
I'm not complaining.
Whether it was bad or well done what happened.
That was at that time.
There is nothing to be said about this - we agree.
And just as no guilt has to be allocated, no debt must be made if such a eruption would be appropriate and if it would be a way to drop it.
But what does the past serve if we don't learn from it,
The past serves for us to forget them.
If I can say something about it...
Luther Rabinowitz made his pyramid collapse.
"I'll consider her report," he said and released her.
The next day, when she went to work as she was used, she was driven by a motorcycle driver who, as passengers described, was driven to the footway in a kind of "brutaler anger".
There are accidents.
Lesotho-Military Member says that no government was planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho have failed to have planned a governmentship for the distortion of the government and said that they were fighting against police who are suspended by the army of political fanatics.
Premier Minister Thomas Thabane flew out of the country and told that the army of the country surrounded its residence and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after reporting of attack threats.
Military speaker Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is no governments in fact, but the military reacts to the threat of "political fanatics", whose army was armed by the police.
"What happened today tomorrow that the stab of the defense forces of Lesotho acted after he received several secret service reports that in the police, some elements acting which actually wanted to guard some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were shortly upset up devastating damage," he said against Voice of America.
The South African government speaker Clayson Monyela said that military action has made the impression of a turnover.
"Even if nobody has claimed to have forced the government, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defence forces show signs for a governmentship until now," he said.
On Sunday, the soldiers told the military of Lesotho that they were going back to their casters and the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, the Vice-President Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the governance during the absence of Thames.
Thabane told that he believed he was become the target disc because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, many tensions have been made since June, after Daneane parliamentary meetings were suspended by the conflicts in its unity government.
He said that his actions would not have undermined the government, otherwise, claims to despite.
Production in the Eurozone on a 13-month floor
The increase in production in the euro area slowed down at the lowest point of the last 13 months in August, with a precisely observed study.
The final Market Shop Manager index of the production industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a state of 51.8 in July.
A reference of over 50 indicates an extension.
New jobs went back and factorys experienced breakdowns in a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures shall be adopted by the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect a clear plan for dealing with a deterioration of the euro area as well as the threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the Head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could make further information during this week whether it considers a quantitative enlightenment for the Eurozone, in line with those conducted by the UK and the USA during the financial crisis.
"Though a small growth is better than no growth, the brewing effects of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, governing economic scientists at Markit.
The PMI factory for Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU, fell on the deepest position in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, the second largest economic nation of the block, France, fell to 46.9.
France remains a worrying boy, as well as the decline in Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Notes that growth in the key industry mechanism of Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are no longer restant,” said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry probably shakes the fire of the analytics that expects other monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economic Expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the shopping manager's index of the production industry in the Eurozone of August is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producents in the euro area seem to find life quite difficult, since the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially in terms of Russia and Ukraine - are increasing in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy, especially the confidence of consumers, and probably cause some jobs to be delayed or even stirred, especially large jobs.
He said that it would be more likely that the ECB finally had to introduce a kind of QE, "if we suspect that this will be limited."
The hellening year of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the fearful deposit of the school, as the kids in it still suffer.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people of Czech militia in a school in Beslan in southern Russia were taken as a hostage.
More than 330 people, more than half of them, were killed in the three-day martyrium that the world shocked and killed.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had lost death at the Greueltat in the classroom.
Just a decade after the decisive deposit of Beslan’s school, in which 334 people were killed, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamic terrorists caught and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, seemed to be the evilst of evil.
The tragedy united west and east in Abscheu, and then surprisingly changed into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst.
Ten years later, we have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had been killed in the classroom at the Greueltat.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will be persecuted forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that the Ukraine now seeks - and in the children as they die - finds an end now.
The girl who was photographed during the attempt to climb back to the shot school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian Star Photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she only tried to climb back to the shot school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Aida was totally confused to seek her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were held for death, but they survived.
"A woman told me that I should run for my life, but I couldn't,' said Aida at that time.
My legs were overflowed.
I stood up and climbed back in to search for my mother.
A soldier took it in security.
After a series of operations, she was totally healed, but yesterday she said: "Threely three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I need to be operated again.
Some granate splitters are still in my knee.
Their goal is now to become dental physician to help people how she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says flusty.
"That happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once in the year, I'm always going to the sports hall to remind me of those left there.
My friends and I don't try to talk about it at other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva were killed there.
We played together when we were small and dreamed of going together to school.
"I don't want to marry until I end my study and begin my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the deposit will always remain part of her, although the reminder becomes somewhat weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
If I see the photo of me online, as I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help that something does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball hail believes that his mother was dead
It was his first school day (Russen went to school with 7 years) and survived the three-day deposits in the poor of his mother Tamara.
When he said seven-year-old, "Mama told me that I should lay down when it would be an explosion, and keep her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she'd die.
She said to him, "Go."
Full fear, she could be dead, he fled and looked on the way a crying little boy, took it on the hand and fled through a ball hail.
His father Wladimir, who closed his son outside into the arms, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save them."
In fact, Tamara was stolen outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, on the other hand, in the assumption that her son had come to death.
After her reconstitution, she said, "I was weeping for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and embraced me.
This later flew to London (from the now dissolved newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's children's champion from the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror pursued you every day, but I wish I could stop the reminder," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to be blasphemy in my memory.
I still know that I was throwing away all my toy pistools directly after that.
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes and that's not a problem for me.
"I have no fear of going back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these kids with whom I played in the courtyard and who didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember my journey to London very well, especially the toys where I could look for everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car above.
But now he has fears of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of calamity that he and his friends suffer.
This horror followed you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those suffering from the Greuels," said Damir, who worked as volunteers in a cluster last week.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope she's taking me at the school academic next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children were killed from our neighborhood, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the deposit, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She reminiscently remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London wept when I told our story.
I then understood how people can understand our feelings on the other side of the world and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting of her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and me helped.
I remember how Damir would like to eat breastshe and call her all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with chillns in a restaurant. So he shot with his water pistool on them and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: "I always think that this world has not become better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war continues now, and every day people die, and I think many children have been killed and still be killed.
These are just such children as ours.
I think that for many of the war, they're part of the news they hear when they're alien or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
This has become a big and is a very soft and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he does not look for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past Greuels.
I know that he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they sometimes go to the sports hall and kids out there.
When he was smaller, he was lying below - I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, turning the face from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I remember how he continued all his weapons and other military toys. In this way 17, larger than I, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so sure for some hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs, I looked around, and saw the hell around me, with all around body parts.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy couldn't have survived in this hell.
"I remember that I wrote to him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was so sure that he didn't hear me.
But he heard it and he went away.
And that's what life goes on for us, different from the many others.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image was made after the motion for the symbol of Beslan's Greuel
Trost: The Beslan survivors Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the turn of 2004, right a picture of Georgia today
His bloody face was drawn from fear when he ran for his life, while Czech terrorists shot his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols for Beslan's barablei.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had put him down for his first school day before she went off to bring her elderly son Wladimir to the university.
"I left the court for about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.
Not entirely alone, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer to this date, the more difficult it is to think about and talk about it.
There is no one day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's long here, I think it would have happened yesterday to follow some scenes from these days always.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
In fact, the image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was predicted as statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school this day and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I knew he was alive when I saw him in television.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden with us at the house in the book region.
I understand this, but I also think that people around the world feel our pain, thanks to this picture.
Georgeij says today: "It is important that this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we ever experience the truth.
People always examine such tragedy and never experience the truth.
And now they examine the crash of this boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever learn what caused him?
This world will be somewhat terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing in this pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few album rooms because of the moving, but then it became better.
I went back to school in 2004 and had fear every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I'm always going to the sports hall when the 1st September goes closer.
I want to sail my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel as a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I'm not going to forget, but I don't deal with it.
My life continues.
I completed the school this year and visited a medical university in Wladikawkaz.
I'll be heart surgeon.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgia Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived, although he was caught at feet of a murderian terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was caught during the moving at feet of a murderian terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the moving, he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was fortified at the foot of a murderian terrorist.
It's really a wonder that he wasn't killed.
"We feel as if it had been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go as a secret service officer to the FSB, but this couldn't do because of his healthy damage due to the deposit.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind me.
I am now older and the people say that children can easily deal with bad experience - I have to say that is not true.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and felt something better after that, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - in the year afterwards - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I'll never come back and don't ask me to show you where I've eaten in this famous picture.
Survivors: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of itself in the hospital after the mob on the laptop
My pain is unhappy and I wear him with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me after school.
It's good for me bodyly.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB Secret Service Academy in Sankt Petersburg as I wanted.
I have sent my documents, also medically, and they have answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institution.
I have two years behind me.
He teaches the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said: "I knew that I would never report my children of my experience.
Children should not know anything about this and, of course, should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary goes closer.
I'll go to the celebrations to the Memorial.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be much stronger for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help.
I am grateful to God that he was given me back here in Beslan.
It's in us.
Georgij's a adult now, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept that if something such unfriends fails.
He's a boy, he likes sport, but he can't participate for his knee.
He has been operated several times, he can run but not drive a sport.
I would say he overwhelmed the horror to 50%, but you can never overcome and forget it completely.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed at the mob and that just strengthened my pain.
I lost many people I knew and I was expensive.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart wept for the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It is difficult to accept that life continues even if you don't want it.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can't believe this.
We were a friendly country earlier, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure that in Ukraine many children have been killed and still be killed.
If we could only grab and throw out all these rebels - as far as possible.
Aljon Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was so seized by a special intake command in security
Gerettet: Aljona Tskajewa is put in security by a Russian special insert command (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not remember the griefs at all
The world held the breath in 2004 when the baby was carried Aljona in the arms of a Russian policeman from the mob of Beslan.
The terrorists left them to go, but in their dignity, their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar returned to school hall.
Machar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderian mud.
Her father Ruslan married once again and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana that he called after his lost daughter, Kristina.
Aljonna, today ten years old, does not remember the moving and is grown to a intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
They're gonna understand why.
Man accused to have overwhelmed girls on footgoing transition in Fife
A 78-year-old man stands on a footstep in Fife because of a three-year-old girl.
Gordon Steward is accused of having driven a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The claim suggests, Mr Steward has controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and the girl injured.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, departs the accusation before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC adopted the procedure for January.
4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point and shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition that both are for about $300.
I took these photos at a family festival with several cameras that are all available at a price of less than 350 dollar.
Depending on the equipment there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other fans are closed closely.
Add your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scenes and recording modes to optimize the lighting time for the steamy underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check until what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are allowed only for up to 5 feet, other than 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple records - because many will not fold.
Point-and-Shoot cameras have a LCD that allows you to compose images, action-Cams usually not.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to look at this under water, and the right image setting is a lucky case.
So you're doing many records.
If your camera has a series mode with which a series of recordings with easily modified lighting settings are made, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically bader, the further you remove from the surface.
So if possible, you stay close to the surface when you make records in a pool, a sea or a sea.
This allows you to also bring more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is so important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is especially important if you work with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, meaning that you need to get closer to your objects if they want to fill the entire frame of the image.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the species whose character changes things, even in a so gigantic organization like the NHS.
As anaesthesia doctor, he dedicated his career the task of saving both the sickness and the pain of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembered, was a MI6-worker who had to live with the devastating effects of tortures.
Lawson knew that the doctors are important to diagnosis and diseases, while the operators are mainly busy with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose passion began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble to get out of me.
While struggling with the griplike symptoms, he noticed that he made his wife Julia unthinkable.
"I want everything immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and unreasoned.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to take a X-ray examination of his breast.
He had been skiing in the French Alps first two weeks ago.
The result of the Röntgen testing occurred.
He suffered from mesotheliom, an unhealthy cancer that attacks the breastfell, so the lungs exercising skin.
As with most cancer diseases, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers illuminate long cancers, not all lungs cancers have been smoking.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber construction material, which once was known as 'woundary' but was now deadly recognized.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can be ignored as easily.
Asbest is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type has not been used in Britain since the 1960s than industry was voluntarily obliged to stop using it.
Also where he was still used, only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fabric - clepper, construction workers, roommen and yard workers.
As an industrial hazard from another time, he seems hard to be anxious today.
But this self-sufficiency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, today's highlight of a mesolteliom epidemic.
There are more deaths through Mesotheliom here than in any other country of the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die in this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual figures of mesotheliosom death cases since 1980 and expected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we experience the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999 all asbestos types have been prohibited), is that a mesotheliom has only developed after decades.
And the giel of the Mesotheliom is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbest was, and is often there in the houses where we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we buy.
And therefore Mesotheliom does not know class barriers, financial limits, professions or ages.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant purchase houses in London to private schools, are not a protection room.
The Parliament's buildings are asbestos enthusiastic.
Also in the hospitals where we are to be healthy, this mortal carcinogen has already been exhausted as the base of this deadly carcinogene.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a clepper either.
It was indeed difficult to introduce where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks like in the tunnels at Guy's hospital, where I completed my training for six years, there was a lot of asbestos." He wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and poets - use the tunnel.
Are you wondering how many of my agemates will suffer in the same disease?
He was unfortunately able to answer this question at least partially.
"From the four doctors trained at the Guy's hospital and who have been infected at Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in 2010, "I am the last one who lives."
How many of us will still be crazy?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at 48 years of age.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
It was an unusual long survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelio-markets die within 8 months after diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatal.
We can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us will still be illuminated?"
The leading British British expert at Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbest pidemie in Britain is expected to suffer, a total of 900,000 would have fallen for victims.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die.

A brief glance of the courts to which the concerned often apply for damage requirements shows how far the giel of the mesotheliom is already spread.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to have exposed Janice Allen ridiculously to have exposed asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the garment department at two locations – one of them of the flagship store in Oxford Street.
Mrs Allen was only 18 years old when she started her activity at M&S.
Now she has two children in the twins.
"Before this thing," she said, "I never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even know anything about asbestos yet.
I never thought that this would happen to me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos refers not to a substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name originates from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resistable and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as a white asbest, is today very often found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe risolations, boile riculatings, even for braking plasters in cars.
However, it is less fatal than other asbestos, but the EU and the WHO are regarded as a "great health risk" with possible death.
However, more dangerous is the brown asbest (Amosite) and the blue asbest (Crokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggested that "it is clear but indirect evidence that this was a main reason for the unique high mesotheliomrates."
A employees of Marks & Spencer was suspended in the flagship store at Oxford Street, London, Asbest
Janice Allen may not have seen itself as a typical mesotheliom victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her history is not unusual.
He has presented a study of those concerned in which it shows that "a essential proportion of the mesotheliom was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment without a well-known suspension by work or in the house."
A large part of these contacts is based on his statement according to the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like nobody could get out of being safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has examined the Palace of West Minster, shows how people could also have been exposed to the substance in the heart of the government.
In 2009 Goddard reported that the services and pipelines were infected with asbestos after the Parliament's committees, whose deadly fibres could be deceived by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused to take care of their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite.
While the Directorate of Parliamentary Working Service claimed that the West Minster Palace had received a "clear health certificate", it is now unable that 1 billion £ work effort has to be made over several years to renovate the Parliament, modernize the electronic installations and remove the asbest, and that after the general elections, the Members will probably meet themselves in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than in the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handed according to the respective provisions."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do is wait.
A person who could never determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general medicine.
As Andrew Lawson suspects 50-year-old Abbot that he was exposed to the asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital in which asbestos complaints were adopted positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places you have worked, and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, where he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45 and performed an operation just late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had shookfrost.
It came quite suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I didn't believe to make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbot knows that the pain of the breastfell, the skin around his lungs, took over.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom.
He didn't work a month.
Surprising doctors made X-ray records of his breast and applied Pleurakathether to take fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
His complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his job.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sporting activity and heavily breathing.
In 2011, a patient Abbott came with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesotheliom.
But even now, Abbot does not relate to his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbest.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's state was deteriorated and his CT-scans and X-ray records brought to a expert group.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a sun equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the breastfell.
I'm an Optimist.
I'm usually just going on,' he says.
Yes, I didn't have so much worries.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsie occurred in the week between Christmas and New Year: "You told me that it was mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnose Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had dates with Macmillan nurses, one of whom one recommended him to take an lawyer.
He first understood the extent of the epidemic.
"It found that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos in hospitals were below the earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who used to eat in pedestrian tunnels from a building changed to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground Canadians (should do Graham Abbott) came with the greatest probability in contact with poisonous substances.
It shows that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still being removed today.
Students put their buns burners on asbestosmats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous isolating and flaming properties.
Similarly, schools.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbest contact in classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, students have deposited their buns burners on asbestosmats.
On websites, the theme of asbestos in schools is now often addressed.
And there are such innocent objects in our houses such as floor plates or shoe roof roofs by default asbestos.
"It is an industrial gift that is included in large parts of our real estate," observed Andrew Morgan, the lawyer, who represented Andrew Lawson in his process against Guy's hospital.
In one case, the only contact that had been made with a woman concerned was the deterioration of a garden shoe in the 1970s.
So you can look at how you retreat your garden shoes.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is unhealable is imperfect.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went to work again and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I did.
I was in practice two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and care for myself.
Well, I won't see any other Christmas festival.
With the greatest difficulty, the perspective change was from the position of a doctor to the patient.
As countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to come up with.
"It was very difficult to take all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have yet?"
And you gave me about 12 months.
I remember I thought "Well, I won't see any more Christmas festival.
That was it then."
Mesotheliom is particularly hometic because it causes our life maintenance mechanism - the breath itself - that the deadly cancer.
Most of the cases of mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbest consists of smallest fibres.
When the asbest is cast up and the fibres are inhaled, they can be arrested in the breastfell, the skin around the lungs.
Asbest fibers irritate the breast fell and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem comes with the inhaled nadel-shaped asbestos," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-Torax-Arzt, who changed to Guy's hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital, from which Andrew Lawson suspects that it disposed him of the asbest, is ironically now, a leading center in treating mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who probably were exposed to asbestos during their hospital training.
Once the asbest needles reach the lungs fabric, Treasure says, "they are pressed from the breath operation on the edge where the skin is.
Of nature it is from the beginning of invasive.
The common options for other cancer diseases are not so good in mesotheliom.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotly controversial.
Some think she's worth an attempt.
Treasure refines that.
"You can't cut out the breast," he says.
They don't get around with the knife.
Thus, the cancer "doesn't be very good to chemotherapy," which "shows" but does not heal.
"Many time there is long-term survivor," Treasure says.
But at the end they die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become an in-man support and consulting office for co-committees four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer centre," he was happy when calling.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years before and was still very active.
Originally, he was offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last four months and expect to extend his life only by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson created it "to make things appear in a bit more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-Torax specialist at Guy's.
"We had a advantage by not being relocated, I just called and received an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would need to receive a transfer and wait for the authorisation of the treatment.
Money is crucial to mesotheliom diseases in order to experience the best available therapys.
But if these treatments eventually fail unnecessarily, many concerned are of another financial concern - about the future of the families that leave them behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what has changed in the 1960s that we realized that a very low burden also represented a health risk.
And here, the reliability of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital finally contributed to their case, but it was not what Morgan calls "compensation" as Lawson could not prove absolutely secure that his mesotheliom was due to an asbest contact on Guy's.
However, after his death study, a Guy's speaker confirmed that "the asbestos were removed in the affected cell range in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbest
In fact, it is a huge problem for mesotheliom diseases aiming at compensation to associate the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who weep against claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the applicants.
In response to this year, there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for mesotheliom-related people to complain a compensation even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has set up a fund of 350 million dollars, supported by the insurance industry, for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012, to prove contact, but no one can complain.
In these cases, the applicants will receive 80 percent of what a court could have been entitled to them in a normal reimbursement process - approximately 120,000 £.
Approximately 300 successful applications in the programme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan thinks as many mesotheliomes that 350 million £ represent a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurance insurers," he says, and indicates that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if the time would not have gone on it and Mesotheliom diseases find the companies and they could normally suspend them.
Mike Penning, then minister of work and pension, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in view of seven death victims, it was necessary to act quickly daily.
"The people suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Constitution in December of the past year.
At that time Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended a operation from which he expects a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by a radiation therapy and chemo therapy - a three-fold therapy with which long-lastunski can present a survival rate over five years of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course most important," says Abbott.
You're always seeing this in patients.
There's something that lets you go on.
If you give up, you're getting worse.
Graham Abbott went under the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Afterzorgescans did not show any signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer bottles around my breast.
I just became 50.
That's not life threatening.
That's life-consuming.
Six chemotherapy cycles were again undercuted.
No trace of the Tumore is visible any more.
But the process is physically and psychologically stressing.
You have to think of practical things - about the money if I am no longer, for example, or my wife shows how the boiler time setting works.
If you receive bad messages, you will be negative.
You need to look forward.
As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"For parents this is hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I would not be old.
They responded very differently.
Tamsin is very cheerful and immature.
She told her friends and we soon got very many calls.
Ellie was backholder.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients need to deal with.
But for mesotheliomarkents, such talks are not passed through hope, not from a trace of hope of survival.
The disease (as finally also for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a terrible security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life threatening.

China denied Hong Kong law on governmental election, demonstrants swear relievement
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided by Hong Kong elections despite the increased call for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for elections 2017.
This action probably firms the long announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists guided the planning and mobilization of the project within a few hours after the glorifying process.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle to reject all non-peking candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peking had promised.
The people were lying to Hong Kong.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an autoritary regime.
In its defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-General Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress said that the authorisation of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain returned the Chinese control over Hong Kong, Peking has promised to let residents choose the Presidency of the Government from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision from Sunday as a democratic breakdown because there is a direct voting right to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership maintains the process by a closely controlled nominalization committee.
After a new clause, only candidates should be allowed "with love for the country and love of Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public tests in Hong Kong took place for several years.
Behind the prodemocratic campaign in Hong Kong, the movement of Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to shooting the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real general voting right.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of ocupy-centre followers had gathered in the rain before the headquarters of the government in Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement reached a new level of civil disobedience and planted them in the coming weeks of protest waves.
However, they did not make further information to seem to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers informed that the movement "have considered the occupation of the central district only as the last means, an action that should only take place if all dialogue dances are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that all dialogue ties have been exhausted today and the occupation of the central district will take place definitely.
Since days, the Hong Kong authorities have prepared their preparation for Peking's announcement, and on Sunday before the government building, the security measures including police forces and barrikads were intensified.
The unrests are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their city.
The increase of people from the continent strengthens competition for products and services.
Moreover, the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, start to breach Beijing's growing pressure.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the occcupy central movement, as they risked the business - the lifemaker of Hong Kong.
"The protests they speak could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they are," said legal expert Regine Ip, who criticizes the movement for a long time.
We don't want fears to be scared that Hong Kong is outside control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also reported about the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western forces.
In this summer, activists organized an inofficial referendum to the voting rights of 780,000 people - more than one fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school balls in the United States will now be transferred to the universities where fresms are offered with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the UK's first luxury travel service for students today.
In order to reach a particularly impressive appearance at the University, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also indicated that the service has a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who, otherwise, need to cool their habits in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
With our new VIF options, we are pleased to ensure this year that students reach the University with a minimum effort and a maximum luxury.
However, a company speaker said that no new bookings were still available, since the service was just introduced, it added that "students would book the service in the next weeks".
The company also informed that, despite the study fees of 9.000 £ a year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as a deduction.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for University Education, said: "This offer seems to be completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who begin with study this month see a crisis of living costs suspended, since the available financial aids in the form of credits and subsidiaries do not take up the rising accounts for the simplest basis of life before they can think to spend thousands of pounds for something simple like the arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticize race and police behavior by Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang, "high, not shooting," while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the bloggrim Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
After their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to address reproduction law and income inequalities.
However, while the tensions increased in the Middle West and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers from white women turned to 100% around the race.
Compared with the answers of black women shortly after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays came with titles such as "Thinking to Ferguson from a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez this meant an important change.
"I don't think that in feminism you find many people who are white and speak privileges in such a classy way," she said.
People felt encouraged to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic for the crisis in which we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnized that they must express this.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from the Ohio State University, Ferguson brought problems to the light that black Americans are exposed every day, but that are not regarded as "women" in the cultural space.
"I can publish somewhat luxury on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from all over," said Mitchell.
If I post something about how colorful in their own country is under moisture, the sweat ohrenbetraying is.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about safety in the public room?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the United States history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the topics; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine the topics of race and gender into the feminist mainstreams, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University says that their predecessors did the opposite.
" between 1865 and 1890, at least 100,000 black men were directed and the reasoning was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the history to justify the Lynchord.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women's election law such as Susan B. Anthony analysed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for the right of election could only be a group of successes: Women or Black.
"They took the decision to set up for women's election law, and the right to election for blacks should come later," Hattery said.
If you remember such things, you will be aware of that with power why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't make our job good.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the voting right in 1920, it lasted a decade until white women organized against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group created nearly 40 years after the original request for the help of black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, race discrimination - a mirror of the time in which white feminists played "fangen" with the problems with which black women have been exposing since generations.
"Don't it great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to raise a child as seriously as they do it with the right to receive control?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation who have built their career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to reception preventive funds now try to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went to Facebook for two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, Columnistin of the Guardian, where she demands more protests of white Americans about racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a danger of inhabiting the body - and opinions on racials that are significantly different in public surveys - will make changes," said Steinem.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism, in which races are addressed as well as gender topics, some of their comments on the race theme in America are yet excited.
Christina Summers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stolen Feminism?" said to She The People, that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "is more harmful than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are in contrast to their former criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a little program, My Brother's Keeper, to help harmful young black and hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The ratio of the police to the black community is not the only problem that encourages the mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. Framework Police has noticed almost 63,000 unacceptable minor years at the Southwest border of the country this year, the topic of immigration reform will also come back to the surface – this time as a woman theme.
Andrea Mercado, Co-President of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for the immigration reform, said that for a re-examination of the topic as an essential woman theme they just had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"This speaks for himself," said Mercado.
When the large majority of work visas go to male immigrants, women who accompany them are in a position in which they are attacked for domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories can be found in the women's organizations," she said.
"Schweine-Haus" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed from real estatemaklers, when it became clear that it showed a great pig that made it comfortable in the living room.
The freezing house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 £.
The details belonged to a picture of the living room of the house - which also belonged to a pig that his head had beded on a sofa.
Immobilienmakler Connells said that the pig on the photo is the pet of the owner.
"The photo has been released misleadingly and has been removed in the meantime," said a spokesman of the company.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the former congregation house as a "ending family house with a bedroom."
Although the Makler has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The house sale was interested in social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.

Leonidas bat in Gladitoriansa
Not only the gladiators stood in the Matsch at the first Rhinebacher Roman Day in the leisure park.
But the attractive power of the event was strong enough to attract far over 1000 visitors last night, who were unleashed by the rain showers and herbst colds, and were excited by the historical spectacular.
There was a colorful reality of presentations, performances, games, exhibition pieces and information about the Roman time and their importance for the Rheinland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter trick of the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust fighting art with soft sand.
Gladiator's owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert presenter and sent to each other his men in the ring to the heroic twin war in various gladiators gates.
First of all, the "provocators" were at a series of rectangled signs and short-speed as well as legs on the left leg and armache on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with breastschild, short-speed and worst, as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressively, the appearance of the "Retiarius" who met worf net, trinzack and dolch against the "secutor" and struggling the fires to the ground after a short battle.
Because under the swords, the shields were surrounded by the arena, the surrounded by the swords could become an anxiety and bange for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposed "Summit Rudis", the muscular shade judge, had an always attentionful eye.
"We wanted to release the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman time alive," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römarkanal", the intention behind the spectakel.
After two years of preparation, the recreation park was a "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, as Vice-Bürger Chief Claus Wehage found in his greeting term.
Finally, the Romans have brought not only war and conquest in our region but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we are still admiring today.
The remains of this were also to be surprising during the Roman Day, such as the "Aquareduct-Marmor" of the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman-markanal bridge, which standed at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus company once and foremost presented water and energy supply, and manager Petra Fricke knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge of that time."
This also confirms Diplom measurement engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "Ingenieurteam Two" from Rheinbach, which presented measurement instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma and Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavation of anno 1894 and Ziegelsteine from the original hypocause, the hot air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Also impressively the footprints that were left by Wolf and Fuchs two thousand years ago in the footsteps of sound before they burned.
In 2011, the Office for Bodendenkmal care at the Landesverband of Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord-Energy Park in Rheinbach.
Conversion walls of a economic building have been found with a Darre for the drying of cereals and for males.
The building was probably part of a Villa Rustica, a agricultural good, explaining Archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morschiser.
A series of Funds from these excavations presented it in a glass vitrine, including a large counter, several fine glass vessels, as well as parts of a deceive necklace.
The villa may have existed after Christ from the first to the fourth century until the Germans in the time of Roman Rheinland, suspects Morschizer.
In her, the children also dealt with the Roman wind meal game, similar to today’s mill game, or, as once, they wrote the Roman students their names with metal handles on wax tables.
On the state of the Roman-therm dwellings, the children were allowed to put mosaics themselves, bastch the state of the Glass Museum Rheinbach Glasmosaiken and serve a heavy wheat meal of stone at the state of the Eifel Weberheim Nature Centre to meal the meal for a flat bread or a müsli.
With the Roman travel cars drawn up by two caltles, the visitors went through the recreation park and also passed by the impressive state of the City Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Week".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also enter into the rheinland widely exclaimed Roman year 2014, which should remember the death of Cäsar August 2000.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander Verein, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem are offered, among other things, thematic migrations, a lecture, cooking evenings and leaders for school classes and remember the Roman past Wachtbergs.
For example, a Roman legionist is told about his work on the close waitberg, presented plants as a living monument from the Roman time and offered a fun time of teaching in matters of genocide between a group of waitbergers "Germans" and attracted Romans.
The "Great School of Adendorf" is dedicated to the Roman theme in the context of a week of project.
With the Roman week, the numerous, but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be made available again.
In the Wachtberg Rathaus, a small presentation will be reminded of the founding of the Berkumer Matronicism in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic burdens Western African economy
The Ebola Epidemia in Western Africa is also a heavy strike for the economy.
Markets are lost - and international companies are remote.
The devastating Ebola epidemic of the West African economy moves a heavy strike.
The harvest rotates on the fields, the mines are left and the markets waist - the virus has hardly added the region.
Some international companies are already remote.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also a economic crisis," judged the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is affected by the hardest
"It is a total disaster, we lose very much money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothing on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
On the market only anyone wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia has been tested by the virus alone, the fever fell more than 600 people for the victim.
Recently, the health authorities stated that the disease had been prevented in every corner of the country.
The virus has also been expanded in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
Over 1500 people have died in total, thousands of more were involved.
Foreign firms draw employees off
Overall in the resource-rich countries, companies are exposing their operation.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal retract their employees, several international airlines no longer fly on the regions concerned.
The local merchants and farmers also respond: Just a few traders leave their homes to be concerned.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantines, the cacao and coffee beans were rotated on the fields for exporting.
The farmers don't care to leave their home for the harvest.
Food becomes scarce
"The people are going to travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris's expert for the West African economy.
For example, the man who normally goes on the market and sells its vegetables is rather staying at home.
The population therefore gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and urged to feel: food becomes scarce.
On the markets, the supply of basic nutrients, such as rice, disappears.
At the same time, the strongly dependent region threatens an image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The largest danger is that international companies avoid the area in principle over a long period, says Philippe Hugon of the French Think Tank Iris.
Be decisive how far and how long the virus will continue to spread.
In the case of investors, the impression was "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus also invest", says Hugon.
The disease also burdens the strapazed state budgets of the States.
The disease also burdens the state budgets of the countries concerned.
Moody's rating agency fears that their budgets are strongly strained by the high expenditure for the health system and also by the worsening economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (EUR 45 million).
The effects may also be in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oily region in the southern Nigerdelta has not been affected.
But many people are already staying home from fear of an infect.
Reservations in hotels also go significantly back.

The screen rule took over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füraker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" is from the year 1907, when the association was established on 21 March on "Societal Entertainment by exercise in room exploitation and small calibration shooting".
The NS regime had caused the association's resolution in 1937.
First of 1964, 19 young men have found themselves again in the guest house in Luke on April 30, the "new" firm "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the association as a Schützenmeister through a difficult start time in which it was most important to find an association site and install the shooting business.
During the autumn 1965, the Schützenverein started in the guest house "Leininger" with two teams in the round-west fights.
In the following years, the sports protections, which were now organized in seven teams, were established in all classes up to 1st Gauliga.
The association records purzeled annually and the magical limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of active protectors has increased, the number of members have also developed positively.
After the association's "Lijninger" has no longer been involved in the claims of a modern firm association, then the Board of State under the leadership of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future Domizil in the challenges of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work of 2700 hours on 8 May 1988, pastor Strasser granted the Church blessing for the new shelter rooms.
One of the major highlights in the club history was certainly 44. Gauscheßen, associated with the celebration of the new shipfoot in July 1991.
On April 23 and 24, 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated his 30-year-old founding jubilee.
In 1995, an elderly group has been established.
Joseph Schmalzl became governor.
A major challenge for the "olders" and the association in total was the orientation of the Bavarian Edition Meeting 2005.
In many hours of venue work, the association members have modernized the spaces and shooting plant in Berngauer Hof and thus brought them to the latest state of the technology.
Elf Teams in Rundenwettkämpfes

NATO will not break its agreement with Russia by the planned stations in Eastern Europe due to the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels, the NATO is the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO Chief, however, accused Russia of the agreement "a crazed fracture".
"Today, we need to see the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
From documents and opinions from Russian side, "they consider us as opponent".
Strengthen the NATO Presence
Rasmussen has also announced to want to strengthen the NATO presence in Eastern Europe.

Merkel says powerworth: Maut will come "to be clear"
Now the Chancellor is still aware of it.
But it is not a free letter for all complex details.
Heartful concerns from the CDU against the truck wall have devastated the CSU.
Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel, after continuing resistances from their CDU, has spoken a password for the introduction of a car wall.
"To make it clear: it stands in the Coalition Treaty, and it will come," said the Chief of the Party on Monday after meetings of the CDU-Spitzengemies in Berlin.
On a detailed model, Merkel did not first determine.
The black-rot government programme is called "decisive parameters".
Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal, and it is now going to work on".
However, the NRW CDU rears on her no to a wall on all streets.
Merkel stressed, too, Minister for Finance Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is constructively involved in the discussions for a draft law.
In addition, he also spoke with Dobrindt about further possibilities to enable more private capital for infrastructure investment, such as broadband expansion.
"There is nothing special." Schäuble had left a "spiegel" report on Sunday, his house in connection with his own concept to compensate autobahn investors with toll revenue - after the election of 2017.
CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer warned to develop maut concepts in the cabinet against the Federal Minister.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The Coalition Treaty never went out of being dealt with all circuit and federal roads," said the north-west-west-fälische CDU-Lande president.
In so far it is an important signal that sea stationers have now announced to talk about the topic again.
Resistance against plans also comes from CDU associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Pfalz.
The background is fears that a wall affects small border transport to neighbouring states.
Seehofer had demanded coalitiontreue for the toll criticism of the CDU.
The left considers the plans as failed in view of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said Party Chief Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"With the toll the minister fails". Dobrindt wants to introduce a vicious obligation on all German roads that should start in 2016.
Inland, car owners must not be charged additionally in accordance with the Coalition Treaty.
Therefore, they should receive full compensation for the wall via the Kfz controls.
However, the model may not disadvantage foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often incorrectly diagnosed
One British says she thought as a result of a failure diagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived nearly her entire youth in the faith that she had only a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
It actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inheritance disorders that harm the nerves outside the brain and the back mark.
Charity CMT UK reported that missing diagnosis is a common problem with people with CMT because so little about this disease is known.
Approximately 23,000 people in Britain are likely to suffer CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an insecure walk and crawled toes.
This disease is unhealthy and progressive, meaning that the symptoms become worse in time.
When Rodgers 13 was, she believed that she suffered in peaceful FA - a disease with very bad survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she was 18 and died before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children today, 51 years old, said: "When child I knew I couldn't do the same as the others.
I fell on my way and everything took me longer.
I could never go with the other children rollshoe or skateboard and was often going for my way in school because of my walking and running.
Rodgers said that in the age of 13, she had left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I told nobody, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA community," she said.
When I received answer, I was shocked and fired in panic.
I thought I would be 18 in the wheelchair and die with 25, and slowly all my capabilities would lose.
I made all this alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said, when she became 17, it became clear that her abilities had not taken down as much as she had presented it and asked her doctor.
He just stood up, and armed me and said, "my love, I don't think you have it, otherwise you're already in the wheelchair."
I think you've got something less life threatening.
After some genetic tests, their CMT was detected.
"When he explained me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT-Awareness month to make attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether works as a fireworker since the closing of the former truck exercise site
For some ten years, no more shooting in Münsingen at the former drip ventilation site.
Still, the munition still rises to death every month in the heartpiece of the Schwäbische Alb biosphere.
The granates are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be sprayed on the spot.
An ohren-beautiful chnall halls in the speeches about the heartpiece of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen Truppenübungsplatz, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since this time, the 6500 hectares of large area has been the core of the Schwäbische Alb region, which is open to 13 proven paths for hikers and cyclists.
Taxation of businesses in Washington increases with economic recovery
Recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax decisions for companies in the country have been easily increased last year, while economic recovery accelerated, thus a newly published study in the last week, and the companies in the Washington area formed no exception.
Companies in the district District, Maryland and Virginia shared $27.6 billion to state and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8% compared to the revenues of 2012 of $26.6 billion.
The company's state and local tax burden increased by 4.3% to 671 billion dollars last year, compared to 3.9% in the previous year, and it was the third growth year due to the several years of lower determination in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, thus the study carried out by the Service Agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State taxation.
More than half of the tax revenue of the district, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of the revenues of Marylands originate from companies.
Virginia reaches 28 percent of the smallest tax revenue from companies.
A large part of the rise in tax revenue is founded in a recovery of the real estate values of companies, researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent in this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these gains came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process seems to be true for the Washington room.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia shared over $10 billion to state and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over a year.
But the apparent reception of real estate values is not so effective in the increase in state and local tax revenue, as the real estate taxes are at least more than one fiveth of the tax decisions of companies here.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations who do not pay real estate taxes," said Munro Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to leave much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that offer other countries.
The latest recovery of tax revenue by businesses cannot only be calculated for the reception of the real estate market.
Company revenue seems to be recovered, as the data.
Companies in the region reported on income taxes in state organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took 1 billion dollars in business income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
During the trend in the same direction, local tax burden for companies does not increase equally at all three places.
The increase rate in the district corresponded to 4.3% to the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only Virginia reported under average tax income of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has 6 per cent of firms in all three areas of office with the most significant business income taxes (in all three firm taxes).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25% and in the district is relatively high 9.975%.
A comparable study of the United States Trade Board at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia lower state and local business taxes are required and a better tax climate as in Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbors.
North Carolina adopted laws for reducing its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same sentence as Virginia, and the sentence will decrease to 5 percent in the next year.
If the State continues to reach its income targets in the next year, this law may reduce the State’s income tax rate by 2017 to 3 percent.
In the meantime, small businesses in Washington seem to go better and therefore pay more governmental and local taxes, says the recent study.
Company taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businesses - a transitional structure that is organized by most small firms - increased by $2,4 billion in the district, Maryland and Virginia over the past year, a significant faster growth rate than the total of business taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in business taxes in the whole country will probably continue this year, with an increase in general VAT revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, the Washington area could be impeded if the government's expenditure reduction affects the labour market in the region.
Partnerstadt: German Bier for Guangzhou
Hope and malz - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now desires a brewery and also hopes for a flight direct connection between the two cities.
German beer, bride in Frankfurt’s partner city Guangzhou - so is the urgent desire of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would take place in our city," said the Vice-Participal Secretary of the South Chinese Metropole, Li Yiwei, in this week when visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
The functionary of China’s reigning Communist Party came back in the course of the discussion on this concern of the Twelve-Millionen-Metropole.
Guangzhou, which is also called Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities of China, was Li.
This is why people also involve the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD President Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who launched the German political delegation, said to the host that he would listen to a potential partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer it doesn't need much: good water, grain and life-frequency," he added to lunch with the party chef in Guangzhou.
This life-frequency already rayed Mr. Li, he tasteed the host.
After that, the guangzhou functioner met hero-gumble - but with red wine who was served for the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewery art.
Tsingtao-Bier is bruised after the German purity bid.
More business transport
A second wish from the Chinese host would be a flight direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, Vize-Partei Chief Li.
The Lufthansa had offered the flight before, but in 2012, for economic reasons, deleted.
"It would be worthy again," the municipal politician showed itself convincing.
"Commerce between our two cities continues to increase".
At present, travelers had to take the way over Changsha in the Hunan province, said Li.
The governance of Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The Vice-Gouverneur of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," said Schäfer-Gümbel - the Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate friend of Germany, nicked.
Partnership planted
Guangzhou's lizard Vize Party Chief hopes that he can visit Frankfurt next year at a partnership meeting.
Although Li Yiwei was already at the main, but not yet in this function.
He came to the office until this year after his predecessor had been transported from the office for corruption.
The local Party Chief Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against Guangzhou's functionaries is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in party and administration by state leader Xi Jinping.
Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American company, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before his office attack in Guangzhou, he worked as a top functionary in Fujian, where the autobuilder VW built a large work.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 kilometers away Guangzhou belongs to those who are maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropole at the Perl River is almost as strong with its economic power as whole in Hessen.
The next year they want to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, reported Li.
The family of Joan Rivers "inverts the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since its delivery to a New York City hospital three days ago; however, her daughter has shown her hopefully today that the 81-year-old committee was recovering from her disease.
"Thank you for your lasting love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a communication.
We press all the thumbs.
Her mother was given sources on Thursday after an emergency because of heartstilence in a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, to Mount Sinai Hospital.
The doctors keep them sedated and under the exact observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "natural".
The reactions came from many pages, also in the form of an overwhelming online support by Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmental friendly vacuum cleaner and rising wages
More stringent environmental standards are applied for cars and dust cleaners from now on.
Like cooling and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from 1 September receive a label on which the buyer can see central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, the pollutant class "Euro 6" applies sharper nitrogen oxide values.
There are also more money for the makers: they receive abundantly uniform minimum wage of €10.25.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON confirmed what information reported on Monday morning: The online single dealer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - purchased the videostreaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (970 million US dollar).
The announcement is surprising, not because no one had expected to take over Twitch but because far has been suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked as if the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was a cool billion decision, and cooperation also appeared naturally.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Rather, it was quickly a platform for players who wanted to publish their bread pieces in games, a "YouTube for Live Games", says an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a videogener, in which better exchangers give (most older) games an insight of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just so that YouTube is often called, if you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was somewhat long, a book book example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal did not stand with YouTube, because the company reported that it was ready to pay as much as Amazon.
All that we know about is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, honestly said, the unbelievable success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they are doing better sport than to look at it, it is difficult to understand the attraction that comes from taking others into hand instead of taking the control console.
It is one thing to look at a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning about the shoulder while she sleeps by Resident Evil, and something quite different to see a spinner in how he's shot 20 times in Call of Duty's head.
All these games could be viewed right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so the view can be a good recipe for headaches without own control over the viewpoint.
I admit that the quick passages in which the Roger Ban ministers of our electronic period are complete, are entertainable in record time.
But as long as there is not a game or Humorvirtuose, his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do creators like I know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic tips.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It is difficult to suggest that Twitch is integrated as elegant in Amazon Instant Video, as YouTube Twitch could have just sluck.
But Twitch has something that would like every company: thousands of young men who are being purchased as advertising customers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "glaub both in the future of Gaming," and the medium shows no signs of a scarf, yet not even - swallow - as a spectator's sport.
On the yard of the Burggartenfest, there was some time on the Sunday evening.
The concept of organizers agreed.
Despite the strong raingusse on Saturday evening, estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in Burggarten.
It was time to stop.
"That was angry," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, max Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
For the Open Air in the Salzwederler Burggarten is supposed to radiate brightness on the day and the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone.
This was already shown on the early Sunday evening when the first visitors made up to Open Air.
A festival for all generations had promised the organizers.
And this has been done to them.
Around the conditions of supply on the castle gardens it had made sout-wederlers, but also guests from the nearer and further surroundings.
They pursued the first live performances, wipped with the foot in the tact, enjoyed cool beverages - short: relaxation was made pure and enjoyable.
And it crosses through the generations.
While the one flew on the extra-carrished white sand on the beach bar, others labed on a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the after-wheel on the hipburg, who was a big attraction point for the smaller guests.
But also in the case of children, the volunteers had all hands to do in the truest sense of the word to become the Andrang Lord and to swallow fantasy creations into the small faces.
The sizes used or involved in a skateboard workshop that was based on the Good Foot Crew from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Soon before 17.30 p.m. he stood on the visitors, especially families searched for the wheat and dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not break this down.
"There came more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "consequence on the whole line."
That is why a repetition of the big party is not counting anything in the coming year.
Even though the content and size of the events still need to be worked, Sem made it clear in a first balance on Sunday compared to the People's voice.
As angry, he stated that in the meantime the opening had to be stopped.
The security company was evidently booked with too little forces.
The consequences: Some who had already paid were no longer on the grounds.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organisator spoke of about 1200 visitors who tumbled in the castle garden.
There were problems with the sound technology.
The Salzwedeler Hip-Hop-Band Blocks`Rox broke her appearance therefore.
The technicians were not able to create half-way sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to salt because of a mature pan.
"In the next year they will be there", says the organizer.
The Amula-Open-Air's premieres were more than successful by the visitors.
And that for bad weather.
However, the organizers have committed some mistakes that are being moved for the first time but must be removed at the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook, the organisers need to have criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," explains Melanie Meier on the event page.
"I'm sorry, you took over a bit," Ele Zimmermann says in the same place.
Others don't look very close to the initial problems.
I think it's very good that some are not just stupid, but also really trying to put something on the legs.
Hut out!" wrote Stephanie Jenß to Amula.
Now the organisers will continue a year of time to dismiss these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Waitberg's true signs shrinked
It is not expected to be that way.
Rather, the ready component is waiting to be used in the branding building.
The action is under the context of a larger measure: nearly 50 years after the creation of the World Space Observatory TIRA is completely renewed the cave, called Radom.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
The size still remains world record.
The last step to complete the new garbage is the exchange of heads
The upper quarter of the old garment is separated and taken down with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new garbage is set up.
If the weather plays, the action at the beginning of this week should go over the stage.
Participants in the Ice-Bucket Challenge are distributing Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Britain shouted as much as her cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket-Challenge went painful.
A woman was delivered to the hospital after she had shouted so much at the Ice-Bucket challenge that she turned out the cheese.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain crawled so much when her cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the face structure.
"The water was so cold that I shouted, and while I did my cheese was just standing," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is shooted over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that wasn't what the cheese was hurried, and then I understood something was wrong.
My mother and my sister also saw this and nearly in the cheek before laughing, but I had to get into the emergency.
The 20-year-olds from Britain were delivered to the hospital to re-establish the cheese after participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Do the castle clubs soon move again on a strike?
Recently, there was always Swiss between the two tungsten houses of Burgvereins.
Now the boards are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a example for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Burg, Richard Dimbath, former President of the Wolfratshauser Burgfriends, appointed the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the castle friends of Wolfratshausen.
There were different views that the history of the tungstenhouse's castle and possible reconstruction should be handled.
Now the two camps are moving together: there will soon be discussions on common action.
This confirms the firms Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfriends) on demand of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could put together once," reports Sjöberg.
He believes that all the members of both associations could draw up again in the future.
This would be more quickly visible successes.
While the castle friends around the suddenly died Richard Dimbath had a rebuilding of the castle at the mountain forest, the Burgverein around Sjöberg stands the "slots and relevance" of the site at the front place.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burger Friends, has been very pleased after personal information on the call.
Since Dimbath's death he has been presenting the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a member meeting in mid-September.
At present, the association is according to the 74 year old about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we had left the association activities of respect first." This "Denk phase" had been necessary to "assume how it could go."
According to Piffl, the new president will then go to the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also make a current voting image within their grouping.
There is currently no candidate for the Presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He does not want to candidate because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a tungsten house.
The Tölzer wants to work on the project "but very much more".
The different views in matters of reconstruction will remain in the eyes of Piffls next time.
He valued Dimbath as "Missionary", who always believed in the rebuilding of the castle.
Two similar, far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air-closure.
By high participation of the population and by voluntary helpers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I got more and more to convince that it is beneficial to advance the project". It could be created a "general setting".
There's nothing here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitors tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"The idea of reconstruction, therefore, I don't want to just throw overboard personally." He hopes that the Burgverein might move something about this point.
Their goal to document the history first is "is important and good".
After that, you could see further.
Clever paths for saving at universities books
Since the costs for universities books for many students spend more than $1,000 per year, the fast-twotsemester student Matt Schroeder held a clever Sparide.
He found a body system for students' books of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to minimize sales.
"My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks," Schroeder said 19, who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester had cost him $430, he said.
He gave $120.
The college leaders informed that students spend more than $1.200 per year for teaching books and study material, however, it would be different cost immigration options for the students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the skroeders are increasingly the solution to the choice for the students.
The rental of teaching books will be more popular, so students can use a book a semester long, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Nobo Inc, who has spent more than 250 universities booklets, informed that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of books had been rented in the college books last spring semester, Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all teaching books are purchased in Campus books according to the trade union National Association of College Stores.
Here's the once one for the best deal.
Buy Online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are in the campus book shop.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but it can be used for 239,99 $ for the specialized book dealer Chegg.com.
Buy Used
If you don't make any of the notes of other or normal tracks of use, books used are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for 93,49 $.
Matt Casaday, 25, student at the Brigham Young University, says that he has issued 42 cents on Amazon.com for a necessary edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold new for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors whether previous expenditure was allowed.
Sometimes the updates for seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of costs for the latest issue.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com is also a popular alternative for books used.
Rent
Renting teaching books is worth considering if you treat them somehow well, remember giving them back and do not want to keep the books after the course ends.
You can save more than 80 percent of the costs of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Inform yourself about the provisions of the business with which you rent, including the criminal fees, which may apply to the letter of notes, underlinings or use tracks.
Adjust: If you do not give the book back, the criminal fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books are also an option instead of conventional teaching books.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
In Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about 61 $.
Bracey says that students in literature can often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded for free today, while scientific and engineering teaching books can be very expensive.
Make sure you look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will then visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN-number for price determination in books, as you can be so sure to find the right book.
And before an online order you should check, Gault says whether the book is really predominant.
This lesson he learned on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college book shop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" was not a caseschlager
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only played 12 million dollars of his budget of $70 million.
The film "Sex Tape" played only 14.6 million dollars on the opening week, while children films like "Drachzähmen made easy" 2 also disappointed in revenue.
A article by the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that in the children's films the lack of quality in films could be the reason for the films.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "Drachenzähmen made easy 2" as a pure "functional" fantasy continuation.
But in films for a bit older target group it seems to be as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer film launch, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and the current year to at least 2000 line walls.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and suggested that this year's film heat is equivalent to those of the past year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing experiences and the growing popularity of web-Streaming services such as Netflix.
Regisseur Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's short-term junglebook film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times are changing."
We need to accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix achieved revenues with streaming maintenance of $1.2 billion, almost double as last year, in which sales were 837 million dollars.
In the last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios that they concentrated too much on comics films and prophesied a "clean melt" Hollywoods.
In the light of the current abolition, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy can contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cassettes expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline of the cash results recently as a simple "cyclic" and said to Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the largest summer at the cinema at all, and no one will worry about business."
When a few years ago the 2nd tabletennis district class was deleted for the punishment of the light division, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German tabletennisbund has taken an additional threeth Bundesliga into the programme.
The result: Whoever has not risen has gone down.
Thus Göttingen's highest class team Torpedo has avoided the decline in the Oberliga regime, but in the next season only five classes are played.
Fourth classy stays Torpedos Dames despite their grandiose doormarsh into the regional body.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of the SC Weend.
The SG Lengler and the Torpedo reserve arrive in the new associationliga, where Landesliga are no more goddescent clubs.
With the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the associationsliga, the Torpedo Tweet in the Landesliga.
What the composition looks like a better district class is now the new district overliga south.
Here TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammentedt, Oberen SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC.
As a regional representative of Dransfeld and the SC Weding, the district class of the TTC II, Red-Weiß, the upper SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III are playing in the district class of the ladys at least in Sollstärke.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen are launching in the district body.
With your nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district body.
Also the SCW-Jung Districtliga Staffel - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, TuspoWeende and the upper SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly founded region association, the two Göttingians start circularly with each nine teams.
The SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II are the Red White II in the West Station.
In the East Staffel, among other things, Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play.
Dames' crysliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemels, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weekend and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Easter Rode district, where there is no more women's teams at circle level.
Attention that none of the six 2nd classes of crying should reach, here the innovative and surrounded circular board will have to make thoughts.
Nato-Gipfel: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests of the Nato-Gipfel's opponents in Newport.
On Saturday hundreds of the center of Newport gathered into an anti-Nato marsch.
On Sunday about 150 people came together in Cardiff before the town hall there to keep a so-called countertop.
Stephen Fairclough has pursued the developments in the weekend and spoke to demons that are traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flee out of the Blue Mountains
TWEEI young bossers were taken in security with the winds of sailing after they were caught over the night at the Blue Mountains in NSW.
DAS 16-year-old girls and the 19-year-old man broke up to their tour just after Sunday afternoon in Govetts Leap.
Around 20 o’clock, family members called the police when the two were not returned home.
A search force from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found about 23 a.m. near the Bridal Veil waterfall.
The girl had been injured on the knee and the man was crashed and had hit his head.
Overnight rescue forces stayed with the couple, and they were fled tomorrow on Monday.
They were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in stable state with a healthcar.
Escalate government hostile tests in Pakistan
The about 1000 demons were forced by soldiers from the PTV building, said information minister Pervaizkkah.
The sender resumed the radiation after just a half an hour.
PTV-Director Athar Farooq said that those equipped with sticks have damaged devices in the editorial action.
Dead or infects have not been reported.
The demons call for the head of the government, to which they are proposing election fraud.
The police informed about about a kilometer from the Residenz of the Minister of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, it had come again on Monday to collapses of about 3000 demons with security forces.
After hospital information, a police officer was injured.
During the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured when demonstrations tried to prevent Sharif's Residenz.
They call for the withdrawal of the President of the Minister.
The mighty military had called on Sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters for a political solution of the conflict to "use without time and apply without violence".
The Communication also stated: "The army is still obliged to ensure the security of the State".
The escalating violence has scared concerns of the military, which has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests launched by Imran Khan and the Preacher Tahirul Qadri last since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif rejects a return.
Khan and Qadri had called their followers to endure on Sunday.
"We won't go back without forced Sharif to retreat," said Khan.
Qadri spoke similar.
Khan proposes Sharif to have won the parliamentary election last May by fraud.
Qadri calls for the withdrawal of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is to reform the voting system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in use to protect the national district.
The demons first had been peaceful before the Parliament until Khan and Qadri cried to prevent Sharif's Residenz in the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after second seasonsieg on place three of the table.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, Rapid took a bitter week on Sunday.
"The victory is very free," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an interior with the outs in the Europe League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed Captains and Torschütze Steffen Hofmann, who with green white at place three prestigious.
Sharmmel-Traumtor brings Rapid on Siegerstraße Rapid with the second season win the correct reaction to disappointment against Helsinki and goes with a successful experience to the country game pause.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leader-Volley from the Sixteeneck in the 14th minute, put the softs on victory.
"I thought I've got the whole frustration from Thursday and snatched him under the late," said 26-year-old.
On November 13, 2010, when Schrammel had done last time in a Bundesliga party, this was still for Ried.
The first championship in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in a special reminder.
"For me this is something very special, I'm out of the Rapid afterwuchs," Schrammel said.
Due to the short-term Becken-Blessur of Mario Pavelic, scrammel returned to the right defensive side and also made his thing very good there.
He has enough experience that he can reflect this position too.
The gate he deserved himself, he has already done a lot of assistants," praised Barisic.
Manship shows character scrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after good an hour, which finally made the decision.
Because of this, the guests could also have been able to write to this.
"By thanking God today, we have had some luck," also noticed screaming that played on the challenge of performance and results in recent weeks: "The results have not voted, but the player was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games were better than today" - against "the strongest team that played in this season in this stadium".
The first three points since 26 July have therefore proved that the team's company has been the backs for the despite of the intact: "He has shown my team that she has character".
For him not less delightful: "That we finally played to zero again".
Much work during country playpause Also the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have been complaining several cases, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their initial debuts more valuable.
"Don't forget this," said Barisic, who lost with behrendt and Pavelic players in the past three days, "they were very stable."
The country's playpause should therefore be used to leak "wunds and put a little in the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21 selection actresses in its series.
One of the most located breaks is Captain Hofmann.
He's snatching for the team, he's about it.
Just in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," said Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his change in the 68th minute, not only the structure, but also the second gate.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350. Bundesliga game, it was the first match from the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 via the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We have certainly had a little happiness, but at some time luck must come back to us.
Now it was highest time," said Hofmann.
He urged to continue: "It is not always black and white to see this.
We haven't played as bad in recent weeks as it has been shown.
We should not also believe that everything is good now.
The importance of his role for the team was unable to contradict.
It's a very young team that I can now help very much.
They're still watching me in a few phases," said Hofmann.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to present himself and his team.
He regulated the fast area "from the category of magician" as well as the regular gate of advantage in the 40th minute, which was known by Schiedsrichter collaborator to injustice.
The only preface I can make the team is that we were not exactly enough towards the gate in some phases.
We had too little conclusions.
Inland, Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started equally bad, but then we found clean and even made a gate.
In the Great and Whole would have been more in it.
Ruh is under this leaf.
We showed a powerful tribe in the summer series "My piece of luck" last Friday.
Several of these trees are still in the district, the exhibited copy is the "Geißruheiche" above sub-white brown.
A hollow footway leads up to the about 600 years old oak.
It passes through groups, basaltstein piles and basaltstein lakes.
A piece below the stone break from Bauerberg, a kilometer north of the street to Weisbach, it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it rotates beyond the other trees of the environment and remembers with a range of over eight meters of a U.S. mamm.
A small Buddha on a tree stove indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intense research, there were only references to the name origin.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted extraly the Bishopsheim archive and asked older people from sub-white brown to find out what affection it has with the Geißruheich.
The result of its investigations remained the legally nutritional declaration for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goathires are supposed to have driven their animals from sub-white browns into the muffy and freed meadows of stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animal guard should have rested from the rise.
In the meantime, the area has gained its importance back, for on the meadows actually refusing goats.
The area has also been explained to the core zone of the biosphere reserve, but cutter has been further discovered.
When entering the stone collections, however, you should be careful, because the basal raised by the sun is also a popular place for crossotters.
A hiking path leads from sub-white brown to the tree, which is hidden.
Other paths are painted, the direction rises up and invite to an extended hiking.

After weekly devotion, Italy's Prime Minister and Amtier EU President, Matteo Renzi, has enforced strong conservative resistance on the EU-Speaker last week the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of the EU's foreign policy, it is conducted by the successor of the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the governmental near daily newspaper of La Repubblica reflects, the calling of his national team as a favorite mogherini as a strengthening the position of the social democrats and its own in the EU.
It also expects a drive for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least hopes Renzi to calm down the ever-reaching left party base, as Mogherini is associated with this - although rather in the modest way.

For the EU's head diploma will at the same time deputy representative of the Commission President Juncker.
The EU Parliament's outstanding consent is considered as safe.
In other words, President Giorgio Napolitano would probably have nominated the 41-year-old politician of the governmental Democratic Party (PD) but would not have called a "worthy recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica distributes optimism that since almost two decades, the leaders of the leaders of the party officials, and for their ambition, Mogherini will show themselves the "normal challenges".
The poor Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began the promo-vierte Politologist in 1996 in the youth organization of the then democratic di Sinistr (left Democrats), which joined the Margherita Catholic Central Party to today's social democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Virgin Socialists).
With the 2001 Party Council of the Left Democrats, she entered the high party policy, worked in the Foreign Policy Department, whose head was soon.
It occupied traditional focuses on Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, was known by studies on the NATO entry in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a troop quota, the contacts with the European Social Democrats and the Democrats in the U.S.
Since 2008, she is a member of the Chamber of Defense and European and International Affairs, where she is expert.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his minister of Foreign Affairs.
If today the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent of the parties' votes in May, Federica Mogherini took part in the EU-Waals.
The maintenances in Brussels, the new EU officer has too little diplomatic experience, so it is missing from substance, the PD is renounced.
In Brussels, especially Poland and the Baltic members, are being persecuted as mistrayly realistic accent Mogherinis to the crisis in Ukraine and diffamated as "runland-friendly course".
It supports the Pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is intended to be transported directly to South Europe through Russian gas under the Umgehung of Ukraine, which serves the energy insurance of Italy.
After Renzi had arrived as EU chairman in July, Mogherini traveled to her first state visit to Moscow.
Photos that they showed with Putin at the Shake hand were taken in Brussels with embarrassment, as well as that they invited the Kreml base for October to a mailing economic summit.

Societies in France should "hold the mouth and bring France in order," said Francois Hollande's most important association.
Mr Valls called the deeply divided links to show "hulle love" for the controversial socialist presidents, whose cabinet formation on disapproval in the large majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay on his side," he said with great applause.
As an emphasizing gesture, the Prime Minister stated that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite severe demands for a locking of the rules of pages of Emmanuel Macrons, the new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his fellow Socialists to show themselves "connected" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, scattered Sand into the drive in which she came up at a meeting of a deceased Socialist Member and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the right leader of the National Front, mocked the constant grave fights of the Socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Vall's government will last for a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without dress, but Prince Manuel Valls has no, they are forced to form a new government if the old man hasn't survived a summer.
"And the new will not survive the autumn or winter," said Mrs. Le Pen against supporters.
She repeated the call of her party after a resolution of the Parliament and said that she was confident that she would come out as a winner during the preliminary elections and be ready for the government.
The French government party suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the legally justified national front was in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of the French are of the opinion that the Socialist Party is suspended by the danger of breaking into several rivalizing groups before the end of the Hollandse term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government did not aim to improve the economy and the record unemployment figures.
"There is a small window for opportunities, but public opinion must soon feel that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could further deteriorate.

A deal would have Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its prosperous customer, while with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
A agreement could already be announced in this week, said the sources on Sunday and warned that the conversations could also end unfortunately.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the Private-Equity Society Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also has a share of 20 percent in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked for an anonymous stay, since the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker refused a comment.
The in Miami located companies of Norwegian Cruise are 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the East Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.

Pro-Hongkong activists condemn China on the day following the election decision.
A peking-treu group was close to the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law which allows only two or three candidates for the management election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve the multi-annual support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied with peking-like members.
By this decision, it is almost impossible for oppositional democracy to be authorised for the choice and to allow pro-democracy activists to perceive their threat and to lahm with "Occupy Central" tests to the Hong Kong financial site.
Political reforms have long been a controversial theme in Hong Kong; and the China party leader fears that the calls for democracy extend to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which was presented by the pre-government of China on Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an inofficial referendum for the election procedure in the special administration region where hundreds of thousands marched and organized a Sit-in there.
Lis survey is organised by the Government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Association Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Vice-President of the Hong Kong and Macao of the Council of State, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced to gather in Hong Kong in the afternoon before the office of the headquarters.
Britain saw no democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin demands Kiev to take up "State talks" with the Eastukraine
According to the Russian President Wladimir Putin, Russian media reports on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government commits the fight against the separationists in the east of the country and directly take up negotiations with the "stateness" of the remote region.
His speaker Dimitri Peskow later stated that Putin did not mean that under the control of the separateists the area of the Eastukraine would be part of Russia, but that its status towards Ukraine must be redefined in order to give the Russian language region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to the Kiev Government on negotiations at a very high level with the pro-Russian rebellicals is true of the strategy which has seemed to be followed by him since the beginning of the eruptions of five months ago: help for the separateists to take areas and pressure on the Ukraine government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossija to make a facilitation of allians with Russia instead of the west.
In an interview with the state television channel one, Putin condemned the Ukraine military campaigns to retain the areas held by separateists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukraine peninsula Krim on March 18th.
The Kremlin and the separateists have recently referred to the occupied area as "Novorossija" or "Neurussland", a term which reminds the pre-revolutionary glossy time of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who are attacked by the campaigns of Ukraine politicians for the elections on 26th Oct and during the government groups of civil communities in the areas held by Separatists are hoping "in their illusions," reported Itar-Tass.
"We must take immediate discussions, not only on technical issues but also on the political organization of society and the state status of the Southeastukraine, in order to maintain the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to stateity in the context must be seen with the larger autonomy discussed by the Kievr leader for months to disperse fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can deliver the necessary autonomy to the east, said Peskow.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kreml speaker on the correction of the "feel interpretation" of Putin's comments underlined the claim of Russia in handling the separateist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct annection of the Krim, where the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more difficulty in reducing the regions of Donezk and Luhansk in Easternukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict gave a wide majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give full power to regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations and thus give the Kreml de facto the control over a territory that connects the Russian state area with the Krim.
The six months ago annexed peninsula in the Black Sea is the home port for the large part of the Russian marine, as well as an important commercial and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostow region in Russia and the Krim are also rich in mines, factories and caves, making the important components for the Russian military.
The Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislation, according to new elections, should consider additives to the Constitution, with which the respective areas are given greater control of their financial and language status.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast with those of the Kremlin and the separateist rebels whose army and upturn is prevailed in Moscow.
Putin's final request to Kiev to negotiate with the separate leaders at the height of the eye followed after another stimulus of rebels in the last week, after Russian forces and tanks are expanded across the pre-feeded peaceful region along the Asovic Sea to the Eastukraine.
According to the fears of Ukraine security officers, the separateists supported the first step in a campaign to take the strategic coastal region up to the Krim, the control of Nowoasowsk.
This is why massive civilian and military preparations have come to establish Mariupol, a steel industry port with 5000,000 inhabitants, which is between Nowoasovsk and the narrow access to the Krim peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urged actions to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just before a point where there is no back," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of strangers and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Group did not decide specific actions, the leadership required further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank colons and 1,000 soldiers went to the Donezk region last week to support the camped separateists, said Oberst Andry Listenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukraine soldiers, which were included by the Russian attack in Ilowajsk, were exchanged on Sunday to 10 Russian fall screens yachts taken to Ukraine, on Sunday.
Nackt photo channel for Australian promises and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten didn't heal for his trouble over Hacker, who probably stole naked pictures of his promised Gabi Grecko and one who stole the A-Promis from Hollywood.
The film city is excited after a series of unique photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence have been raised in a hacking channel for promis on the Internet.
The hacker responsible for this is well equipped with 60 Nacktfotos of Lawrence, Star from "the Tribut of Panem" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of the Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were supposedly also made due to an iCloud hole.
The list contains 101 promises.
Edelsten who had promised him with Grecko last month said confidentially, "It is wrong."
All private letters and pictures should be private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, reported reports because of a news web page that the hack was "shameful" and that the victims felt "injured".
The Hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-girl Scott Speedman, including two records where she is located above without a pool.
Filmworks Palmers include "Liebe is inseparable" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the painted images.
A representative Lawrence' said to TMZ, "It is a malicious injuries of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his second: "To posted images from a mobile is nothing but the sale of Hehlerware."
It should not be tolerant to the further spread of stolen images.
Radlers, Jogger and Wanderers were on the Great Fieldberg yesterday and thus supported the association "Help for crème children".
The tour for which one tour was, represented a light training for the other.
But in one one were all unique: It has made fun.
Thomas Studanski may have sleeped well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhause has been driven to the fieldberg yesterday.
For the good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle cat, especially the participation on the 8th wheels on the Great Fieldberg in favour of the association "Help for crème children" (Frankfurt) has also brought him a valuable knowledge personally.
A great thing.
"I know now that I can - good!"
Little pockets on the applause?
No, if I once stopped, it would have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is siting for the CDU in the Upperursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants were at mountains in the early future and neared the exhaust, but happyly on the plateau.
Others, however, were easier to overcome the well-eleven kilometres long route between Highmark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The whole green politician that occurs in red from the circuit day - red Dress, red bike - made something on understatement at the beginning ("every lot of professionals, there's the destination!"), but then on the mountain proved to be half professional and went through the destination after 45 minutes without breathtaking.
He also went through the route in a rod, as well as Nina Kuhn, press speaker of the city Oberursel, who had been along with Frank Greeneisen.
For the two triathlets, the "feldberg wheel" wasn't necessarily a sports challenge: "This is charity, there are we like to do with it - we have made a exit today," says Kuhn.
They had taken Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) was driven down in the morning to the upper ursel to stimulate the height.
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz had swung at the seat at 9 a.m. in the morning, "main" the fieldberg twice to roll home with fun.
I'd also enjoy "Fritten-Toni".
For the head of the Chief Ursel Kultkiosk, bicycle tours are just about the fieldberg.
He had pedaled 40 minutes with his 6.5 kilogram race wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says that he is a "ambitioned racer".
It must be, too, because he was on his way with the "Fixie wheel", that's also bicycles, but without switching...
That it went up without bicycle, not only proved to be the 20 hikers who went up to top over the white walls and the fuchstance, but also a jogger who drove a car mature with weights.
Bergwacht-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, who was equipped with his team with Allrad-Bully and Quad, said for security, "I know" from Frankfurt, who trained for a special sleeve trail, just that he holds the sleeve itself". So the man is somehow his own sleevehund.
The 718 participants - and so many as never - were sent to the route in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 p.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers left.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf der Großen Feldberg", gave the startup commands and wished the participants a beautiful trip.
For next year he hopes that it will be possible to lock up the route to the fieldberg to the security of the participants.
