Members of the Wales National Assembly are concerned that they will be ‘like with Muppets’
The National Assembly of Wales has been suspended by a proposal that would change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of the plans to change the current name 'Welsh Assembly' to 'Welsh Parliament'.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name is illusionate.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP is ‘reaching on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for puff.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group is as a whole 'entreated' and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his ‘open state’ party for the change of name, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar to each other.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is spoken as a short one.
The Commission of the Wales National Assembly, which is currently engaged in the drafting of legislation to transmit name change, said: "These are, of course, the members of the Wales National Assembly, who take the final decision on their new title."
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, the members of the Wales National Assembly were entitled to amend the name of the Assembly.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people found that the National Assembly should be converted to Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed 'Welsh Parliament Members' or 'WMP's, but the MWP option received most support in the public consultation.
At present, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have it difficult to reach a consensus, and she has to submit a legislative draft for a few weeks on the changes.
The reform legislation also includes other amendments to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the Committees System.
Members of the National Assembly will definitively be able to vote on their new title when discussing legislation.
Macedonian residents vote in a referendum on the amendment of their country's name
On Sunday, voters vote if they want to change the name of their country into the 'Republic of Northern Macedonia'.
The popular referendum was organised in an attempt to resolve an insulting dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province named Macedonia.
Atene claims long that the name of its northerly neighbour means that the country would make claims in its territory and has already made an objection against requests from Macedonia to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the national consultation on the change of name, said that he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, representatives of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is just the price paid to be a member of the EU and NATO.
The St. Martin's beams swear, who of Harlem have difficulty.
“The older people I spoke with said that there was a café and a church here before,” said Mr Adams.
Today there is still a café or a church to detect.'
He said it's understandable that cafés have disappeared.
"The men now have a different way of social contact," he said.
"Cafés are no longer the living room of the area, where people go on a regular basis."
However, he worries that the sales of the assets of the churches will be less long than the leaders expect, 'and they will be back at the beginning.'
Churches, adding it, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments where the kind of people would live that would not help in the remaining refugee locations of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of the people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,” he says, “who will cause these churches to be closed even faster because it is unlikely that the people who move to these apartments become a member of the church community.”
Both churches have ever been built by a white church congregation before Harlem became a black metro pool: the metro pool community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church congregation of white methodists has left in 1930.
A black church congregation from the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation under Rulem’s direction of John Howard Johnson, who led a boycot from the shopers in 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promovated.
In 1939, the building was seriously damaged by fire, but when the first-value parochians planned to rebuild the church, they also bought an arc.
Firstly, David Johnson, the son of Eer Wert Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, called the beard pride “the watchs of the poor”.
In July, the expert who played the supermarket referred to the instrument in another way: ‘a cultural treasure’ and a ‘incomprehensible historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first beard in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger beard of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martins are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some rented by the church leaders, others by the bishop.
The consistencyory (the governing body of the parochia, consisting of leaks leaders) wrote the bishop in July to express its concerns that the bishop would want to “compute the cost” to the consistency, although the consistency was not involved in the inhuring of the architects and contractors who sent Bisdom.
Some parochians complained about the lack of bishop transparency.
Shark injuries 13-year-old who are invented for crewd roofs in California
Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark fell on a 13-year-old boy who went to lobstered roof in California.
The attack took place just for 7 hours in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had duck with friends about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy crying for help. Together with some others he peddle to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought the boy called because he had arrested a laugh, but when he realized, “the boy called, ‘ I am praying!
I'm asked!"
His key leg was completely open,' Hammel saw when he approached the boy.
‘I shouted that everyone had to go out of the water, ‘There is a shark in the water’.
The boy was brought with a helicopter to the Rady-children's house in San Diego, where he said he was in danger of life.
It is not a knowledge of what kind of sharks are responsible for the attack.
Beach guard Larry Giles told in a press conference that was spoiled in the neighborhood for a few weeks before, but that one had concluded that it wasn't a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
The authorities close access to the Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and safety.
Giles noted that more than 135 sharks live in the area but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's want to break through on the British beauty market
Sainsbury's compete with boats, Superdrug and Debenhams and sets out beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as large goods.
The initiative is part of a strategy to acquire the British beauty market, which is worth £2,8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household articles continue to fall. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 shops throughout the country. If they are a success, they are introduced into more stores next year.
The investment in the cleanness market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill with other products where ever TVs, magnetrons and interior products.
Sainsbury's want to double his beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also the existing gamma of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees get more place, with table table by brand, as in shops like boats.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique-make-up on the market, as most products are suitable for veganists, some younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, parfumerie the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury shops. The first has been opened in Croydon, south of London, the second is opened in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
Because more and more people online shops and more and more dailyly buy small quantities of food in local supermarkets, supermarkets have to do more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the shops will look more and more like big goods, now the supermarket chain records it against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of Habitats since two years ago. According to the company, the sales of food has increased and the acquisitions have provided more return.
The previous time the supermarket tried to give his departments Cleanliness and pharmacists a makeover, that became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a cooperation with boats at the beginning of the 2000s, but the cooperation was ended when there was a conflict on the distribution of income from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacist departments in the shops three years ago for an amount of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury features for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: “We have completely changed the establishment of our beauty department so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialised training of our employees, which will be ready to give advice.
With our offer to brands we offer for any kind of will, and thanks to the attractive environment and the handy locations, we ensure that our customers are happy to buy their beauty products with us and no longer shopping in the old way."
Peter Jones 'woeding' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the issue of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'woeding' because TV presentation Holly Willoughby has withdrawn back from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is even compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presentatrice of This Morning announced on Instagram that she leaves.
Peter Jones van Dragons Den is racing on Holly Willoughby, because she has recently withdrawn from their profitable lifestyle company to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was ‘woedend’ when Willoughby Tuesday during a difficult meeting in the main foundation of the company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that she did not take enough time through her new contracts (with a value of some half million pounds) for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company is even compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and would expect Willoughby's fortune to double 11 million pounds.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones went to one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: “Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would ensure its long-term future and provide enough for the next decades.
Everyone was crushed when she decided to get back.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was soon planned.
The property of the main foundation in Marlow is full of products prepared for sale.'
Experts believe that the departure of the presentatrice, one of the most profitable stars of Great Britain, could cost millions, due to major investments in products of coasts and candles to clothing and homewear, and because launching could now rise further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been very friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became President of the company in March.
The two sets often go together to vacation, and Jones has a share of 40% in Baldwin television production company.
Willoughby becomes M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of the I'm A Celebrity programme on the British sender ITV.
A source from Jones's entourage said last night: "We have no comment on his business affairs."
Hard language “and then was the love between us”
He scared about the criticism he would get in the media for a comment he made that some people would find “inappropriate for a president” and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give so much?
Trump imited a news anchor when he said:
"I haven't given anything."
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore a major step towards the demanting of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have been tied.
More than three months after the Singaponist summit meeting in June, the top diploma Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a 'compatible reaction' by the United States after the first kidnapping initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States continues with his sanctions to keep the pressure on the chain, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election period.
"We're doing so well in North Korea," he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.'
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have resulted in positive results, and the missile tests have been completed, relieved, and the material surpluses of American militarys have been returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It is so easy to conduct you as a president, but instead of 100,000 people who are trying to access this busy arena, would stand here about 200 people,” Trump said, while he was to the public before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island, with hundreds of dead falling dead
In the aftersleep of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign ngos were heard that their aid was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had no residence, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for launching international aid.
"In many cases, it is unfortunate that she does not apply international aid, which is difficult for us," said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is working on the compilation of a team to travel to Palu, but it is not sure that the foreign help providers can work in place.
Sutopo, spokesman of the Agency for assistance in national disasters, said that Indonesian officials were still involved in evaluating the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations would receive permission to assist.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still very badly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, shelves were built to shoot at tsunamis, but along other coasts you'll see this rarely.
That there was no warning irene for tsunamis present in Palu, even though a warning of force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
In ideal circumstances, it may also be difficult to travel from the one Indonesian island to the other.
National disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital chip that was in Lombok to treat victims of earthquakes is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reached the place of the disaster.
The improvement of the hazardous infrastructure of Indonesia was one of the main points of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent abundantly a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the Government of President Joko has a lack of financing, and that while he hopes to be re-established next year.
President Joko is also pressured by persistent strains in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a preservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands had to leave their home because Christian and Islamic gangs were fighting on the street, with machetes, arrow, and bow, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool ensures impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool last Saturday for loss against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a target point in the 89th minute, during a match in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood on a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, at the moment that his team was behind 1-0.
He typed the left to the ball and then moved to the farest paal.
The ball floated high above the penalty area, towards the right upper corner of the net.
He got the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw edge approaching and wearing an effort. I didn't really think about it, I just created on the ball.”
Chelsea stood at the rest of 1-0, after a target of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues headed the ball with his helmet to Mateo Kovacic, after he speeded through the middle field to the play helmet of Liverpool.
Kovacic did a fast one-way on the middle of the field.
Then he gave a beautiful sting pass, allowing Hazard to reach the penal area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and shot the ball with his left feet over Alisson Becker from Liverpool in the net, next to the backdrop.
Liverpool plays on Wednesday at 15 hours in the group phase of the Champions League against Napolis, in the Stadio San Paolo in Napels, Italy.
Chelsea takes up at Thursday at 15 o'clock in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.

Standing image of Cromwell at the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history'-reference
The banning of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Talibanlike destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fantastic puritine followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described the suggestion of Mr Crick as 'dwaas' and 'a attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the fishing of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses or Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the past century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies the opinion that ruled in the 19th century and is part of the historical description of a figure which, according to many people, still needs to have acknowledgement.
Jhr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as the defense of Parliament against external pressure, of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a complete correct presentation, it is still discussed.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a individually recognized figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be acknowledged and considered."
Moordish pigs kill Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pigs on a market in southwest China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, from whom only the surname "Yuan" was known, was found death at a stal on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His victim was scattered and he was under blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pigboer prepares the intent of pigs at a pigstal, 30 May 2005, in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He would have been traveled from the province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and showed a door open to a neighboring pigstal.
According to the nephew, a large male swine with blood was found on his beak in the pig’s hook.
Forensic research revealed that the pigs of 250 kg had killed the farmer, says the report.
‘The legs of my cousin were bloody and blended’, said the cousin named ‘Wu’, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On images of monitoring cameras, Yuan arrived on the market at 4.40 hours on Thursday to carry his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan or his cousin.
A market responsibility told the Evening News that it was locked up to avoid attacking others, while the police collected evidence on site.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are currently negotiating a compensation for his death.
It just rarely happens, but there have already been cases of pigs that attack people.
In 2016, a pigs attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, making the husband seriously hurt.
Ten years earlier, a drill of 300 pounds [300 kg] a farmer from Wales pushed against his tractor until his wife left the animal.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten up by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba witnessed to CBC News that pigs were normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can exhaust aggression.
“ They're just games.
They're just kids, very curious, they don't care to hurt people.
You just need to show them the right amount of respect,' he said.
The orcan Rosa stake brings heavy rain to the southwest of the USA
As predicted, orcan Rosa has now reached the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa will, however, bring strong rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest in the coming days.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a orcan of category 1, which was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa's gonna look up to the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trog begins above the Pacific Ocean, which moves in east direction to the western coast of the United States. When Rosa is approaching Baja California’s skier island as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is swept northward, southwest of the USA.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeter rain to parts of Mexico Monday.
Then tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trog will cause widespread rainfall in the south-west in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm rain will cause dangerous floods, tubic flows and possible natural shifts in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to a precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Approximately 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapid deterioration conditions because tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is most strongly recommended to enter the desert when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can surround ravines into devastated rivers, and ignorance will produce local wind flames and dust.
The approaching trog brings some heavy rain to parts of the coastline of South California.
There is a 1.5 cm rain possible, which could lead to small tub currents and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in the rainy season.
Distributed tropical rain will approach Sunday evening to Monday morning, after which the rain will be distributed at the end of the day and Tuesday.
Sware rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the USA can shoot strongly because the North Pole becomes cooler, but the tropicals remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to great differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees.
In the coming days the constant summer heat will try to build up and expand.
In a large part of the middle and east of the United States, October would start warm, with temperatures that shave around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York the Tuesday can become 27 degrees, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the risk is large up to mid-October at above average temperatures in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people look forward to the Board's hearing of Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people were looking at Thursday on one of the six television networks to the prohibition of Board Kavanaugh, candidate to the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault that was reported in the 80s.
In the meantime, the political impass continued, while broadcasts interrupted regular programming for the surprise of Friday: a agreement by Jeff Flake, a senator of Arizona, was regularly to examine the complaint for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee for Justice that she is 100 percent certain that a drunk Kavanaugh scattered her and tried to remove her clothing during a middle school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a targeted testimony that he was 100 percent certain that this was not happening.
Probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
No figures were available for the other networks that sent the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty counting people watching in a office.
To compare, this is about as if for a play-off of a soccer race or for the Oscar journey.
Fox News Channel, that the appointment of Kavanaugh gives all the support, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: average 5,69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Also after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republikan issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the CNN and CBS cameras registered on Friday morning that referors cried to him when he tried to take the lift to a hearing of the Committee on Justice.
He kept standing a few minutes with defeated eyes while he was shamed, live on CNN.
"I'm standing here just for you," said one woman.
“ Do you think he tells the people the truth?
Someone called, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the lift, he added that he would say more during the hearing session.
The various transmitters are all out of sins when the judicial committee later had to vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote with that in mind that the FBI would examine the accusations against the genomineerth against the next week, something the Democrats of the minority.
Flake was convinced by his friend Chris Coons, senator and Democrat.
Flake took his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flakes' choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI research on accusations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses criticism of a political game around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Premier Theresa May politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union 'a political game' with the future of Great Britain and undermine national interests.
Premier of Great Britain Theresa May arrives at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.

Shooting Party Wayde Sims: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting party where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketballer at LSU, was shot.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned in the jail of death, said the police of Baton Rouge.
The authorities carried out a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his bril during the fight.
The police found the bril on the site and found the DNA of Simpson on the bril, reported WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police undermined Simpson and later stated that he knew that he had shot Way with death.
His borg is set on $30,000, reporting the Advocate.
The body viewer of the municipality in East Baton Rouge published on Friday a provisional report stated that the death cause is a shock wound in the neck.
The report notes that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the crime lab of State Police, the police of Southern University and local residents have all contributed to the investigation that led to arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva from LSU thanked the local police for his “intention and striving for justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm large and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He gained an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match.
On Friday morning, LSU-basketballcoach Will Wade said that the team 'capot' and 'in shock' were dead by Waydes.
“This is an event you always hope that it will never happen," Wade says.
Vulcan spoils as in Mexico City
The axis that is sprouted by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Rampen Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater was impressed and 183 gas emissions were registered in a period of 24 hours.
The center detected several times of garbage and vibrations.
Photos of a thin layer as on autoruits appeared on social media in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geofysici have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital. This is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a power of 7.1 on the scale of Judge's central Mexico.
The volcano called 'Don Goyo' has been active since 1994.

Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after pro-ondependence activists were successful with the oproer policy, while thousands of participation in rivalizing demonstrations at the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia which took place in two groups.
A group of masked pro-separists who were opposed by the oproerpolitics cheated the agents with eggs and powder paintings, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later on the day, the police broke out of screenshots, and the agents picked up their knee to stop the fights.

Fourteen people were treated for light injuries they were expelled during protests reported the local press.
The tensions continue to rise high in the independent region, a year after the 1 October referendum, considered illegal by Madrid, but by separatist Catalans.
The voters spoke overwhelmingly to become independent, although the rise was low and the people who are against divorce the vote of boycottes.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police had tried to stop the vote in the vote offices in the region, in which it came to violent screening.
Pro-ondependence groups had camped on Saturday's Saturday night to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration continued, but one was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electric who attended the separatist protest along with his wife, said that he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia to become independent.
“ Last year we met one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents cried of joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck,' he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties in December gained an essential victory in the regional elections, even though it was not this year, it was difficult for them to continue on their success. Many of their most famous leaders, either in self-sufficiency or in prison, to wait on their role in organizing the referendum and the calling of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old monarch who filmed the protest to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been stuck up on both sides by politicians.
"The tensions are growing up," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in the provisional commitment last year, stated that he participates in the European Parliament elections next year.
"A candidate for European elections is the best way to complain to the deterioration of the democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Livingston wins with 1-0 at Rangers thanks to the target point of Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston took care of them
The promovated Livingston surprised the Rangers and worried Steven Gerrard in a series of 18 games since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference, and the Gary Holt team was at the same level as Hibernian.
Gerrard's team did not manage this season to win an extinguishment during the Premiership. They have to take it on Sunday against leader Hearts, who represents eight points on them.
But first the Rangers Rapid Vienna received on Thursday in the Europe League.
Livingston remains uncovered. Now the team won six games after each other in his department, and trainer Holt has not yet replaced a single defeat since he left Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misss opportunities against strong visitors
The Holt team had long been able to realise a pre-sprong for the first goal, because their direct way of playing cared for all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but didn't manage to finish it with a target point, and then Alan Lithgow, who took the headball of Craig Halkett, the ball above the goal.
The home team left the Rangers play with lots of fun, and his chances waited quietly and self-certain.
And that finally led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase and Livingston to open up. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scattered from the penalty zone.
At that time, the Rangers had been in balcony for a whole time, but the defense of the home team was inevitable and the targetman Liam Kelly hadn't had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure that Kelly had to prevent a target point.
Scott Pittman shooted the ball against the feet of Rangers-Zielman Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a proposal from his Livingston colleagues.
During the time, the penalties of Livingston were proposed, but they were defeated every time. Two times a penal jacket was refused, one after Halkett's attack on infringer Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Fenomenal' of Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played exceptionally and continue to overcome the expectations in their race to the top.
Their play style and the composition of their team have been almost changed since their return to the highest regions, but in particular Holt deserves a lot of recognition for the way he has sworn the team since his coming.
He had so many heroes.
Managing director Halkett was fantastic, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on the tops of their tens throughout the game.
However, the Rangers did not know to break through.
Even if they have often played very well among Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they succeeded only once to hide the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they should play better, because they are standing somewhere in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a radiant blue heaven and with a wide smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany joined breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (29 September).
It was the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between the NAVO union partners.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of press and the accession of Turkey to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne for opening a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is the home base of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called on security reasons when they called the multitude of 25,000 people to collect for the mosque, but many sympathists came near to see their president.
Hundreds of democracy, many of them, too, have heard their voice and condemned both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The rivalizing protests reflect the division of a visitor who is awarded by some German towers as a hero and is accused by others as autocracy.

Orkaan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive effects on dry areas)
It is rare to reach a tropical depression Arizona, but that is exactly what will probably happen next week. This is because the remaining energy of orcan Rosa moved over the southwest of the desert region, which brings risks for flooding.
The National Weather Service has already provided warnings for sudden floods for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa will expect to hang just over Phoenix Tuesday. Monday evening it will already rain.
In a second, the National Weather Service in Phoenix noted that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a orcan in 40 miles from the border of Arizona.'
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeter, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimeter in the Moglon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Becken, will probably get 3 to 5 cm rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For the areas that do not risk floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, part of this rainfall will probably be beneficial because the southwest is currently having a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are indicated, something more than 40 per cent of Arizona transmits at least extreme drought, the weather.com reported on a second highest category.
The traject of orcaan Rosa reaches the continent through the Baja California schier Island in Mexico.
Rosa is still on orphan strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves northward with a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm strikes cooler waters in the Pacific, which weakens it.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive Monday in the afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm in Mexico.
Strong rain may fall in parts of Mexico, which brings significant overflow risk.
‘A total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible’ weather.
Rosa is moving northward over Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the border with Arizona in the early morning hours as a tropical depression, which then leaves Tuesday evening by Arizona and the south of Utah.
‘The greatest danger of Rosa or her staart is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and the southwest of the desert area' said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain will expected to lead to life-rising sudden floods and devastated floods in the deserts and earthly shifts in mountainous areas.

Trump says that Kavanaugh 'heats under the commonity, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the deceptive and harmless branch of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh constantly 'heat under the commonity, the anger' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh witnessed for the Congress on Thursday and denied powerful and emotionally the attack of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually touched her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford has also witnessed about its incense during the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said that the American people saw ‘ the beautiful and incredible character, the quality and the courage’ of Kavanaugh that day.
“A voice to recognise judge Kavanaugh is a voice that acknowledges one of the most complete legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service," he told the crowd of advocates in West Virginia.
The President moved indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he talked about the importance of the Republican encountered in the interim elections.
“ Over five weeks one of the most important elections in our lives takes place.
I'm not taking part, but I'm actually taking part,' he said.
"I am all over that for great candidates."
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to "stand and hinder us".
The first important procedural voting in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be expected to take place at the latest on Friday, told a top worker of the GOP guide to CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll becomes increasingly higher
At a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, with many of the soil fired when gigantic waves crashed on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of up to six meters of land sloegen at the time that it began to plan. Many people fell to climb and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the scale of Judges.
"When the tsunami drive was rose yesterday, there were people on the beach. They were not away immediately and thus the victim of the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spoken director of the Indonesian bureau for assistance at natural disasters BNPB during a lettering in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, trees, houses, he touched everything on the country,' said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami was traveling over the open sea with a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people knock in a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
Approximately 16.700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
At air photos released by the Office for Natural Disasters, it has been seen that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been wounded and crashed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city remained surrounded by wetlands.
The series of earthquakes was felt in a region where 2,4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (The bppT) said in a statement that the energy released at the enormous earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, small bay, has yet expanded the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “visibly” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels were crashed.
Some deadly victims were stuck under the puin of crashed buildings, he said. Some 540 people were wounded and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damages can be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenturity of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala 'lights completely flat, we have no information' said Nugroho.
There are over 3000,000 people living,” said the Red Cross in a statement. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on the road to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse," said the Red Cross.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday because she had not said that a tsunami Palu had taken, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time that the warning was given.
In amateur images shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a panic building cryes down the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later a wall of water falls on the coast and the buildings and cars are disappointed.
Reuters couldn't verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami provided a large current tower that cut off communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army currently sends freight aircraft with aid goods from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacués are still in need of food and other basic needs.
The city airport is only reopened for assistance and remains closed for the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit Sunday evacuation centres in Palu.
Dodentol of tsunami rises above 800.
It's very bad.
True, World Vision employees from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the interior of their office search for tenths of decades, but passed on the way of destruction, said Doseba.
"They told me that they saw many homes destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when helping groups started with the difficult order to launch emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financing, goods and staff from foreign countries can only be authorized if the location of a disaster is called out as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at province level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
'As soon as the government says: 'O.K., this is a national disaster', we can provide international assistance, but that status has not always been called out.'
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu on Friday, friends and family of the missing hopes that they would find their loved ones back, as in the miracles who like to hear people in terrible natural disasters such as these.
Saturday a boy was taken out of a riol.
On Sunday, helping providers freed a woman who had fastened two days under the puin with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian games, which had previously occurred in Indonesia this month.
His students were also in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi.
“As veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional tax," he said.
Dhr. Gendon told that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel was crashed had spread into the paragliding community and that he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the sporters in Palu, who participated in the beach festival in the hours thereafter.
In his messages, however, only one grey vink appeared instead of two blue wings.
“I think that means that the messages are not delivered,” he said.

Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name into Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: “The being that is formally known as Kanye West”.
The 41-year-old West is called Ye shortway and used this nickname as a title for its eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the start of his action on Saturday Night Live, where he expected to introduce his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who has canceled her action during the show for 'emotional reasons', says the maker of the show.
Ye is not only a shortage of his current artist name. Earlier, West told all that the word has a religious meaning for him.
According to me, "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "ye", said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album by radiopresentator Big Boy.
“ So I am you, I'm us, we're it.
I went over from Kanye, which means "the only", to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is earlier a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper who changes his name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy of Diddy, but this year's preference for names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously worked with West, has already worked with and without the link mark and the uppercases.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the chosen president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against citizens. The country stands on the spring of the 50th anniversary of a bloody represaille against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use military violence to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, with up to 300 people were killed.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people are often becoming a member of criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
United States should double financing of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend in A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this, following the announcements on A.I. that come from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I..
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: the country wants to be number 1 at the level of A.I. innovation by 2030.
"The budget for research on A.I. would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the USA, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.", said Lee.
Duration of financing may lead to a double of the chance that the next major achievement for A.I. in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the most important A.I. companies of China.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University at an A.I. system that defeated the best player from American Othello, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee spoke his appreciation for technology competitions organised by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next game would take place, because it would help discover the following visionary.
In the USA, researchers often need to work hard to get public subsidies, said Lee.
"China is not inclined by our best academics, the companies do that," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have acquired the best forces of universities in recent years to work on A.I.
Lee said that U.S. efforts at A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“ Who doctorates in A.I. should be automatically given a green card," he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences gives financial support to employees of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the American Defence Ministry set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to include partners from the industry and the academic world in the initiative, and announced the White House to form the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Alimited Committee for Artificial Intelligence).
And this month, DARPA announced that 2 billion dollars would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing over $100 million in A.I.
However, the U.S. legislation which should lead to the establishment of a National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence has been in the end of months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible name change in their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible amendment to the name of their country in the 'National Macedonian Republic', which would help Greece to resolve all decades and would no longer hinder Greece's Macedonian request for membership of the European Union and the NATO.
Greece also has a province called Macedonia and says that its northerly neighbour name is the name of the country in Greek territory, which, therefore, put Greece a veto against the inclusion of Macedonia into the European Union and NAVO.
The two authorities concluded an agreement based on the proposed new name in June, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and by a boycot campaign it is not sure that the required rise of at least 50 percent will be achieved, so that the referendum may not be valid.
The question of the voting note was as follows: "When you support the membership of the NAVO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
‘Advancers of the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, find that the price which should be paid is worth the effort of trying to become a member of the EU and the NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that have been born when the former Yugoslavia fell apart.
“I vote today for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the paraplu of the European Union, because this will lead to a safer life for us all, said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, sufficient Members of the Parliament have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
For the change in name, a second depression would be required in Parliament.
The national election committee said that there were no reports of irregularities at 13 o'clocks.
At that time, however, only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent during the previous parliament elections in 2016, when 66 percent of the registered voters came to vote.
“I am coming to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said the 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a selector in the capital of Skopje.
Premier Zoran Zaev van Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018 during the referendum around the name change of the country that would open the way for membership of the NATO and the European Union.
For the parliament in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small podium and placed chairs for tenths placed by people who were the referendum boycottes.
“We are advocated by NAVO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full-worthy member, not through a backport, said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European Asian integration.'
Premier Zaev notes that the NAVO membership will provide broad investment for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I am convinced that the vast majority is advocated, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are advocated by the EU and NAVO," Zaev said after its vote.
He said that a "yes" would be a result of "a confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required rise.
From another peeling carried out by the Macedonian TV station Telma TV, it was concluded that 57 percent of the respondents intended to vote on Sunday.
Of this, 70% would be yes.
If the referendum is successful, it must be 50% plus one voice.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious strike for the policy of the pro-western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes complete defense of Brighton and Scorp
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short measurements with the defense of Brighton in the Etihad Stadion in the English Manchester. Manchester City won the game with 2-0.
It seemed a flash of a cent, how Aguero scorde in the 65th minute.
The Argentine spits were first played the ball in the middle of the field.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, right in the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew to pass a defendant and was too fast for some others on the edge of the Brighton penalty zone.
Then he gave a pass to the left where Sterling waited.
The English attacker used his first action in the penal area to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his judge shoe to defeat the targetman Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the network.
“Aguero has trouble with his feet," coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City told the press.
‘We decided to make him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scattered a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first benefit in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's playground.
He sent a beautiful sting pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane kept the ball with him and then sent Sterling to the second paal.
The Sky Blues player typed the ball in the net just before he was too far.
City takes the Tuesday at 12.55 you are against Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The race will take place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play with and make it not easy for the Rockies to reach the playoff
Now that the Washington Nationals were eliminated for the playoff, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Yet, the ever competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still consequences for the participation of the Rockies in the playoff. They are currently one match for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have authorized at least a wildcard for the playoff thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals previous Friday, but now wants to do everything to ensure their first section title.
“Whoever there is nothing more for us, we can at least pepper with the knowledge that the atmosphere will be optimal with this public in Denver and the other team probably plays at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why would I not like to join that?
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sunday, but are probably inclined to set Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start his 34th, was in the inject box on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although it is normally its day of rest.
Washington's right handy turbine stands on 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organizes meeting in West Virginia
The President moved indirectly to the situation around Bord Kavanaugh, his candidate to the Court of Justice, while he spoke about the importance of the Republicanse appearance in the interim elections.
“All that we have already achieved is on the game in November.
In five weeks one of the most important elections in our lives takes place.
This is one of the really great elections, and I don't take part, but I'm actually taking part, so I'm coming up for great candidates everywhere,' he said.
Trump continued: “We see a terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, we see it happens now.
And they are determined to take the power back, whatever they have to do for it.
It doesn't make them out who they hurt, who they must go away to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we will not give them."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “stand and hinder us”.
“And we have seen that over the past four days,” he said, saying, “the Democrats called “boos, common, and false and lie.”
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Dianne Finstein, who is sitting in the Senate Committee for Justice, which led to loud call from the public.
"Do you know what she answers?
Did you select the document?
Oh, yeah, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a wide church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum voted in my local party to censurate me, that was not a surprise.
Finally, I am the latest in a series of Labour Parliament members who have not been welcome, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she was firmly encountered against antisemitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motif for censorship because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
As regards the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironic enough similar issues as Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Nottingham East Labour Assembly on Friday, it was stated: "We want the meetings to be included and productive."
And that was so during most of the GC meetings on Friday evening during the eight years that I have been local Labour Parliament member.
Unfortunately, this is not today the tone of many meetings and has been forgotten the promise of a more cheap, softer 'politics when she has ever begun.
It is increasingly clear that the Labour party does not clarify a deviating opinion and every opinion is assessed on whether it is acceptable for the party leadership or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, Collegas who knew I had a similar political view if I expected plots that I would make a turnover and take a position that I would not have agreed elsewhere, of subjects such as national security to the European unit market.
When I speak to a public, what I also say, there are skilled parties on social media in which is called for refusing my candidate for the following elections, making the politics of the centre clear and I am told that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am luckyer than some of my colleagues, because the comments on my address on general policy are.
I am impressed by the professionality and determination of those colleagues who have to deal with a breakdown of sexist or racist reactions every day, but do not let themselves intimidate.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that skilled parties are evidently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that wide church, and with every “motif of defence” or change of selection rules, the party becomes smaller.
For the past two years, I have often received the advice to keep me inclined, not just loud to preach my opinion, and then I would “not come into the problems”.
But I didn't go into politics for this.
Since I had been a member of Labour since 32 years of school child, provoked by the rejection of the Government of Thatcher, which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always pleaded for better public services for those they need most, both in my role as well as in my role as in my ministerial role.
I never kept my politics hidden, neither in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity on my policy points and my disputes with the current leadership.
To those who propagated the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country continues to a Brexit that will harm families, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy from my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, I have only one message, and that is not directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that threats to reject my candidate's time as a Member of Parliament for the next elections or that political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to me in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: unsaved Ayr on road to top
Two late trials may have made the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr is rightly triumphing in this glorious game of the day in the Tennent's Primeship.
They're now upstairs in the classification, the only unsaved team of the ten.
Finally, they were both their superior defense and their better chances for the home team of victory, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
“We have already had it difficult during our races and we are still uncovered, so I am a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: “All honor to Ayr, they have used their chances better than we have.”
Grant Andersons tried in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to a front jump for Ayr, but through a yellow map of Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors' race) Melrose could make the figures speak and Jason Baggot succeeded in breaking down an attempt.
Climo provided a penalty for an additional jump for Ayr and scattered a conversion after a solotry net for rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half good and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the forward to five points.
The race was quiet for a serious bleaching of Ruaridh Knott, which was carried down on a brancard, and as soon as the race was re-started, Ayr could continue to run further by an attempt from Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then the commander Blair Macpherson from Ayr received a yellow card, and again, Melrose counted with the extra man when no conversion followed a try from Bruce Colvine at the end of a game with the pressure was very high.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he baked Climo without the ball, MacPherson cared behind the exciting Ayr-maul for a touch-down to the penalty-line-out.
Climo cared for the conversion, and did that almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe sent the box kick of David Armstrong uptake and half back Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team.

The duo announced that the next ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan's life after Craig is already planned.
According to official data, he is the Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun left through that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the “blowing restaurant business” in Glasgow.
'The sea is of us: the Bolivians included by country hopes that the courts will reopen the path to the Pacific
Seelui patrouilles in a marine office dressed in La Paz.
Open buildings flock a ocean blue flag.
On all marinebases of the Titicaca Sea until the Amazon, the motto prevails: “The sea is of us.
It's a duty to win them back."
In all the country surrounded Bolivia is the reminder of the coastline that the country has been contested to Chile after a bloody nineteenth century, as the desire to refare the Pacific.
That hope may have reached its highest point of the last decades, since Bolivia is waiting for a ruling by the International Court of Justice, which should be consulted on 1 October after five years.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and naturally looks forward to the result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the judgment of the Court of Justice on large screens, in the hope that the tribunal in Den Hague will provoke Bolivia's advantage that Chile, after decades of pampering talks, is obliged to give Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous President of Bolivia, who is next year for a controversial fight for re-election, is much on the game with the statement of Monday.
"We are very close to the return to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
However, some analyms believe that the court will probably not decide in the benefit of Bolivia, even if that was the case, it would not change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the Chileense territory and indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
That the judgment of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the final determination indicates that the case was not complex, says Paz Zárate, a Chileense expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive result of Bolivia have certainly not improved, in contrast, the past four years the situation may have become even worse.
‘The case around the sea has been caaptized by the current Bolivian government’ said Zárate.
The warfare of Morales has all the good will Chile may have been completely undermined, claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk to their conversations at a certain time, but it will be extremely difficult to talk further.
The two countries have not been a ambassador in each country since 1962.
Former President Eduardo>>afr<< Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in Den Hague, denies that the court decision has been unusually taken quickly.
Monday, Bolivia will “except an opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile” and a chance to “stop an end to 139 years of disagreement, with mutual advantages” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the maritime issue as a political crick.
“Bolivia will never specify its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind us."
North Korea says that nuclear dewapening is only possible if it can trust the US
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot trust.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made during a top between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time that state Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be re-establishing the invaded nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un van North Korea.
Ri says that it is a 'utopy' that the lasting sanctions and the U.S. objections against a declaration that the Korean war is endorsed will ever get on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the declaration without that Pyongyang is first taking important steps in the field of dewapening.
Both Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump wants a second top meeting.
But there is skepticism, and it is doubtless that Pyongyang is serious if he says that he would disregard an arsenal that the country probably sees his only way to guarantee his security.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare itself at a second top meeting between Kim and Trump.
Modeshows in Paris reveal the latest collection of enormous main covers, soon to buy with you in the vicinity
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, do not look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of screamed oversized main covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a remarkable move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpractical hates were not to think these summers away from Instagram and these designers sent their eye-blinding creations the catwalk on.
The remarkable piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat versierd with a featherlike broad edge, which went to the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were water meloens occupied with noble stones, a magician hat and even ananas, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
In many of the colorful masks, the lips were tightened. They leached more on Hannibal Lecter than on the current couture.
One creation looked like dive equipment, complete with snorkel and bril, while another looked like a melted ice.
And if you want to follow this dirty mode, you're lucky.
Stylewatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing shops in your neighborhood.
The gigantic hats may be inspired by 'La Bomba', the stroop hat with a two-metre wide edge carrying everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that was covering social media also cared for another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in bathing pack that drove the bag.
The red orange raffia tas, decorated with raffia franches and finished with a white lead hungsel, was the most outstanding piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see coming summer big hats and beach bags in the shops. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a series of excellent exam results, and also individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives throughout the community.
With over 30.000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for continuing and higher education, the career chosen by them and their place as world citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we see modern languages of popular and desired subjects remain in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language that he understands, then you reach his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can not only trust in English when we want to build relationships and a trustband with people from other countries.
From the recent test results this year, we can deducte that languages are above the list, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
Overall, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data, collected by 74 schools connected to SCIS, shows that 72% of the students achieved high score (A) in Mandarin, while 72% of students from German, 69% of students from French and 63% of the students also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that will certainly need children and young people in the future.
Languages are now equally appreciated as a professional choice as STEM subjects (cision, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
In 2014, an investigation by the British Employment and Skill Commission showed that the obstacles to fill up vacations were attributed to a lack of language knowledge, according to employers.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
Now more and more vacant language knowledge requires, these skills are essential in a world of faith ballified.
Regardless of the career who chooses someone, when he has taught a second language, he has a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Directly communicating with people from abroad, a multilingual person automatically provides a competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent was unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation. French was the only language that exceeds 10 percent, with an total of 15 percent.
This is the reason why invest in language education is now important for today's children.
Several languages can speak, in particular those of upcoming economies, will provide children with a better chance to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools themselves select which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other schools will learn languages most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child is, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with teachers specialized in this area.
Scottish independent schools are working to provide a learning environment that prepares children and provide them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages remain vital in a global business environment for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I think it's fair.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Sunday his debut at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for the first match of LeBron James at the Los Angeles Lakers, it's almost over.
Lakers-coach Luke Walton announced that James Sunday will play in the opening game before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
There's still need to be determined how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than one, and less than 48," Walton said on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers-reporter Mike Trudell said in a second that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for the Lakers' plan for the six games before the season.
“In this stage of my career, I do not need any games before the season to prepare me," he said.
Period of elections of Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins to Wheeling, West Virginia, to a long series of elections
It is the first of five planned rally's of Trump in the next week, including stops in places healed, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he chooses for the job in the Supreme Court is waiting for Trump wants to build support for the coming interim elections, because the Republicans are running the risk of losing the control of the Congress when voted in November.
How late do Trump's rally start in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
The rally of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, start tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19th century.
You can view Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably have the hearings for candidate-in-Office Board Kavanaugh of this week, which will be charged by extra charge now that Kavanaugh is accused of sexual immorality and may wait for a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI examines the matter.
But the main objective of this series of rally is to help the republicans candidate for the elections in November to get more elan.
President Trump's campaign guide said that these five rallyes are intended to protect and expand volunteers and supporters in the next week, while the republikans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Delegates, says Reuters.
"Control on the Congres is so important for its programme, that the President is traveling to as much as possible states now the busy campaign season begins", said a spokesman of the Trump campaign that did not want to be mentioned by name against Reuters.
The rally of this evening in the Westbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday the second time in the last month, Trump West Virginia has visited, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tries to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West-Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who resides in the peelings.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to give him an angry in the peelings," said Simon Haeder, politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep the hope alive in the run to the Singles of Sunday
After three single sessions, the four seasons of Saturday afternoon were probably just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The shimmering slinger of opportunities is a fully discovered sports concept, but what players really believe in, and especially in competities like this.
So who's getting the best chances at present?
“They first had a spring of six points, and now it is only four more, so we find such a little that happiness is currently on our side," said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of its four points, while it is still twelve.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a bit of wind in their lines, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each three points of the four.
Spieth has been an too fearful opponent from tea to green, and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well, became louder as his round progress, and he achieved a crucial well with which game became a success when Thomas and his two points were behind after two races.
His wellt with which she won the game on 15 minutes was followed by a similar cry, the kind of one that you can distract from that he believes that the American team has not yet been reported.
"You have to dig deeply and you only worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all the things that these players can do.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unreliable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable, but glorious European duo has four on four and can do nothing wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that played no bogey on Saturday afternoon but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogey's.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their rough public, they are the players who have to be reported on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will ever be the most popular player who books a European victory when the sun is undergoing above Le Golf National.
Both preferred at the same time at different holes.
However, it is preferable to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short meters with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a retreat for the Spanjaard and the Swedish who didn't get over them anymore.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help to get your retirement.
The four-balls and four-some are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duoes, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and the way in which a strategy can change in an eye tip.
So far, the European team has played the best and has a good presidency in the beginning of the last day, but this four-some session has also proved that Team USA is willing to fight, something some, especially in the USA.
Europe takes the lead by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a beautiful jumping on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four balls and four seasons of Saturday they stand in the United States with 10-6.
The targeted duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari guided their team with two victorys more than Tiger Woods, who had it hard, which now led them to four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, that the trumpet that she wanted to lose two years ago in Hazeltine was stronger than the blunding Americans in the four balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the four-somes, where it won two races, but couldn't get his retreat again.
Jim Furyk's team has to have eight points of score during the 12 single races of Sunday to preserve the Trofee.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who wins four points in row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend but the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup are four points wins in their four opening races.
After they had introduced Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls, they were beautifully played together and defeated a disappointing woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who disappointed himself on Saturday by two races, showed a wonderful move and now he lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and foursomes and seven.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four balls of 's mornings, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the four seasons, and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
However, it did not go from a leading roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with three points on Saturday.
They won after a difficult game with 2&1 from the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later floated Pouler and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the four seasons after losing the first four holes.
It has only been twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to pick up four points at the beginning of the Singles, although the Furich team has enough equality, since they currently have the Trophee in hands.
But when she has been on the second place for two days, a counter attack seems to be too high on Sunday.
North Korea says it 'in no case' will evaporate without confidence
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations that the continual sanctions lead to increasing defects in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could not give its nuclear weapons aside.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN's annual General Assembly that the last year, North Korea had taken ‘improved goodwill measures’, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the location for nuclear tests and the promise to not distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
“We do not see any corresponding response from the US,” he said.
'No trust in the United States will have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not disarm ourselves unanimously.'
Although Ri repeated the recognized North Korean complaints on the resistance of Washington against a ‘phased’ approach to nuclearisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded as further steps were taken, it was true that he did not affirm the unilateral nuclearisation, as Pyongyang did earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim promised to work for the ‘the nuclearization of the Korean peninsula’, while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is looking for a formal end of the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reconcile the hard international sanctions against North Korea.
"The USA urges the 'firstization first' and increases pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compulsory manner and even by objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war' Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a aircasteal of the people who are unconscious of us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only strengthen our defects."
Ri didn't mention plans for a second top meeting between Kim and Trump, something that the U.S. leader had already been in the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the other party was in this issue of nuclearisation South Korea and not the USA, the nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impass."
Yet, the tone of Ri’s talk was significantly different from last year, when he said the General Assembly of the United Nations that it was unavoidable that Northern Korean rakets on the U.S. continent so that it was directed after ‘Mr Evil President’ Trump Kim called a ‘raketman’ on a suicide mission.
Trump, threatened last year to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim this year at the United Nations to take his courage to disarm its steps, but said that there should still be much to happen and that the sanctions must remain to North Korea.
Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this, "Of it is now two years, three years or five months, that doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
The U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, said against the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be continued powerfully and certainly until we have realized the complete, definitive, verified nuclearisation."
Since 2006, the Security Council has conducted unanimous sanctions against North Korea in order to significantly reduce the financing of Pyongyangs programmes for nuclear and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said that next month he would go back to Pyongyang to prepare for a second top meeting.
Pompeo has visited this year North Korea three times, but his last visit wasn't good.
On a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress was made, North Korea justified him from setting 'gangsterlike requirements'.
North Korea promised this month during a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take ‘reconventional measures’.
He said that Kim had told him that the ‘similar measures’ he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard follow course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to fight the growing machocculture in which it seems cool to study throughout the night and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor noted that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles to ensure themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Slaap Medicine to Harvard Medical School, a specialist connected to the Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course.
He got the idea to begin with the course after he had given a talk about the influence of sleeping disability on learning.
"To the end of my talk, there came to me a girl saying, "Why do I just get this to hear, in my last year?"
She said nobody ever told her how important sleep is, what surprised me,' he said to The Telegraph.
In the course, which is organized this year for the first time, the students are explaining the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve the academic and academic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University's Health Services, said the university decided to organize the course when students were determined that during the week had a serious sleep shortage.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, the students see an image of a sleeping room, where they click on coffee shops, curtains, exercise equipment and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way in which sports performance is influenced by sleep shortage, and the importance of a routine to sleep.
In another part, participants are heard how long-term sleep shortage increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
With the help of a rural basis of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that we will not change the conduct of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know all this, just as people have the right to know what effects the choice of cigarettes has on their health, Czeisler added to it.
The culture of fatigue at a night is still in the past, he says, and through modern technology and increasing pressure on students, sleeping is a growing problem.
Careing enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight increase, because sleep shortly ensures that the brain gives them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia, who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to set up the course for the past year, following the professor in Harvard when he studied his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to ensure that the course was available for everyone on the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a comparable study programme before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to set up an alarm for their bedtime, not only an alarm to stand up. They also need to be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disturb your aboutdiaan rhythm, which allows you to fall into sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Destination of Menga do the men of Gerrard undergo
The ranners saw their contradiction re-disappointing when Dolly Menga scorde and the weak team of Steven Gerrard defeated with 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first victory during an eruption since she was disloded by 4-1 February, but the team of Gary Holt cared for the settlement, nearly the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 games. His team now stands eight points behind Hearts, which continues to run out to the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga stepped for the rest at seven minutes, and the Rangers did not manage to score the equalizer.
The Rangers now bags to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third, with only a difference in the number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could even get more problems, since border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after apparently a object was thrown to him by the visitors' supporters.
Gerrard passed eight changes in his team and they stacked Ayr and went to the half finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed at the same 11th for Livingston, which the Hearts knew a point last week, and he would have been excited about how his well trained team would have blocked the opponents at every move.
The Rangers may have had most ball occupied, but Livingston did more.
After two minutes, they had to score when Menga had the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the vy, but the center couldn't finish it.
A deep free staircase of Keaghan Jacobs reached the commander Craig Halkett, but his colleague-defense Alan Lithgow shopped against the backdrop.
The Rangers did manage to take over the control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than that they really believed if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found in any case that he had the right to a penal hop when he and Steven Lawless bottered after a quarter, but divorced Steven Thomson won the request from the Colombian.
The Rangers were only able to shoot the goal twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was former targetman at the Ibrox, could keep the headball of Lassana Coulibaly and the tammed shot of Ovie Ejaria with ease.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute or not in extending the general game pass, no one can deny that they deserve it, even though it was only for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were not attaining the deep game pattern of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed cool and chose Menga, who walked the ball with ease in the purpose.
Gerrard cared for a break with the exchange of Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This move had almost immediate consequences when the wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly race away from his line to keep the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play the kind of game that Livingston plays the best, with Lithgow and Halkett keeping stairring long balls.
Holt's team could have expanded its lead in the last phase of the game, but McGregor was standing well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Infringer Glenn Middleton of the Rangers requested the end of the race to be punished after an experience with Jacobs, but Thomson looked at the other side again.
Almanak: The Inventor of the Geiger Teller
And now a page from the almanak of our Saturday Morning: September 30, 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom can be good TELLEN... the day on which the future physicus John Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device named irrigator.
Since then, the goatger is not to think out of science, and also became an icoon in the population, for example in 'Bells or Coronado', a film from 1950 with the first unlike cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘ What is that in godly name? ’
Rogers: "This is a tier telegrapher, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this headphone, you hear the effect of the atoms issued by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: “It’s really shooting now!"
‘Hans’ Geiger died in 1945, nearly a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that wears its name remains relevant.

The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change it into a labo
They can then see an protein “see” that often occurs in many kinds of cancer and then re-injected
A test vaccine produces many promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that the immune system teaches to recognize malicious cells saw her egg cancer disappearing more than 18 months
In the method, immune cells are removed in a patient, after which the cells are adjusted in the labo so that they can “see” the protein HER2, which often occurs in various types of cancer, the cells will then be re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “stimulates the growth of various types of cancer, including breast cancer, ownstok cancer, lungs cancer, and intestine cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and to “lear these cells” to take cancer cells had already been working in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanye West stops pro-Trump-tirade and carrys MAGA-pet after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That wasn't what he had hoped.
Kanye West was distributed during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an inevitable act in which he prescribed the US President Donald Trump and said that he was being President Skandidate in 2020.
After he had brought his third number of the night, Ghost Town, with his head a pet with the text Make America Great Again, he stood a tirad against the Democrats and repeated his support to Trump.
'If I talk to a white one, ask them, 'How can you have sympathy for Trump now? He is a racist!'
If I worried about racism, I was out of America for a long time,' he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood-star Matt Damon stake the dragon with the witness of Board Kavanaugh in the Senate Committee for Justice in connection with the alleged assault of Christine Blasey Ford accused him.
The west's tirad was not sent out, but comic Chris Rock uploaded it to social media.
It's not clear that Rock wants to get the dragon with West.
West also complained against the public that he had been taken backstage under fire for his pet.
“ They've treached me backstages.
They said: "Don't put on the podium with that pet."
They've dried me!
And then they say I'm apathic," he said the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Would you see the apathic look out?” He said he would attract her superman cape, “for that means you can't order me.
Give me some love."
From the public, at least twice crying up, and the castles of SNL lay in embarrassment, according to Variety. The magazine got from a present one to hear: “The whole studio was plots quiet.”
West was a guest as a last-minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, a few days earlier died.
West, many surprised with a implementation of the number I Love it while he was clothed as Perrier flash.
West was supported by the leader of the Conservative Group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who seconded: “To one of our most courageous spirits: BEDANKT THAT JE DE MASSA TROTSEERT."
But talk-presentative Karen Hunter swore that West was just "usually self, and that's beautiful."
“But I choose to reward someone who is a harmful ideology of my community, NIET (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his art).
He's free to do what he wants.
We also,' she added.
Before the show started, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, “the being that is formally known as Kanye West”.
He's not the first artist who changes his name, but diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collega-Rapper Snoop Dogg has also acted the name Snoop Lion and the deceased prince ever changed his name into a symbol and then known as Prince.

Game or Thrones-star Kit Harington gets out to toxic maleity
Kit Harington is known for his role of sword fighter Jon Snow in the violent middle-century fantasy series Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor takes out to the stereotype of the machoheld and says that young boys when seeing such rolls on the screen often think they need to be stunning to respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thinks that "there has been wrong," and he asked the question of how the problem of toxic maleity should be addressed in #MeToo’s era.
Kit, who was recently married with his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem must be addressed.
"This is a very important question for me personally: where did it go wrong with our malety?" he said.
"What have we learned men when they grew up, so that we are now faced with this problem?"
Kit thinks that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic maleity, through his very male characteristics.
He continued: “What has been born and what has been trained? ”
What is taught on TV and on the street that young boys think they should be a particular man?
I think that is one of today's great questions: how do we change that?
Because there's been something wrong for young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games or Thrones when the series next summer is over, because he is “clear with battles and horses”.
From November onward, Kit plays in a revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is overlapping.

Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits personage Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was round with an Emmy.
The link was married on the landgoed of Leslies family in Scotland in June 2018.
Hiv/aids: China reports an increase of 14% new cases
China notes that the number of Chineses increased with HIV and AIDS by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40.000 new cases have been reported.
In the majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was previously not the case.
HIV has quickly spread into some parts of China through transfusions of infected blood in the past.
However, the number of people who are in this way HIV has now almost zero, said Chinese health collectors at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000 people in China.
The transfer of HIV via sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
According to studies, the conservative values of the country estimated that 70 to 90% of the men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often, the diseases are transferred by inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relations.
The Chinese authorities have promised universal access to HIV medicine since 2003 in the context of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that staf-measurer has selected data from Republican senators and extracted them to “dangerous lies” and “complot theory”
The U.S. Congres member Maxine Waters is opposed to the accusations that one of its staff workers has placed the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislatures.
The Democratic from Los Angeles claims that the accusations are distributed by ‘extreme Rights’ disputes and websites.
'Lugens, lies, and even more common lies', said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The data published would include the private address and the private phone number of the American senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared on Thursday online. They were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Committee on the accusations of sexual impetus to the address of Board Kavanaugh, candidate judge of the Court of Justice.
The leak came after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address that the source of the posts indicates linked to the Waters office and contains the information from a Waters employees, said the Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is totally false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My employer, whose identity, personal data and security were committed as a result of these false accusations, was in no case responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a flagrant lie."
Waters' statement has already quickly stood on criticism online, including the former press worker of the White House Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds angry,” meater wrote.
“But here you can open that she does not have the temperament to be Congress member.
If someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't become angry.
He shouldn't be rebellious.
He must not ask the rights of the prosecutor.
He must stay calm and cry."
Butter appeared to compare the response of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by criticism of excessive evil during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take waters in the interim elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Happy, if it's true," he swore.
In her declaration, Waters said that her office had notified the relevant services and law enforcement authorities of these false accusations.
"We will make sure that the daders are known," she said, "and that they are legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff."
Recension: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spion parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and that seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films with a slappe spion in the main role, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was living in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this airy selfishness be about how bad we do it the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with exhaustive eyes and flexible facets will be able to send everything in the hundred, also with his second comeback. From his name you can already suggest that he is a common comic person that was considered for bioscoopers in countries where one speaks a different language than English.
He is of course the dread secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, is a little Clauseau, a plane of Mr Bean and a grain of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots or Fire during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mystery man who ever played Atkinson in the Barclaycard TV (forgot everyone in the meantime) who always leaves a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved it how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his mid-century armor equipment and the rotor leafs even against his helmet.
Atkinson can show well how much talent he has for physical comedie, but the humor is rather weakly over and thin enough, especially now the "serious" film series such as 007 and Mission Impossible self comedie includes as ingredients, and that is good.
The humor seems rather designed for children than for adults, and the delicate disaster of Johnny English is less original and focused on me than the grapes without the text of the personage Bean that plays atkinson.
The constant theme is now that Great Britain is in great difficulties.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super secret spionn network on the web, thus the identity of all active secret agents of Great Britain has become known to great deployment of the agent in function, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That is the drop of the bucket overflowing from the first minister, a funny woman with problems with her head and terrible unpopulary as a politician. Emma Thompson is doing its utmost best with this personage that is thinking of Teresa May, but the script does not offer much material to work with it.
According to her information advisers, she has to set up a retirement spion, as every active spion is compromitted.
And that means the stunteling Johnny English itself, which now works as a school master in a chic institution, but unofficial lessons about undercovering. Here are fun grapes in the story, because the spionage lessons of English think about school or rock.
English is quickly released on Whitehall for a emergency lettering and refined with his former souly Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is Captain of a subsea, an immoral and joviale role under Vicki Pepperdines level.
So the Batman and Robin of the catastrophic conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's blood-made femma fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the first minister is unfortunately falling for charms of charismatic technology million, claiming that he can solve the British computer problems: the sunny Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin at their dyessee of plenty of fun: clothing as obers they shake a respective French restaurant in burning, they shoot rearry on board the Volta luxury and English dishes pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to trust the interior of Volta's house.
Before that last, all registers are opened, but how well-determined and intactly the scene is, they do what is thinking of childtelevision.
It's not all very original.
And just as with the other movies of Johnny English, I ask myself the question: can the British film sector really not take any part in the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
Labour denied that the party is a plan in which British work four days a week, but is paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn would consider a radical plan, with British work four days a week, but has been paid for five days.
According to the fact, the party would wish that firms of companies would spend savings they are doing due to the revolution of Artificial Intelligency (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day vacation.
In this way, employees can enjoy a weekend of three days, but still deserve as much as possible.
According to sources ‘pass’, the idea in the economic agenda of the party and the plans to make the country’s balance in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Association of Vacancies that it is a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high source from the Labour party said to The Sunday Times: “Towards, a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place from one at the other time, but a four-day working week is an objective that fits within the effort of the party to make the balance in the economy more favourable to the workers and that also fits within the entire industrial strategy of the party."
Labour is not the first party supporting such an idea in view of the fact that the Green Party has promised a four-day working week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the entire Labour Party is currently not supported by the efforts.
A speaker of the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a policy of the party and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to make his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy clear.
McDonnell said he was determined to take the power from the "sight-less drivers" and the "profiteurs" of the utility companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their share, as a Labour government could apply "deficiencies" based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to take up employees in the boards of management of companies and to set up inclusive property funds (including property funds) to provide 10% of the shares of companies from the private sector to workers who can earn up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the research of the FBI to Kavanaugh could make them change
The FBI’s investigation on accusations against Judge Board Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on its nomination for the Court of Justice with at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the FBI could ensure that Republican Senatoren withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview sent at '60 minutes' on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senatoren John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI could discover something that could lead to changing their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said for the hearing that I spoke to judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him "Do you do it?"
He was absolute, determined, unthinkable."
However, Graham's voice seems to have a wallvast.
"My opinion about board Kavanaugh is fired and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"What Dr. Ford is, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Board has denied it powerfully," said Graham added to this, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And nobody mentioned by her could verify it.
It's 36 years ago.
I do not see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday is organized at the Global Citizen Festival in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up to stars will occur and that a even impressive mission knows: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Laws in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: finishing extreme poverty for 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting here.
Concertgangers who wish to authorize a free card for the event (when they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to generate a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteer work, a world leader e-mails, a phone talk, or another significant awareness for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has been the Global Citizen Festival, with more than 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an appropriate way to convince people of demanding a call for action or is this only another form of "clicktivism", people give the feeling that they provide a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a second?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, more than 19 million 'actions' of supporters have been registered, aimed at a large number of different objectives.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have contributed to the creation of world leaders and policy proposals for more than 37 billion dollars to change life of 2.25 billion people before 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least 10 billion dollars have been paid or brought together by sponsor actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have so far had an impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
This group has promised $35 million of Rwanda to help malnutrition in the country after they had received more than 4.700 twos from Global Citizens, among the main intention statements of the use of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and exporters from the United Kingdom.
"With the help of the British authorities, donors, other national authorities and of Global Citizens as you can make a footnote in history from the social injustice that is under-feeding," said Tracy Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, the public at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions were sent to the British government to improve the food situation for mothers and children, the government announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, that 5 million women and children will reach with food interventions.
In reply to one of the many questions on the website of the Global Citizens, which was asked "What do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The group answered: "It will be a long and difficult way, and we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, just like civil rights and the anti-party movements before us, we will finally be successful because we are together stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will take place this year during the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the marine for a 'block-cade' to hinder the Russian export of energy - Minister of domestic affairs
Washington may take 'if necessary' to the marine to prevent Russian energy coming on the market, including in the Middle East, Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Minister of Indigenous Affairs, as stated by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legal government, is a prerequisite to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that they are only in the Middle East to act in energy, just as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said the report.
And, according to the functioner, there are ways and means to counteract this.
"The United States have that possibility, with the marine, to ensure that the marine routes remain open and, if necessary, to block it to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke for necessaries during an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit targeting, which acts as the 'voting of the energy consumption' in the USA.
He went on and compared Washington's approach to Russia to Iran's approach and noted that this is not essentially different.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is much more or less to use and replace fuels," he said and referred to Russia as a country that knows only a 'arty', with a economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Government of Trump tries to encourage the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, a country that offers the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, Ministers of the Government of Trump, including President Donald Trump itself, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the 'inappropriate' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to the Trum of Berlin, made the 'detention' of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2-pipe line, at the value of 11 billion dollars, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project is only sent by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the idea that energy should not be used to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers" said Alexandr Novak, the Russian Minister for Energy, after meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. energy minister, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has attracted a response from Germany, which has confirmed its involvement in the project again.
The Federal Association of the Deutsche Industries (BDI), the leading industrial organization in Germany, called the USA to avoid interfering with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a major problem when a third power is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of the German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German cancelier Angela Merkel and the Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren' thinks seriously about it' to participate in the presidential elections in 2020, says the Massachusetts Senator
Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, said Saturday that she would think 'nervous about it' to participate in the presidential elections after the interim elections.
During a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she considers it to participate in the elections.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also involves that a woman in the top position," she said, according to the political newspaper The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'm going to think seriously about it to make myself preferable as President."
Warren runs against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall and said he "sends this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm disturbed to the bone to what Donald Trump brings into our democracy," she said.
Warren was open in her criticism to Trump and at Board Kavanaugh, his candidate to the Court of Justice.
In a second on Friday, Warren said "naturally, we must wait for an investigation from the FBI before we vote on it".
However, a opinion study published on Thursday revealed that a majority of Warren's own appendix believes that it should not be preferable in 2020.
In Massachusetts, eightfive percent of the "probable" voters said that the senator had to not be preferable, according to an opinion from the Political Research Center of the Suffolk University and Boston Globe.
Twenty percent did suggest that she would be preferable.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% before possible candidatery and 48%.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, senator from Vermont.
Biden said that he would officially take a decision in January, according to a report from the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin PTSS at a Donald Trump election meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after taking service in September.
He has been arrested and accused Monday night after a mention of domestic violence.
"For what my own son has to deal with, what he's doing now he's back, I have understanding for other families who experience the consequences of PTSS and the injuries with which some of our soldiers return," she told the public that was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrestation "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little different, they come back and become harder, they come back and wonder whether there is respect for what their fellow-soldates and pilots and all other militarys have given for the country of the father.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and has been accused for domestic violence and attack on a woman, infringement in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, Police Wizard in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 States support protest against a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support legal protest against a new US policy which rejects asylum to victims who are on the flight to violence of gangs or to domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and Washington D.C. have submitted a statement to the Washington Court of Justice to support an asylum seeker who fights this policy last Friday as ‘friend-of-the-hof’, reporting NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the case of Grace versus sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union in August has not been published against federal policy.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her, but that American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She's imprisoned in Texas.
The lawyers of the States who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people originate from asylum applications in the USA, as countries who know great problems in the area of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has returned a decision from the Board of Immigrant Appeals from 2014, in which it was possible for immigrants without documents on the flight for domestic violence to demand asylum.
Karl Racine, the procureur-General of Washington D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "dozens of years ignore state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications are assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contradicted with that principle" in the statement of the 'friend-of-the-hof'.
The lawyers also argue that the policy which dismisses immigrants' access to the USA, damages the US economy, because these immigrants are probably new entrepreneurs and the country 'foreseeing the necessary labour forces'.
Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, has commissioned judges to no more asylum asylum to victims of domestic and bound violence.
"Asylum is available for those who flee from their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political belief", said Sessions in its announcement on 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to illuminate all problems, even if these problems are serious, with people every day, everywhere in the world.
Losing rescue efforts in Palu while the number of dead doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation also became worse.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while she tried to comfort her fevery baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is shears."
Inhabitors returned to their devastated homes and searched for valuable things they could still use in their doors.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals are overpowered, so far as they are not damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the scale of Judges.
Some wounds, including Dwi Haris who had risen a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of heavy wets.
Tranen filled his eyes when he told his feelings when the devastating earthquake shaked the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was printed against the rest of a wall," said Haris to a correspondent of the Associated Press and added to this when he was with his family in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, and later I heard nothing more.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe."
Ambassador of US accuses China of 'inimidation' with 'propaganda advertencies'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper held an ad of four pages in an American daily newspaper, in which the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China were represented, the U.S. Ambassador in China Peking accused the use of the American press to distribute propaganda.
American President Donald Trump recently referred to the paid Annex of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interference in the American convention elections of 6 November, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere with the US elections, marked, according to American officers quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to push China.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to place adverts to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have made each other increased import rates.
China’s remuneration rates were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in countries like Iowa, which support the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador in China and earlier a long-term governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had taken American workers, farmers and companies.
"China", as Branstad wrote in an opinion in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "doubles now the intimidation by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses the freedom of expression and a free press, a long-coated tradition in America by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register" wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, you will find with a kiosk in the center of Beijing in vain, and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese population may have about the difficult economic traject, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article," when he did not tell what newspaper this was.
By the Kavanaugh debacle, the Republicans refrigerated female voters just before the interim elections, warn analists
Now many important Republics are around board Kavanaugh, the candidate to the Court of First Instance, and defend him against various claims of sexual violence, warning analists that they will suffer a defeat, especially among women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions around this subject have been enormous and most Republicans have already told them that they want to continue with the vote.
"These things can't be turned back," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syrcuse University, to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he wonders whether the attempt of senator Jeff Flake (Republikein, Arizona) to present a FBI research at the last time will be sufficient to please the bosse voters.
"Whiles are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they have not forgotten it tomorrow and they have not forgotten it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn Friday according to the newspaper from Washington, D.C..
On Friday morning, democrats called "November!" during their demonstration in the Senate hall, while the Republicans who have checked the Justice Committee to approve the candidatery of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analist, to the news site.
"Those say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can continue to happen, especially among female voters in the outer neighborhood and among younger voters, from 18 to 29 years, which often do not even agree with the President."
Even for the public testimony of Ford, in which she further explained its accusation of sexual intimidation against the candidate to the Court of First Instance, analists suggested that if the Republicans would persist the appointment, it could follow a rejection.
"This has become a confused disappointment for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican Party, before week ago, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote in the committee, or about the final vote or that Kavanaugh takes place in the court, but it is also about the way the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it" Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps democrats to be chosen clearly to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be divided about the question they believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority significant for the side of the latter.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents surely or probably believe the testimony of Ford and that 35 percent surely or likely believes Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that she thought that Kavanaugh was sure or likely lying during his testimony while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI is currently involved in examining Ford's accusations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford has stated in ede last week for the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh has touched her under influence of drink when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Court of First Instance had shown his genitals to her during a festival in the time that they studied both in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plant a new internet to address Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a launch that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology-legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the possibility to choose where their data are stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, joke Berners-Lee that 'world rule' is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historical moment."
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
This allows lists of contact persons, activity lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools to be stored.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it depends completely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this 'personal empowerment through data'.
According to the CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides resources, processes and necessary skills to make Solid available for everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week, developers of technology around the world can make their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to talk with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that put all their business models in one time fully on their heads".
"We don't ask for their consent."
In a post on Saturday published, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem that helps protect integrity and quality of the new web, built on Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on netneutrality.
Also after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incrediblely optimistic about this new era of the web" added Berners-Lee to this.
Bernard Vann: Honored in the Victoria Cross of WO I
The only clergy of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I as Military is honored 100 years later in its birthplace.
Lieutenant-Colonel, the honorable Bernard Vann, obtained the distinction as a result of the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sharp shoe, so he never knew that he was part of the highest British military honor.
One anniversary stone was revealed by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was 'briljant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his bataljon on September 29, 1918 on the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense miss and under heavy fire of field-written and machinery."
He went through to the fireline later and led the line forward before he only ran to a field shot and turned out three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sharp shoe on October 4, 1918, something more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something, of which I know I can never tippen it, but also something I feel humbly."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a crane after the parade being led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt "his very devoted to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero shows from the support he received from a large number of people".
Fans from MMA stayed all night to see Bellator 206 and received Peppa Pig in place
Imagine, you stayed awake all night to watch a follow-up Bellator 206 and you won't see the main moment.
On the postal book of San Jose, 13 fights were mentioned, including six in the main section, and this was sent out all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just at the time that Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fights, viewers in the United Kingdom were unpleasantly surprised when the sender switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignated because they were specially awake for this fight all night.
One of them described the transition to the child program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to the government's regulation, after 6:00 a.m., no more content should be displayed that is not suitable for children, and therefore we had to switch to the child programme", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
"Peppa did vary," yess."
Scott Coker, Vice-President of Bellator, said that they will adapt their programming to ensure that the watchers in the United Kingdom will also get a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the return, that we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, there were many sms-you and again and believe me, these weren't all even kind.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a public problem.
I can promise that this will not happen secondly.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual nature
The Olimpian cleansing jumper Tom Daley says he felt inferior because of his sexual nature, but this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 40-year-old said he was until he went to continual education didn't realize that 'not everyone is like I'm'.
In a conversation with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about gay rights to give others 'hop'.
He also said that parent had contributed to the less value of gaining during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show has taken a few months free because of disease.
Apparently as a double to the first Laverne programme, Daley told him that during his youth he felt 'minder' than others because it was "socially not accepted to like both girls and boys."
He said: "To this day these feelings are, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, real facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was 'one' so that he wouldn't disappoint people if they finally come behind his nature.
The winner of two bronzes of Olympic medals has become a remarkable campaign leader for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Community's community games in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he talked because he was happy to see him that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others 'hope'.
The three-time World Championshiper said that he was in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, who he met in 2013, has "may betrayed me completely".
Daley married last year with the Oscarwinnaar, who is 20 years older than he, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you have to survive so young," he participated in his first Olympic Games at 14 years of age and his father died three years later of cancer, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who had experienced the same height and low points.
The couple had become parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "hele perspective" was changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I had answered that it all turned to win a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning golden Olympic medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at a age of 40, after he had received the diagnosis brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted his death and one of the last things he had asked if she had already received the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't get about my heart to say, you won't be there anymore to sit on the first row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breath was actually stolen and he died, I could finally recognize that he wasn't insurmountable," he said.
The following year Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won sources.
"I knew I had dreamed all of my life about this. To dive for a home publication during the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first music choice, Proud by Heather Small, that he had strongly attacked him on the way to play and where he still got chicken from.
Desert Island Discs is listening on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not formed, on bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he must see his form back to make no sad milestone.
Mickelson, who participates in the two-year event, a record, was placed on the bank by the team captain Jim Furich for the four balls and four-some on Saturday.
Instead of standing in the centre of action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and training on the driving range, in an attempt to find out where it is suspended.
Because he was never known even on the top of his career for his right drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs flocking balls royalously.
And if the job is not terrible enough on itself, Mickelson comes in the nineth match on Sunday the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against that is linked to newling Tommy Fleetwood to win all four the matches this week.
If the Americans who are behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single matches, start well, the match of Mickelson can be absolutely crucial.
Furich has proved to have trust in this man, even though he could be honestly speaking differently.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a knock on the back, struck his arm around me and said he was ready tomorrow," said Furich.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's included in the Hall of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play only two matches.
I expected more, but it's like it is and it's the way we think we should act.
He wants to be with it, just like all others."
Mickelson can improve the record of Nick Faldo for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career, in which he has never just elevated the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson won 18 matchs, 20 lost matches and 7 are the same games on his name, but Furich said that his presence had a certain uncomfortable influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's taken, he likes to get grapes out with people and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to keep him off and then also for the crazy last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game."
Thomas Bjorn, Chief of the European team, knows that large advance can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows out of experience that the comfortable pre-experience of the single match on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Dans made his debut in the competition in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with the captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point jump on the Americans, but finally the finish line passed with the least possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You continue to remind yourself that we had a great jump in Valderram; we had a great jump in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, called here, after seeing the 2018 lighting with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for award of 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and all others in the team that this isn't a game played yet.
Everyone will have to take full action tomorrow.
Go on the battle and carry the plan on the right.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's what this trophe wins, and there we must keep focusing on it.
I continue to say, I'm focusing on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people who are on the other hand, some of the best players in the world."
Rejoiced about the performances of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead in this area.
Tomorrow's waiting for a new challenge.
Tomorrow the individual performances come on, and that's another discipline.
It's great to get out there with a partner when it's good, but when you're only standing for it, your capabilities as a golfer are just really tested.
That's the message you need to tell the players try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So let your partner go now and he must get the best out of himself."
In contrast to Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to do better than partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Furyk itself has experience with both sides of this kind of turnover on the last day, as a member of the win-up team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Mirakel of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that talk," he answered in reply to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had spectred his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the top tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brookline, or as in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there's a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We voted on our line up and send the men on the way in the order that is the best of us and, you know, we're gonna try to get something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead to the counter-off and put Rory McIlroy into the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I chose this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany re-established
The latest freight of the German marine should have come into service in 2014, to replace the elderly warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will last at least one year before it is ready, due to defect systems and ongoing costs, reported local media.
The company of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the global new Baden-Wuerttemberg fregattes, is now exposed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper The Time that quotes a military spoken.
The vessel should have been part of the marine in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have plowed the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the marine has ordered in 2007 are used to replace the elderly freights of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful canon, a series of air-defence and anti-speedrakets and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic features.
Other important characteristics are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to set up the latest freights up to two years, far away from home ports.
However, the continual delays mean that the advanced warships, intended to give Germany the possibility to project his power overseas, have already elapsed by the time they are taken into business, notes that time.
Last year, the fatal fregat F125 has taken newspaper heads, when the German marine officially refused to put the vessel into business and return to the shipyard Blom & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of key 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it would be used in a fight mission.
Software defects were especially important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuertteberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the freights of the older Bremen class.
It was also clear that the ship has a serious overweight, which will reduce the performance and limit the marine opportunities to perform further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defected hardware, the price card for the complete project, including the training of the crew, is already a problem.
It is said that this has reached a dizzling €3.1 billion compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems of the latest freights in their grip will be extra important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German marine decreases.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defence committee in Germany, recognised that the marine has "a shortage of inzetable ships".
The functioner said that the problem has grown over time as a snowball, because old ships were taken out of company but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the fregats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were available to be included in the marine.
National trust listens to the secret life of flying mice
New research conducted on a estate in the Scottish high-country countries is trying to reveal the use of feathers of the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will shine new light on the behavior of these unique flying animals and will contribute to future preservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland follows the ordinary and small dwergfleermuis, the brain large-oreflermuis and the water-fliesmuis at Invereve Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed on key locations around the estate to follow the activities of the flymuis through the season.
Workers of the NTS and volunteers are also going to carry out mobile studies with the help of hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of the wing mushrooms and what kind of thing does.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be produced in order to make such a detailed picture of their behavioural scale.
Rob Dewar, Natural Protection Adviser of the NTS, hopes that the results show which habitat areas are the most important to wing mice and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making pasture fields and how we can maintain forests best for flying music and similar species.
Vlermuis populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have been significantly reduced in the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities affecting sleeping sites and the loss of habitat.
Windturbines and bliksems can also pose risks, such as flying capers and certain chemical treatments of construction materials and attacks by household cats.
Vlermuizes are in fact not blind.
However, their ears are more useful by their night hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76.000 hectares in the country, is taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, regularly studying, inspections of sleeping sites and sometimes perform rescue actions.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for flying mice in Scotland at the landgoed Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of flying music of Scotland lives.
Landscape manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal area for the wing musicians.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for flying music," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much about vleermuis yet not known, so the work we are doing here and in other locations will help us to understand what they need to steal."
He stresses the importance of control of feathers before maintenance activities are carried out, because the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping site may lead to the death of 400 female fliesmuizes and their boys, allowing a complete local population to be eradicated.
Vlermuizes are a protected animal species and it is illegal to kill, fall down or store them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Schott's funeral for the Bat Conservation Trust, asked the public to contribute to help.
She said: "We still need to learn a lot about our flying mice and many of our species, we just don't know how to do with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects accuses of attack while his lawyers prepare to persecut a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo's accusations of attack qualified as 'fake news' and said that people want to promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about complaining the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the accusations have been published.
The top of Portugal and Juventus is accused of the attack of a American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $ 375.000 to swear about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Through a video for its 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33 hours after the accusations were reported, the reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the box.
I'm a lucky man, and through and through well" added the footballer to this, smileing.
The lawyers of Ronaldo prepare a case of law in which they want to pursue Der Spiegel for the accusations they called 'a inevitable report of suspicions in the area of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for the 'morel damage for a amount that corresponds to the seriousness of infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident has been reported in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga according to the report went back to the room of the footballer, where he raped her according to the accusation anal, as read in the complaint submitted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a 'good guy' for '99 percent', but that he is sometimes left that 'one percent'.
The documents suggest that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was mutually approved.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that there have been photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an external law arrangement because she was "bang for the consequences" and because she worried about the 'publical humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says that it wants to make the scheme invalid because it is permanently traumatized by the avoiding incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and this summer went to the Italian yigant Juventus into a deal at the value of €100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will have eternal regrets' as autoproducers leave
The United Kingdom 'will have an eternal regret,' if it loses its status as world leader in the field of autoproduction after Brexit, said Greg Clark, minister of Economic Affairs.
He added to this, the 'safe' that Toyota UK had said to the BBC that if Great Britain would leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily suspend production in the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car producer said that the impact of delays at the border would be cost in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit' jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota are made, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to other European Union countries.
"My vision is that when Great Britain crashes from the EU at the end of March, we will see the production in our factory silence," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also made their fears about the consequences of a EU departure without agreement for the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already told us that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most concerns the car producers are about risks in supply chains in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
The production line of Toyota is based on the 'just-in-time' principle, where every 37 minutes of suppliers arrive in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be disruption of the limits that could lead to delays and shortcomings of components according to industry.
Toyota cannot store stocks more than one day in Derbyshire factory, so the company knew, so in such a case the production would be discarded.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers Plan for the future relationship with the EU 'exact has been agreed to avoid those controls at borders'.
"We must have a deal. We want the best deal, which will enable us not only to continue the current success, but also to take this chance," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must absolutely continue with this very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but at the longer time it warned that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is representative of the trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these jobs have lost, they never come back again.
A public spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein's experience can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and the Adjunct Procureur General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed a week later' while the fight on the candidate for the Supreme Court, Board Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, which researchs about the Russian influence of elections, links between Trump and Russia's wizards and possible barriers to law by the President.
The question whether Trump will dismiss the Adjunct-Procureur-General and thus pose the independence of Mueller, the Washington Roddel Machine has been launching months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying out a microphone to lay down conversations with Trump and to detach the President through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, the round was that he was about to serve his dismissal.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that he wanted to dismiss Rosenstein 'liever', but when the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual improperity, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would be witnessing both.
On Friday, Trump gave the FBI orders to carry out an investigation from one week to the accusations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote in the full Senate.
On Sunday Sarah Sanders, the press director of Trump on Fox News.
Asked for the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "There is not yet a date for determining, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed a week, given all other things that are going to the Court of Justice.
But we will see, and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters had difficulty with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scarce to press conferences was not caused by a remedy of the 'founding' TV journalists, although, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to draw attention."
Then she suggested that immediate contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President is doing more questions and answer sessions than any president to him," she said, without giving evidence to this, "We have viewed the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, this is quite much better than to talk to me.
We try to do so much, and you have often seen us do this in recent weeks, and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with dignitars visiting.
Press conferences with only the President are rare.
In New York this week, the president was able to demonstrate why, he made a open and bizarre phenomenon for the collected reporters.
Minister for Healthal Care writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland workers from other EU countries
The Minister for Health wrote a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and the wish to continue working at the NHS after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already declared its willingness to carry the costs of applying a fixed status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In its letter, Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued during the summer, and this autumn will take the expected decisions.
At the same time, the authorities of the UK also set up preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is achieved.
I know this must be uncertain times for you all.
That is why I would like to emphasize what I appreciate the contribution of all the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Collega's from all over the EU and outside bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and provide benefits for the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is firm and sure you're home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Butcrombie undergoes a speed operation after main injury
The line baker of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, went yesterday a speed operation after he had expired a headlet in the match lost 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of the Tennessean reported.
Rod Reed, the Chief Coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident was short for rest.
"He came to the sideline and took a little or more in it" said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the sideline before they put him on a stretcher and took him for further research.
A officer of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie came from the operational room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are no details about the type/ size of the injury and Tennessee State at any time when the injury occurred.
Butcrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer of Illinois.
He was totally fif times on Saturday before he left the field, so he has been attacked this season in a total of 18 times.

This action is regarded as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn that attracts young voters with promises to ensure more affordable homes and this to report on many ministers.
The increase in lumps is raised to persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional yields in an attempt by the government to combat rooflessness.
The rate, which comes above the current legends, including the higher levels which have been introduced two years ago for second homes and homes purchased for the rental, can be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to £ 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new construction in London is purchased by those who do not live in the UK, and that the prices are raised and it is difficult for launchers to get a foot on the house.
Many prospering territories in the country, especially in the capital, have become practical "spooksteden" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had pleaded for a reduction in the emptys to help young people buy their first house.
He accused large construction firms to keep the prices high by buying land and not using it and called for May to retain quotas on affordable homes in order to restore the 'sustainment change' in Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced a distinctive series of housing reforms, including hire ceilings and an end to suspension 'without challenge'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new homes.
May said, "Last year I said I wanted to spend my time as first minister in restoring the 'British Dream', that life becomes better for every new generation.
And that means that our defect dwelling market must be restored.
Great Britain will always be open for people who want to live here, work and build a life.
However, it can not be so easy for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies to buy homes as it is for the hardworking British people.
For too many people, the dream has ever become an too vague dream and has been the humiliation of life without a roof above the head already too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambitions are the management of Scotland'
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it's his 'lty ambitions' to ever become manager of Scotland.
The Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of re-establishing the club from the northeast of England, currently at the third place in League One, in three points of the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after he had returned to the Scottish Prime Ministership the previous season of St Mirren.
"As soccer, I wanted to play before my homeland.
But I was selected for the B team and with that the pope was off," Ross told Sportssound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child I saw with my father Scotland often playing in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps touching me.
However, that possibility would only come if I were successful in the management of a club."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says that he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, before he had rejected avances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is measured at this moment by "I can let this club return to the Premier League?"
Due to the structure and facilities at this club, this must certainly be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to reach this, but I can only see myself as successful if I bring the club back there."
Ross is just three years in his career as a manager, after a period as a assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to restore from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from the edge of degradation to win the Championship during the next season.
And Ross says that he feels more comfortable than ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably really a point of crossing," he reminded himself of the moment when he took over the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that the management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizar, because I did best okay, I deserved quite well and have known some reasonable highlights.
But soccer balls can be heavy.
There's a lot of things you're faced every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the business, but management just feels good.
I always want to be a manager and now I'm real, I'm so good in my skin, as I never felt in my mature life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on Saturday, reveals research
The summer heat wave has made the income increase of British pubs that have been able to survive but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw the turnover increase by 2.7% in July, but the incomes in restaurants were 4.8% less, show the figures.
Peter Martin, from the business consulting office CGA, who collected the figures, said: "According sunshine and the fact that England was longer than expected to participate in the world championships, meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had 2.8 percent more turnover, with that difference that the restaurants had become even harder now.
The fall of 1,8 percent in the turnover of restaurants in June, only in July was worse.
Pubs and bars that are focused on drink sales services far out of the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also addressed on the sale of food members of the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurants.
It seems that people just went on to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, drink sales were 6.6% higher for the month, while food sales was 3% lower."
Paul Newman van RSM, analysers for the free-time and hospitality industry, said: "This results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social or sporting events remain the largest factors for turnover in the outer market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to fight, even though a turnover of 4.8 percent year on year is particularly painful given the constant cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could have come for the operators who did not focus on food at a worse time and only the time will learn whether the more moderate temperatures of August could give the necessary respiratory."
The total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, which reflects the decrease of the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the turnover monitor for the public, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data are collected and analyzed from 47 operational groups, with a joint turnover of £ 9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the branch.
One on the five children has a secret account for social media, which they keep hidden for their parents
One on the five children, some not older than 11 years, has a secret account for social media, which they keep hidden for parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Inquiry among 20.000 students of secondary schools revealed growth in 'valse Insta pages'
This news has strengthened the fear of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of the pupils say to have a 'home account' that they also show their parents
One on the five children, some not older than 11 years, makes accounts for social media they keep hidden for adults.
A survey of 200,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid growth in the 'valse Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for the sharing of photos.
This news has strengthened the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students say that they use a clean "head account" that they show to their parents while also have personal accounts.
A mother who was right at the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who asked others to 'move her.
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference) of independent schools discovered that 40 percent of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half would follow personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are attracted to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voting of the athleet' in the Scottish advisory for the athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been chosen to the board of the Scottish athletic world, as a non-exporting director at the general annual meeting of the administrative body.
Doyle is the most decorated athletes in Scotland at the job and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great chance for the sport drivers to learn about her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the atletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from her election in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am happy to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can give a contribution and can help to govern sports in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and 400 meters during the 1996 games in Atlanta, two of its four golden Olympics, and who now regularly commented on the BBC, could not walk anymore after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only the time will learn whether I will recover and in what extent.
It's been terrible hard work, but I've been completely restored, I have learned again and again to do my flexibility practices today!
Thank you for all the aid tests!"
Advertisement for breast pump in which mothers are compared with cows divides online opinion
A company making breast pumps has distributed the online opinion with an ad in which so-called mothers are compared to cows that are melted.
In order to mark the introduction of what is called 'the most silent tragable breast pump in the world', Elvie, producer of consumer technology, has issued an ironic, inspired advertisement on music videos to illustrate the freedom to offer this new pump to collective mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hip-filled shoe on a song that contains texts like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see it,' and 'In the case you haven't had it, this are no uers, this are my breasts'.
The refree continues with: 'Pumpen, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's.
However, the ad, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, has directly provided for an online controvers.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has attracted hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that in this the 'horror' of the dairy industry is promised.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
As we do, they must be expected and taken to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days after the devaluation is written in an response.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreet in a nutrient (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else said: "This is of course traumatic for mother and baby.
But, yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another other one added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilarisch'.
"I think this is a generic idea.
I'd be able to create a borrowing if I still had breastfeed.
Those pumps gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I didn't even get too much behind it.
This is a generic product," someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a funny advertisement, focused on mammas that cows (frequently on the workplace or in a toilet) and then the feeling of being just "cows".
This ad cannot be positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you see the group of women who are all on dancing with the pump discreet hidden in their pleasures.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who colvae feel simply cows at times.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, does not have drains or snakes and fits discreet in a nutritional possession, so that women have freedom to move, hold their babies, even go out while they are cows.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that earned a sturdy and provocative introduction.
By comparing the cowarding mothers and milk cows, we wanted to place the coal and the corresponding challenges in the shiners and at the same time show how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump takes the front page.
During the London Fashion Week a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski's catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrants children silently moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of imtinent migrants children has reached a peak, although the number of monthly cross-border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the hard-fighted rhetoric and the hard-feed policy introduced by the Government of Trump makes it more difficult to retain children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to put their own chances to remain in the country by reporting to a child.
This risk has been increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and the other adult members of their household should issue their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared in a testimony for the convention that his organization has arrested tens of people who have reported themselves as sponsor for unmadely minors.
The organisation later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no preliminary penalty.
"By 80 percent of the sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and many of them are criminal strangers.
We're persecuting these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to process children, officials have introduced new rules, so that some of them are obliged to appear before the court within one month after the start of the detention, rather than within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the employees at the shelter
Many of them will stand for the courts through a video conference instead of in person to present their application of a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are not deemed to be eligible for help will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain close, the greater the chance of being anxious or depressive, which may cause violent eruptions or flight efforts, according to the employees in the shelter and by reports coming out of the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are stronger in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is fighting more frequently ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare themselves emotionally here or to say to friends, can contribute to the trauma of many of them.
Syria orders to repeal the US, France and Turkey immediately
In a talk to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid Al-Muallem, has also called on the Syrian refugees to return even now the country's war is in the eighth year.
Mouem, which is also vice-premier, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, to fight terrorism under the premises and that 'this will be handled accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Mouem, the "war unterror is almost over" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been dewortled and driven from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this sacred struggle until we have liberated all Syrian areas" from terreur groups and of a "eventual illegal foreign presence".
The United States have about 2,000 forces in Syria, which are particularly involved in training and advising the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 forces in the country destroyed by war.
As regards refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are beneficial for their return and he refused to distribute 'enkel Western countries irrational fears' so that most refugees remain away.
"We have made a call to the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They politize a case that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there is no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end war.
Diplomats of the United Nations say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last important bolwerk of rebels, has created the possibility to start political conversations.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has aborted a major attack from Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that this agreement knows 'clear deadlines' and said that he was hoping that the military action will focus on jihadists, including fighters of Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which will be 'depleted'.
Staffan de Misura, UN Member, is hoping to meet the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to design a constitution before the war for Syria and to ease the way for elections.
Mouem made clear what the conditions of the Syrian government are to participate in the committee and said that the panel's work should limit 'to review the articles of the current constitution' and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many "liberal" viewers probably hope, his presidentship is prematurely terminated by a deployment procedure and scandals.
In what undoubtedly "the most dramatic final of a presidentship ever" would be.
At present, however, there are no signs of emigration.
Since 2014, looks rates have been more than doubled to 1.05 million during the 'prime time' at CNN and almost dried to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' of MSNBC is at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible one behind the ABC-drama 'Designated Survivor', a series of a minister who will be President after an attack destroyed the Capitool.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her that he would be going to vote to Trump.
She asked.
"He said "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, in contrast to all the other on TV, the story lines coming from Washington may influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can regain or influence the status of the world economy.
Disable is a luxury that only can afford the most private viewers.
And yet, it's going to be more than a well-formed citizen, when you get in mind that you've been looking at a panel expert who discussed the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', who's about the jack of Paul Manafort's jacket that $15,000 has cost (a garment full of overmod' according to The Washington Post) and who discuss the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomie of Trump.
I will never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way.
"What he does to give you the idea that it is a reality show is partly that he stops you every night something new," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the maker of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role division of the Trump show and the daily plot exchanges (a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss a delivery if you have the idea you're running behind.
When I first reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he sat inside watching MSNBC while taking up CNN.
He couldn't loose himself from the screen, with board Kavanaugh, which had to appear for the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court that was at stake.
"I remember that we did all these rare shows, not so long ago, and that people said "this is the beginning of the Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it shows that they were right."

Money from outside flows in the most exciting interim elections for the home of delegates
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees abundance of money, thanks to a recasting of a choosing district which has to fight two seated national representatives to the same seat.
The recently rediscovered district of Pittsburg hit the Democratic National Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired its seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take up against another seated national representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which knows much overlap with the new 17th district.
The cards are re-evided after the Pennsylvania Court held in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally classified ('gerrymandering') in the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a knock party in the field of campaign financing between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a nipth victory in a well viewed special election for the 18th electoral district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican and President Donald Trump for more than ten years with 20 percentage points of difference.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small benefit.
The US considered to punish El Salvador for support to China and have dismissed this
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he enjoyed a hotel in Panama until his partners put off the Trump Organization Management Team.
Ambassadors of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to call back the U.S. Heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore' said Heather Nauert, the minister of State, in a statement earlier this month.
But only punishment was considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million from American aid in 2017, for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with a large unemployment and high murder rates.
While the internal meetings went through, North American and Central American officials set out a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up at a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from moving to the United States.
However, half of September, a number of the government's top officers made known that they wanted the conference to continue and thus made all possible penalty measures against El Salvador impossible.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence talks at the conference, which is now planned for half October, as a sign of the importance of the government's grant to the meeting, say diplomas.
And the three American Messengers have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harassment of penalty measures from Washington.
A spokesman of the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomas, which agreed to discuss the internal debate under anoniemity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analist, which is also close to the government, which also spoke on condition of anoniemity.
Control History
The next step may be the report by the special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counteract of the Trump court, which has now become publicly known by heavy evidence.
Mueller's research is likely to focus on cooperation between the Trump and Russia campaign in an attack of Russia on our elections.
When the Color Congress changes, Trump itself must be responsible for that institution, just as he prepares to rely on the voters, and maybe he has to be responsible for a jury in a court.
That is a lot of hope, and I do not want to suggest that the drop of Trump is inevitable or that of its equivalents in Europe.
There will have to be choices made by us all, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine how long the fight will take place.
In 1938 German officers were ready to perform a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only when the West had commanded resistance and Czechoslovakia had supported in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to prevent the years of blood sheds, followed by them.
The course of history runs around such points and the unbidden opmars of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently faced with various of this kind of curves.
What will we do if Trump dismisss adjunct-procureur-General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of the Mueller's research?
Rosenstein is in a difficult position since the moment when this magazine reported that he had, last year, preferred to take conversations with the president in secret and that he had specialised on the appropriateness of the president for his office.
Rosenstein says that The Times' report is not inappropriate.
"How will we react if the newly requested research from the FBI to Board is not complete or not honest, or if he is appointed in the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of attack and a dishonest witness?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that Trump will call for account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy waits for a very long winter.
But I believe we won't fail by the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jews who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever occupied my ambassador home.
She survived it, immigrated to America and sent me, 60 years later, to attack cigarettes before the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika was represented.
With that as my inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race against Rapid Vienna
Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday visit and know that after the impressive equality in Spain against Villarreal, a victory on the Austrians is held in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europe League.
Due to a kneeblessure, the center of Graham Dorrans could not play his first season game until the 2-2 game at Villarreal, but he believes that the ranters who could use out as a spring plan for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good 11-year-old," said 31-year-old.
"We entered the game with the idea that something was to win, and the game came out with a point.
Maybe we could even have win at the end, but throughout the whole game a game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Come on Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully, we can get three points, but it's going to be a burdeny game because they also had a good result in their last game, but if the public is behind us, I'm sure we can press through and have a positive result.
Last year has certainly been heavy, of all that happened to my blessures and the changes in the club itself, but now there's a feeling-good factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it, the training is good.
Hopefully, we can now press through, leave the last season behind us and become again successful."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of their pension
Despite the fact that participants in the survey had a clear idea of the way they want to take care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in national research said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they talked to their children about this.
"Mensen wants a family member to provide for them, but they do not take the steps necessary to take this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president for life insurance at Nationwide.
Let's start here.
Talk to your Echtgeno (o)t(e) and the children: You can't prepare your family for care if you don't make your wishes well known at time.
Work together with your adviser and your family to discuss where and how to get care, because these choices may be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial adviser in the arm: Your adviser can also give you advice on the way you can pay these expenditure.
Your long-term financing choices may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenditure, or make their own capacity as insurance as long as you have money.
Imagine legal documents: Avoid legal fight when the insurance is to be instituted.
Make sure of a complete health care, so that you can appoint a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals keep your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider also a complete power for your financial business.
In that case, you select a trusted person to take on behalf of your financial decisions and to ensure that the invoices are paid if you can't get this anymore.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother hits a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies in that case?
Put these details in a written plan so you can have the information.
"It's not just the financial matters that are of interest, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who cares for the dog?
Make sure that plan is coming."
You're several times shot with air pressure weather in Ilfracombe
A man is several times shot with a air pressure gun when he walked home after a night.
The victim, 40 plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was touched in his breast, belly and hand.
Agents described the damnation, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'random act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life threatening, and the police called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that has hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said officers, and the expectation is that the death number will rise further.
As the communications equipment are disabled, the official authorities have not yet received any information from the rainy Donggala, a area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicentric centre, with a force of 7.5 on the scale of Judges.
In Palu more than 6,000 people have been eliminated after the disaster has occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes province and lies at the end of a small bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city fourth his 40th anniversary when the tsunami entered.
Donggala is a rainline stretching over 300 km away from the coast of northwest Celebes.
The rainship, a administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the Central Celebes province economy, in particular in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nikel mines are also important in the province, but most of them are in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly affected over the past hundred years by tsunamis, according to the Agency for the fight against Indonesia's disasters.
In 1938 a tsunami demanded over 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami went to the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine dead.
Indonesia is located on the Haddingtonn Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of the heavyest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ajeh on north of Sumatra on December 26, providing a tsunami that has hit 14 countries and in total demanded 22,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Ajeh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, to the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with a force of 6.8 on the scale of Judges found place south of Java, the most closely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami who had the southern coast and demanded almost 700 lives.
2009: A earthquake with a force of 7.6 on the scale of Judges trooped the city of Padang, capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: A earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the scale of Judges trooped one of the Mentawai islands, for the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and demanded about 300 human life.

Federal prosecutors require a rare death penalty for suspect of terreur attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York require the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terreur attack in New York City, in which eight persons have been killed, a rare punishment that has not been carried out since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry a attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he traveled footgangers and bicycles on his road in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov has killed the eight victims and has seriously given serious physical injury, according to the intention declaration in which the death penalty is demanded in the Southern District of New York.
For both complaints, the death penalty is possible, in accordance with the document submitted to the Court.
Weken after the attack, a federal grand jury adopted the delegation with 22 prosecutions, including eight attacks on murder for a racket, typically a complaint used by federal prosecutors against organised crime, and a attack on violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as 'great, cruel and diluted'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevitsj Sajpov has damaged, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and crofter Damian Pagnuccico" is a statement of intention.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been more than ten years ago that in the Southern district of New York, a case in which the death penalty was demanded.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was condemned for the murder of two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to lifelong prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was exported in a federal case in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after two years earlier sentenced for spionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, originating from Uzbekistan, did not demonstrate wrath in the days and months after the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He let the researchers know that he felt well about his act, she was the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after viewing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the complaint.
He also asked to hang up the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, told the police.
He did not claim to be guilty of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defendants representing Sajpov, said he was "natural disappointed" with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We think that the decision to require death penalty instead of accepting a guilt in exchange for a lifelong prison without possibility of unreliability, will only extend the trauma of these events for all involved." Patton said.
The defense of Sajpov had previously asked the prosecutors not to require death penalty.
Conservative parliamentary member states that NIGEL FARAGE should lead to the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilise a "volksleger" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians should feel the 'hitte' of the Eurosceptici, while one of the own members of Theresa May proposed to give him the lead of the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants to the mars in Birmingham that the UK would be "already" if Mr Farage Brexit minister was.
However, the challenge for which May is put in reconciliation of the strongly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives pro-Remain and participating in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on the ride while this is attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Medests persisted that she will continue and will try to close a deal with Brussels despite the counterfeits and thus force Eurosceptici and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to throw 'Chequers in the pink basket'.
He suggested that Farage should be harassed and the responsibility should be given for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he made the service, we'd be out of it now," Bone said.
The Wellingborough parliamentary member added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers into the robbery basket."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fighted in two world wars to be underlying.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone suggested that public opinion has been changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British population has been changed and wished to remain in the EU is totally untrue."
The Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the mars and told reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chequers is unpopulary to the great public, the opposition does not vote, it is unpopulous within our party and our activists who go from door to door and ensure that we are chosen.
Let Chequers fall and listen."
In a direct May message, she added: "Premiers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the 'hite' if they wanted to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is a matter of confidence between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They try to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "we don't let you come away here."
In a message to the enthusiastic mass, he added: "I want you to betray the fire to our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilise the national army of this country that has worried us in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, Remainers marched by Birmingham and closed this mars with a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists swallowed with flags on which Tories stood against Brexit after the establishment of this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, member of the Labour higher house, made grapes about the security problems of a conservative app from the Conservatives at the beginning of their conference.
"This is the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for the unreliable border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a full farce.
There's not something like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plant 'going to think good' on Presidential candidateship
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll be going to think about her presidential candidateship after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts told her future at a meeting in a town hall in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-selected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republicans Member of the Member of the Trim campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She had been the center of speculations that she may have been struggling with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
A present woman asked her if she would prefer to presidency.
Warren answers that it becomes time "for women to go to Washington to restore our defect government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrestation after death of Wayde Sims van LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the killing of Wayde Sims, basketball player of LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20.
They gave a video free of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of the Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot wound in the head and has died on its consequences," said police commander Murphy J. Paul to the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been inquired and has been known at the place of delict to have been in possession of a fire weapon and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson is arrested without further incidents and is held in closeness at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a Juneor player of 1,98 meters who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started the last season in 10 games. He had an average of 17,4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approachs world title after Sebastian Vettel left him after orders of team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the team orders of Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and was almost entirely in the cold when he defended his position and Vettel invited to attack his teammate.
Fattel went into the pits and left Hamilton in the pressured drives in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went a round later into the pits and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back to head after a wheel-on wheel action to release the Ferrari rider with counterfeiting space on the inside after a double movement in the third bow.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was a long leader of the race, because he stayed at his choosing and mixed fast finishing, so that he could pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, in the 44th round, he went to the pits, to he couldn't increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri made his best all weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me over.
The team has done its best for the places one and two," Hamilton said.
That was not a good body language.
President Donald Trump persuaded Senator Dianne Finstein during a election meeting on Saturday on the fact that she did not complete the source of the selected letter of Christine Blásey Ford, in which the candidate was accused for the Court of Justice, Board Kavanaugh, was accused of attack.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly talk about the testimony given by Ford for the Senate Justice Committee; instead, he showed that what took place in the Senate showed that people could be "gemeen, unqualified and unreasonable"."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the Senate in the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and common and uncertain and common," he said.
"When you look at the permessages and the leaks and then they say "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Finstein, did you select?
You know her answer... you selected the document - oh, oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't select.'
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't select," he added, in a senator imitation.
In July, the letter in which the accusations to the address of Kavanaugh were mentioned were sent to Finstein by Ford and was selected in September, but Finstein denied that her office was the leak.
"I didn't keep Dr. Ford's accusations hidden, I didn't select her story," said Finstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go confidentially, and I treated it confidentially as she had asked."
But the president did not seem to believe her denial and he commented during the Saturday evening meeting: "I'll tell you what that was not a good body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In addition to the defense of the candidate to the Court of First Instance, accused by three women of sexual immigration, the President suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take the power back, with all necessary means.
You see the commonity, the inequality, they don't give anything to whom they hurt, who they have to drive to grab the power and get the control back," said the president, according to a Mediaite report.

Air traffic leaders die, while ensuring that hundreds of people can escape the earthquake in a plane
A air traffic leader in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people could get safely on board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a heavy earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Powerful nakeds are still harassing the area and many are buried under the point of the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Appoint refused to leave his post in the wild and weather moving traffic stores of the Mudiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was ready at the startway, could get safe.
Then he was sprinkled out of the traffic stores when he thought it was on crashing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News from Australia reported.
We had a helicopter regularly from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter had reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart, when you hear it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities feared that the number of deaths can rise to thousands and made the Agency aware of the fight against disasters of the country that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"Men assumes that the number of deaths continues to rise because many bodies were under the puin and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the Agency.
Waves reaching a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where they will keep a massive funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial airlines provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought into by ambulances.
Clean water is shark.
The mini-markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is developed in a race to help survivors, but we don't know what they will meet.
This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
President Joko Widode from Indonesia arrived Sunday in Palu and he said to the present militarys: "I appeal to you all to work day and night so that all the tasks needed for evacuation are completed.
Are you ready for it?" CNN reported.
Indonesia has already been affected by earthquakes in Lombok this year, with over 550 people left life.
Air Niugini says that one man is missing after a crash in the lagune
The airline which carried out the flight that was crashed in a Ringtailese lagune in Micronesia now says that another man is missing, after mentioned earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members had left the sunny plane safely.
Air Niugini said in a press report that is missing on Saturday afternoon one male passenger.
The airline said they worked together with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped the rescue of the other passengers and the crew members after the plane was too watered during the landing on the Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities announced Friday that seven people were brought to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What has caused the crash and what is the exact order of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. marine say that the plane has landed in the lagune and the landing door has missed.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has been shot over the landing board.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told him himself and some others succeeded in watching the water that came to their means to the emergency exits of the zincing plane.
He also said that the stewards were panic and screaming and that he had a not serious head wound.
The U.S. marine announced that seales who were at work on a yard also helped the rescue work by bringing people to the coast with a blasphemy boat before the plane further sunshine in the about 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Security Network show that in the past 20 years 111 persons have found death in crashes of air carriers registered at the PNG but that does not relate to Air Niugini.
Analist sets the time line of the night when a woman has been burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisitoir on Friday in the reopening process of a man who is accused of living burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analist of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, presented a few hours of testimony as witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made the jury clear how he had used the call data of mobile phones to determine the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night in which she left life.
Rowlett told that he had received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers at the evening of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford again.
Sanford stood in the witness bank on Saturday and told him he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis spoke the truth when he told him he was at Sanford in his truck during that night, Sanford said he's lying because my truck was at Nashville.
Another conflict was that Tellis told that he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The mobile phone data indicated that they knew each other just one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis knew some time after the death of Chambers the texts, calls and contact data from his phone.
"He knew her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense starts on Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said that he expects the jury to start the next day with the discussions.

A child boy from New York challenges a couple for the judge because of a 'racist' text
A child boyfriend from New York suspects a couple for the judge because of dismission for discriminatory reasons, after having received an incorrectly sent text in which the mother complained about 'receively such a black'.
The couple denies to be racist and calls the case 'persection'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her disposition when she discovered that the new child girl, Giselle Maurice, was a negroid woman when she met her first working day in 2016.
'NEEE WORLD ZO'N ZWARTE', Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a report to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it twice to Mrs Maurice.
According to the American newspaper the New York Post, the Plasco-Flaxman Mrs Maurice said that when she realized her blossom, her previous child boyfriend, who was Afro-American, had been bad work, and therefore she expected a Philippine.
Mrs Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home with a taxi.
Now Maurice has the couple for the court to get a compensation of $ 350,- a day for the 6 months for which she was hired to bicycle internally with the family, although without contract.
"I want to let them feel that you just don't do this," says Maurice added last Friday in the New York Post, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple petitioned with regard to the claim that she was racist by saying that it was reasonable to dismiss Maurice after being insulted by her, feared that they couldn't trust her anymore.
My wife sent her a message she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not a racist," married husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you had insulted, even though it was accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Don't you shoot me?
About the case comparing the case with 'approval', Plasco said that his wife expected a baby over two months and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
"Do you want to persecut such a person?
That is not so sympathic," the investment banker added.
While the case is still running, the public opinion is quick to challenge the couple on social media, where it is handled for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking bear, reveals newly raised letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: "It is difficult to get in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time, still before the first publication.
With what we now know about the enormous success of Paddington, it's very surprising.'
She told her father who, before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy beer, worked as a cameraman at the British sender BBC, was optimistic about or his book. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book 'bitter sweet' felt last year after his death.
About Paddington, which she describes as a "a very prominent member of the family", she told her father was secretly proud of the final success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so lively for him, it seemed almost a performance of a child; you are proud as you did nothing for it.
I think he had so much the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own performance, he cherished the bear itself for success."
My daughter was dying and I had to tell her by phone.
Soon after the landing, her daughter was brought to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life for no time.
"Nad had called several times to say that it was very bad and that it was expected that she would not get it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"The phone of Nad came to say she'd die within two minutes and I had to take a divorce from her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love your treasure.
We're soon together.
Then I'll be with you again.
The medicines that the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly developed and lost her body.
She died for some time, and this process went off all the way.
I could just stay there, knowing what all got out.
I couldn't sad, cry or cry, because I was in the middle of all sorts of people and families.
I had to keep myself great."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning about the death of her daughter, walked in the plane with the other passengers who had no idea what trial she had to deal with.
"Nobody knew it," she said.
"I sat down with my head and the tears kept coming.
It's difficult to explain, but during the flight, I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."

Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreys Place inspiring news and phone numbers that can call people in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Madam Davis, her son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he was depressed first and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like how I feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney in the English graphical Gloucestershire, tells her son was a promising chef cheek with an steady grain.
"He was known for his smile.

Madam Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis has made the cards; "to let people know that there are others you can go and talk where you can, even if it's just a friend.

Mrs. Humpreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't tell him he felt depressive or something like that," she said.
'A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was totally on the ground on First Christmas - when the children extracted their gifts he didn't look at them at or so."
She said his death was a great trauma for her, but they should process it, "It's the whole family out of each other.
It's spreading us.

Board Kavanaugh's future uncertain while FBI starts research
'I thought that if we could get to each other what he asks; an investigation restricted in time and extent, we might be able to create some more unity', says Mr Flake last Saturday, to which he added that he was afraid that the Committee was falling out of each other, in the midst of a firmly disturbed patcture within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican followers not want the FBI to examine?
Their retirement has everything to do with timing.
The interim elections have been made bad in five weeks, on 6 November, and as expected, the Republicans are seriously challenging their efforts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the American Senate to lobby Mr Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr Bush, and thus his wife Ashley, who was his personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI has done the report?
The Senate will then be voting in which 51 republics and 49 democrats are currently held.
It is not yet clear that Mr Kavanaugh can count at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would give Mike Pence, vice-president, the possibility to make the decisive vote to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh at the Court of Justice.
Number of translators in North Korea 'omlaag' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean overlappers has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Onewording, explains that there were overlappers last year 1.127, compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human killers are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang did not respond publicly.
The vast majority of northern Korean overlappers is finally offered to the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoel, over 30.000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and where you can make the cross-section easier than in the strongly secure democraticized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the overseers more than illegal migrants than refugees and often turns them out with violence.
The relations between North and South, which are still formally in the state of war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, which was particularly spoken about the established negotiations on nuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historical meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in June in Singapore, which agreed in large lines to work to the nuclear defence of the Korean peninsula
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, accused of lack of progress in eliminating the US sanctions since then.
'without faith in US action, trust in our national security is lacking, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament', said Mr Ri at a talk for the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls board Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him inadequate to serve in the Court of Justice

Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help think that if a woman would act in this way, one would call her 'hysterical', Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh's testimony for the Senate Committee for Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the accusations that he would have abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening declaration, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes cried almost and was especially part of the region when he told about his family and his maternity of school.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him 'great and coordinated character killing', organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was not suitable to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the democrats.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with his statements and by the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats," says Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when her was asked whether she would try to introduce a impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the democrats would get the majority in the home of delegates.
'I can say this about it; if he does not tell the truth in the Congress, or against the FBI, he is not only inappropriate for the Court of Justice, but also for the court where he serves now', said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently judged at the Court of Justice of the District of Columbia (usually shorted D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a democracy that Kavanaugh will go against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (law for affordable health care). Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh polluted questions about the revision of certain decisions of the Court of Justice during the confirmation hearings.
"Don't expect us to stand happy if a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed in the Court of Justice," says Pelosi.
Women just have to admit to this.
It is a righteous tirad of months and years of overflowing anger, and it can only cry to get it out.
"We're gonna cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later to me.
"I don't think that weird, you are?"
She persecuted: "I was enormously helped by a woman who was somewhat leader and told that she also went to cry when she was angry. She developed a method that she always came to weep when she was angry, and to the one where she talked with, she said, "You might think I'm sad because I cried.
I'm angry."
And then she just cried further.
I just thought that brilliant."
Trans are partially acknowledged as expression of anger, because crying is essentially unfounded.
One of my best attended memories from a former job, in a dominated office of men, was when I had to cry terriblely because I was terrible. An elderly woman, a murderal business leader, who was a little afraid for everyone, grabbed me in my neckfel and scattered me into a staircase house.
"Don't let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and glad they've got you on the cassette.
Patricia Schroeder, then member of the Colorado Congress for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidateship for the Presidency.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was distracted in an extraordinary affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'cattenkwaad' or 'apenstreken') and returned from the race, the deep disappointed Mrs Schroeder believed that there was no reason why she would not make himself candidate.
"It wasn't a good decision," she told me 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last they needed was another candidate.
Someone talked about "Sneeuwwitje and the seven dwergen."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind with funds recruitment, so she promised not to participate plely if she couldn't bring $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1000, wanted to give her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a shortage?" she asked herself.
When she held her talk in which she made known that she would not start formal campaign, she was so exaggerated by feelings - of gratefulness for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach electors instead of delegates, and of anger about sexism - that she was insisting.
"Men would have thought that I had a nervouszination," Mrs Schroeder remembered how the media responded to her.
"They'd think Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember I thought, what will they put on my tombstone?
"She cried"?"
How the trade war between the US and China can benefit from Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the USA and China were overdouvenated, and although the fight has not been engaged, a long-term gap between the two countries could, according to experts, be favorable for Beijing.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, had previously given the first warning by increasing taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation was known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (EUR 150 billion) to goods; half of all goods income from China.
Peking has taken represailles every time, most recently by increasing prices from 5 to 10% for $60 billion to American goods.
China has promised to compare the US every time, and the worlds on a second largest economy will probably not knip quickly with the eyes.
In order to allow Washington to bow requests, but publicly bowing for the US is too painful for the Chinese president Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Peking plays the smart, the US trade war would be able to support China for a longer time, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
'The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Peking could create conditions, which could bring one of both countries into a economic free fall, is much more dangerous than viewers have recognized earlier', says Abigail Grace, a research worker of the 'Center for a New American Security', a thinker specialized in national security issues which focused on Asia.
Syria 'clear' to let refugees return, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a more than seven years of war.
During its talk for the UN General Assembly, stated Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, which improves circumstances in its country.
"Today, the situation is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to normalise the situation on site.
All circumstances are now present for the voluntary return from refugees to the country that they had to have left because of terrorism and the single economic measures threatening their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are about six million people in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome aid in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept any conditional assistance or aid from countries that had subsidised the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 by 10.5 at the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European ground and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish commandant Thomas Bjorn team achieved the required number of 14,5 points to beat the USA.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was almost the whole tournament, left his long battle from the tea into the water at par 3, hole 16, and gave his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shimmered in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever started 5-0-0 since the tournament in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the lowest scored by the European team, Thorbjorn Oles from Denmark, playing 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest classified player on the world ranking list, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 holes to play from Ian Poulter from Great Britain, which was possible to play last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanjaard Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so soon, but I can't do anything today.
It's been a difficult year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we have the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad that I could help," said a motivated Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the facility to his countrymen John Ram, who will defeat the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and get 1 holes into the Singles game on Sunday.
"The great proud I feel because I've reported Tiger Woods. I've always followed that guy when I grew up," says the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the largest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was fighting the weekend to find the fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high level throughout the tournament.
The U.S. commander, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team, "I'm proud of these boys, they have struck.
Shortly this morning, we made Europe a little more difficult.
We had opposition.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great commander.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup us. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup-Comité and we'll look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud of being their commander.
You need to take your hat for the opponent.
We're overplayed."
