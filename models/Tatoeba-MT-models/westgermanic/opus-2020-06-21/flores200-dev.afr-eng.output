This enables the shatter to rotate. If the shades to the right, turns the shatter to the right, if the shaats to the left, turn the shaatser to the left.
To return to their previous energy level, they must get rid of the extra energy they have obtained from light.
They do this by devoting a small particle of light, called a "photo".
Scientists call this process "stimulated emissions of radiation" because the atoms are stimulated by the bright light, which causes the release of a photo of light, and light is a type of radiation.
The following picture shows the atoms protoned. Of course, protons in the right life are far smaller than in the picture.
Photos are even smaller than the good of atoms!

The disadvantages of zoom lenses are that the complexity of the focus and number of lens elements required to gain ‘ a series of focus lengths is much greater than for prima lenses.
This starts less of ‘ a problem, since lens manufacturers gain higher standards in lens production.
This allowed focus lenses to make photos of quality comparable with lenses of determined focal length.
