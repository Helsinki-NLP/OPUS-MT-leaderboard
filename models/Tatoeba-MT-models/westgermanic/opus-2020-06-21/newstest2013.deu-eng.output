A Republican strategy to encounter the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to fight democracy.
However, the Brennan Center last considers a mythos by confirming that the fraud of election in the USA is rarer than the number of people killed by the flash.
The Republican lawyers have noted only 300 cases of fraud in the United States over 10 years.
One is sure that these new provisions will affect the participation of the elections.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the United States are responsible for carrying out the elections in each country.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of the American governments have announced new laws which have difficulty with the procedure for registration or origin.
This phenomenon has won significantly after the elections of November 2010, with 675 new republic representatives in 26 States.
As a result, 180 drafts were introduced alone in 2011, limiting the exercise of the voting law in 41 States.
The new electoral laws require the electors to present a light-screen identification and evidence of the US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for preliminary voting allowance, the right for invalid declares to register themselves as a voting day, and state citizens have spoken the voting law for which a court act occurs.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. State has required the voters to present a light-screen identification.
Indiana was the first state that raised such a claim.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities invited to extend this practice to other countries.
Over the last two years, they encouraged laws in the 34 states, with which the electors are forced to present a light image statement.
It is important to note that, in contrast to Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal identification card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of the US citizens, that is 21 million electoral persons, do not have any light image certificate issued by a government authority of their State.
In addition, five million new selectors in 2012 do not have such an indication.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often payable to receive the necessary indication.
From the new limitations, young people, minorities and people with low income are in proportionally strongly affected.
In fact, 25% of the Afro-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35.000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of the choosers between 18 and 29 years are not bound by the necessary lighting method.
This is still enough.
Students who are considered to be voting for democracy candidates, are not allowed in several countries to use their light-screen evidence issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of fishing or hunting associations to choose more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
No state has requested a proof of citizenship before 2004.
Arizona was the first state that introduced such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen state has adopted laws demanded by the electorates to demonstrate their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at restricting hispanese votes.
Because it is on the hand that two of three hispanic electors prefer the democratic party.
In addition, republikan lawmakers 2011 have promoted laws in eight states with which the registration of electorates was abolished on the preferential day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without any consequences.
For example, the campaigns contributed to the electoral registration in the 2004 general elections to register about 10 million citizens.
Because by the measures adopted since 2009, the share of registration of new selectors has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican laws have adopted laws in five other states aiming at shortening the period for premature voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the pre-selected Afro-Americans, although they were only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the hispanical population.
Last only 11% of the electorates, but 24% of the citizens who pre-elected.
In contrast, the whites who represented 76% of the choosers were only 46% of the choosers who pre-selected.
Of course, democratic lawmakers and their followers have energically opposed the adoption of laws which restrict the registration of the voters.
Several laws were blocked by the vetos of the democratic governors.
The U.S. Advocate General has attacked to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damages.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws that require the prescribing of a light-image.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly encounter the exercise of the voting law.
The democratic critics contemplate the political nature of the adopted laws and see in them as a clear objective the influence of the results in the countries emerging for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those States who have adopted these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes necessary in the voting body to win the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the laws of the election system will have significant impact on the result of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one is certain: these new provisions will be negatively affected by the participation of the elections.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostatakrebsfrequency: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes indicates incorrect results with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical intervention.
This leads to a stronger horrific of the already unsecured men for the implementation of pre-examination tests.
Whether or not to make the test
We have read the opinion of two specialists.
In the U.S. studies, numerous factors of disorder between the control groups existed, so that it is difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there was a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that after 12 years of follow-up, the probability of the training of metastas is greater than 30 to 40% if no early detection was carried out.
That is why I recommend the test from 50 years old and 40 years of age when you have a direct relative who has already been diseased by prostatakrebs.
In the case of men of Afro-American origin, there is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer was recognized.
There are cancer species that are aggressive and others in adolescent.
The patient has to make the extent of his cancer disease really understandable by showing him the possible options for prostat cancer cannot be treated if it does not affect life quality in a long time and in these cases it is more important to active monitoring of the disease.
Today there is no treatment in many men who have been recognized to cancer, since her cancer is not aggressive and is not a threat to their lives.
They are suggesting active monitoring and offer them treatment when progressing the disease.
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for a decision, who should be treated and who is not.
That is why I recommend the test's implementation.
However, it is most important to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be performed or not.
In collaboration with the International Society for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that enables us to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevents of the disease
Unfortunately there is no miracle for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle of the best way to reduce the risk of raising him.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer diseases could be prevented if everyone eats well and would move sufficiently.
"If there were no smokers anymore, this value would at least rise to 50%," stressed André Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian cancer society.
However, approximately 10% of cancer diseases are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lungs cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancer species.
It's strongly damaged human health.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after dismissing the cigarette, the risk of cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the Canadian cancer society, overweight and adipositas also promote the outbreak of disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, barbecue, measuring arms, food tubes, stomach pigment and bovine mother cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity is protecting against barbecue cancer throughout the life," he adds.
The Food
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large amount, the risk of illuminating on a grimm or mastdarm cancer increases.
Worst goods should also be missed.
Conservation of meat by smokers, drys or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"Later, the body cells can damage and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamine
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not clever.
According to the Canadian cancer society, studies on vitamin E are contradictive.
While a study discovered the reduction in prostata cancer risk, another has shown an increase rather.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly shown.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses how important it is to talk to his doctor about his concerns and his family prelasting.
"The implementation of an early identification test does not lead to cancer."
Analysis of the Higgs Boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs Boson has stimulated a certain elevation in the last summer, and this for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this Boson is involved in nothing less than in the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence of the standard model - our best or "the least false" declaration of the nature and the behavior of matter - foretold but was not yet observed empirically.
But for the physicians, it is not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is strongly similar to the Higgs Boson, predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data that was presented on a large physics convention in Kyoto this week, but there are no data yet to be perfectly secured.
Still, we assume that it really is the Higgs, as it seems that there is only a low risk of deception, and we look at what it is.
There is a prerequisitely unusual law in this world, which results in that two objects cannot be present at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try too strong, as you are being wounded.
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it also indicates that it applies to such a law: the Pauli's exclusion principle, which means that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "Quantity", with this "destination" in large and entirely consisting of some of their properties.
Of this, the physicians integrate the particles into two categories.
In a corner, the good citizens are called Fermione and are individually obedient to the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons, an ugly band of anarchists, who are not holy, in any case do not move this principle, meaning that they can actually be at the same place at the same time.
According to The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Labors (which is absolutely amazing), these botans are listed in two groups: the mesons we are not being treated here and the "power participants" by which the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs Boson were somewhat related.
But it must be stressed here that these bombs are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chrome, then only thanks to a Boson of exceptional Banity: the photographs or the "Light Particle" that is the "Bote" of the electromagnetic force.
For example, if a particle speeds up with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "suppressed" in the place, such as a cable stone that has been thrown into a pond.
This "storting" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation etc.) and this wave is nothing other than a photo and therefore one of the bonuses "trackers of power".
Balancer field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "crashed" so that this Boson can be shown.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the excavator must reach very high energy, a little comparable with a frozen pond, whose surface could only be fought by a very large rock.
That is why a huge particle-speaker such as the CERN is required - the Great Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! - to reach such energies.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, there are not all particles and not all materials interacting with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this but others not - for example, a sheet would never keep paper from itself at the fridge.
And even not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while others (like the photos) do not have a mass.
For what can all these researches be "good" now, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science they serve the review of the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicians to examine all the differences between the observes and the forecasts of the SM.
There are also many physicians who are most eagerly hoping that such differences are found, as the least difference opens a door to a "new physics" and could stop some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter is still large deficiencies, as there is no statement for the heavy force (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (new ups!).
However, such deviations were not found in the CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of this research on the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that it is not.
In the early 1960s, the laser pioneers did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the deceased physician Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was discovered in the 1960s, and the in 1962 even developed the first durable laser (the first pulsed) - has already said that the laser was considered rather than a "labor games" at the beginning.
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also be made from all the instruments surrounded by research.
For example, Willard Boyle 1969 has developed a small light sensor during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as "Auge" and has introduced him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our life, but it means that you can really never know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
With her Committee on Deaths in Würde, Quebec recently discussed the provoked question of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is prepared.
However, there is still much to do in this important topic.
Le Devoir has tried to consider this closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostat cancer that brought him up had left him a two-year period.
"They gave me five years to live, I have worked seven years," he said half-hearted, in his bed in the home for Palliative Care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived on the morning.
"On the other hand, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared," he says.
The disease makes its work: an indispensable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating.
On the table sitting in front of a delicious lunch, he will resign in to help you eat.
It will be courageous to smile him and to talk to the strangers who are busy around him to bring him his medicines and offer him a bathroom.
The courage of normal death.
"My greatest desire is to heal my diarrhea as this is humiliating," he tells us.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our life, we learn that a man pinkelt in the sting," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in the home Victor-Gadbois.
To return to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humility for some people.
"This depends on the ability of the person," a relapse, he determines.
For, several people who work in the palace care believe that great events will take place in the midst of these retreats.
Patients who are assigned to the Victor-Gadbois home are all suffering cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In this stage, they will no longer exceed their care with such "healing" care by doctors and nurses.
For Ms. A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by neglect".
But through the disease I really knew my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no wishes anymore in life," she says before she accepts that one sets up a mask that helps her to breathe.
In the next days, she still expects a last visit to her son who comes from Italy.
The home Victor-Gadbois offers a group of volunteer body care and helping in food consumption.
Palliative care will then be used if there are no other possibilities.
To make the dying more pleasant.
In Quebec a bed comes on 11.700 inhabitants for Palliative care.
That's very little if you take into account that we'll die all one day.
Here the life is continued under best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
You are granted to death depending on the desire of a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetics no longer have to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we served Mr. X a beer who died overnight.
Today morning his son will drink the beer at feet of the dead one.
"We help relatives and patients equally," reports nurse director Nathalie Savard.
In the home Victor-Gadbois there is no day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family meeting in the courtyard and is well supported by his headaches, while you take an honor, a young man of 36 years died by his parents, his wife and his two children in a tragic way after trying to survive everything.
"Since six months, three to five beds are always occupied with cancer patients less than 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel worried.
53% of patients assigned to Victor-Gadbois are from their residence, 47% come from the hospital.
The problem of access to the Palliative Care
It is said that 77% of the Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to a care that should help patients suffer if the final stage of their life has reached both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Home Victor Gadbois and the Society for House Palliative Care in the Great Area of Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
This great inadequateness in Quebec’s healthcare ensures that several doctors specialized in palliative care ensure the adoption of a law on the arrangement of death aid and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October, a manifest has been signed by prominent personalities of Palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in order to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec’s health system is not capable of ensuring that all the right to high-quality Palliative care before accepting the death aid.
Shortly before, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency, without taking measures to her lend.
I'm afraid that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several on-cologenic treatments have lost their patients, despite the worst forecasts, until the last day.
Helène's survival shances were already minimal when she aborted a harmful chemotherapy.
When I told my uncologin that I was going to abort treatment, she answered me that she regretted that I had the fight, she told.
But she told me that I was at the end!
No surgery care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die are thanks to the nurse person that it did not take place this wish after their pain has been illuminated by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly said that pallicide care in pain treatment is not surrounded.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of the Palliative Care of the House's Palliatary Care of the Great Area of Montreal, 8% of patients do not address pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, doctors often fall back to terminal sedation, which continues to interfere either traced or permanently until the date of his death.
We are no longer able to do as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain impairment will have more and more the opportunity to withdraw to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pains are not lend, say all of the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to sleep me," but "I want my pain to be lindered."
The realization of this report was possible due to a journalism type of Canadian health research institutions.
Real estate scandal large sizes in Quebec
Officials of the street construction office, company of the construction headquarters, moneyschaffer political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia each day tell what they know about a great "system" in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unions and Mafioso.
A "industry", which was very expensive for the Quebec taxpayer, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is remarkable as the system is broken since you have taken drastically action," says Jacques Ducheneau, Member in Quebec, and former head of the Montreal Police.
The scandal was discovered by him as a result of an incoming investigation of contamination in relation to the contracts on road construction in Quebec, which had only voted against the former minister.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and ordering officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he stressed, "only the Ministry of Transport has spared a billion dollars in the contracts," because some pulled their instinct to receive their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already taken two burgemeesters," he adds, in the hope that it manages to "repeat the tactics behind the individuals".
A 2011 life-running, permanent anticorruption unit
The 2011 filed, permanent anticorruption unit is also taking great efforts with its troops in economic auditors, resources and analytics of the government.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau-Truppe", which has made it since 2009 that the "channelization card" of Montreal occurs in the artificial excavation of the contracts...
During the last few weeks, she has been raising throughsights and accused of fraud and corruption against local mandates such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcot, the mayor of a suburb.
The next one on the list would have come back by Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just returned from his office as the Mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
He is suspected to have repeatedly taken swallow money in the exchange of public procurement.
In addition, engineers of the Street Construction Office of Montreal, including entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Acurso and Lino Zambito, were accused.
The latter has excited overlook by explaining the functioning of the "System" for the preservation of public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mediator related to the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the years 2000, Mr Zambito had his hand in the game, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals at that time.
He also managed to organise an illegal means creation for the former liberal Vice President Nathalie Normandeau.
Channelisation contracts whose costs were artificially blewned
In Montreal the "System" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant has detailedly described this before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and iceockey games, as well as order fees of 73,000 dollars as a counterlast for channelization contracts whose costs he artificially blew up.
Other officials of the road construction office have admitted that they were slaughtered by exposing the accounts with false additional services artificially by 30-40%.
In addition, a organizer of the mayor, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr Tremblay that he had deliberately looked down a shadow budget that filled his bags with black money.
As a result of these enthusiasms Mr Tremblay returned early November, which took Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first members who killed the alarm.
As the mayor of the city's district Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she refused against the sale of a municipal land that was acquired for $5 million and continued to builders in the tree real estate market from 2010.
70% Black money in election campaigns
From the investigation that is carried out last, she says that it "smote into a fade that enables the functionality of the system of ameisen to stop the evil and practise the guilty."
She says that the procedure is "tangible but positive".
We are purging the wounds, but we only needed a research unit for Montreal, as well as an oversight to prevent the return of fragile practices.
How to clean.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau notices that "beamtes have stolen several hundreds of millions of dollars," however, focuses on the role of "mandates who are over the tactics in the image", if they were not in fraud!
As a result of a share of 70% black money in the financing of the campaigns in Quebec, he says: "I was told that this is just a weak disappointment of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the donations to parties to $100, which would not change him by means of the situation: "As long as the election campaign expenditure will not be strictly limited, black money will be in turn."
He recommends a complete revision of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by moving things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international view of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr Duchezneau calls on those who laugh about throwing a glance into their own courtyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have accepted a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I make progress every day on her side.
The technical person has also given me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level every day.
And with a game this is even easier.
In the soccer, everything goes very fast.
But I wasn't exciting.
Since my beginnings in the centre of preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Étienne I have always made progress.
So they make use of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new accesses of this summer are used to carry out very high levels.
They also know that each training unit is explicit.
This leads to a player like me to offer the front and give his best.
Besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me much in relation to my play position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played at the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti inflates respect for all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in the Ligue 1 and it is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back to a rich experience and has won many titles with renowned associations.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win another title in Paris.
In January, I have conducted a encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has set in me is also a statement for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon took us the place of the top rider.
But we're lying in the back.
One of our most important objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified ourselves in this way for the Achtelfinal.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to come as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our voting against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group before Porto, so that we can perform the play of the Achtelfinal as a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European association in the short term?
He's already having the budget for this...
In order to become a large European association, Paris has to gain title and make itself a name for long-term time.
This is not the case today.
The PSG will provide the funds for this project to take concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure to not win the title in the Ligue 1 as this was the case in the last season?
Of course this would be a great disappointment.
This year we are really in the heart of calling this title.
In the last season, we were closed.
In May we were disappointed, as we were strong enough to make the victory away.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We completed with 79 points.
Usually you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, that by Montpellier, has reached a even better season.
I think this year is the right thing.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux ring around the title, I believe we have the stuff to win him.
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have is normal that much of us is expected.
We accept this perfectly.
However, when we win a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something you can suggest, this is certainly frustrating.
You wonder what the people are expecting.
We can never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
In the Champions League, we proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, a association who hasn't created two seasons to qualify for the Achtelfinal, and who has also made huge expenditure!
In view of the invested sums you believed for playpause with 15 points forward!
This meant that our opponents and the French champion would be left out of sight.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good during the last season, were "birth" by this new PSG.
This shows that the ligue is 1 exciting.
I hope that we will be May May of the laughing winners and we say that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So better you talk about a "Zlatan dependency".
That means that Ibrahimovic is a high-performance tool and shoots many gates.
That's why he came and proves that he's the star of the Ligue 1.
Everywhere, where he played, he has led to the view that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those who surround him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages the others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders worldwide, also enables all others to make progress.
How did you experience EM 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was in my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my infringement prevented me from striking out some time of time.
I've seen things from which I've been strengthened.
Today I manage to achieve good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "blue".
From what has been done in Ukraine, we have drawn our teaching, and today we have to show an exemplary behavior.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the WM.
The national trainer is strict, stands close to players and stimulates for victory.
As it was the same as the Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "blue" to Brazil.
Is that forced in Spain on 16 October a match game (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has used for all others.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin, payments and sales are possible without banking
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
In addition, as often as in these technologies, a political vision is profound: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopols, leads to financial crisiss.
In fact, the bitcoin found by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertable to dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent that allows direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 2000,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousands of websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the Bitcoin course had reached a maximum level of $30 (23 euro) in June 2011, he fell five months later to $2, before he recovered to $10 (the courses are listed on the Bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the global trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown this interest in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "like conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other kinds of virtual currencies such as the "Cln", which are used to progress in a video game that can be won or purchased by games (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed each time by a central authority.
At the same time, all network notes are maintainers of the account book, auditors, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users will actually take place between two email addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymousity.
A series of data related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the handled bitcoins are available in the public accounts book spread throughout the network.
The crucial step is to introduce this new transaction in this book.
This happens through a mathematical task launched on the computers, while the winner who is a kind of provisional central banking has the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a piece of the file, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add it a number before the whole "cap" is "capped".
The aim is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (and many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay for fraud twice very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated from the network and the other remains without linking, as both different fingerprints have.
The computer that has solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward is regularly half, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins found in the round are thus limited to 21 million but can be shared to a hundred million set, which makes a certain room...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement of the accounting performance.
The network life has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide Bitcoin services were attacked and the bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The weakening point does not concern the actual protocol," assured Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the network bitcoin.
The ECB also reports on the opportunities of money laundry with the help of this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these deficiencies.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse to donate this kind.
They are accepted by others like the WordPress Blog Platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel have analyzed the account book and showed that nearly 80% of the bitcoins are not around.
In November a sale of Mega was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul company, is pleased to convert the bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also author of a book about this currency, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or contactless payment with a mobile phone but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with the distributors, and the latter cannot install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to specify one address that can be photographed and detected by a phone, Pierre Noizat gives that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in which hiërarchical systems are considered for more horizontally-oriented systems.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin continues, but may be a turnpoint in 2013," he prognoses.
In its report, the ECB also proposes to reassess the different risks that today are considered as high in the event of a success of this currency.
We're taken away from Afghanistan.
And then?
French forces left their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow in 2014.
It is time that Afghan army retreats the possession of its territory and that the Afghan population decides its future without expecting everything from us.
We have punished the Afghan farmers in particular by considering them as terrorists.
And we ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and devoted.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders fleeing to Pakistan, but often also from farmers who refuse a armed foreign presence as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they have joined jihadists, Pakistan, Arabs, Uzbeki and Tadschiken.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by the local rebels, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries are discreet.
The deduction of the French troops from the base point in Newrab, which I observed by a hill planted with mandle trees, which was financed by French loans, was correct.
The surrounded truck and tank convoys have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more flows of Taliban in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their unwide march from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, and the country was overridden by war because of the battles of the various exhibitors.
Their power acquisition was then regarded as a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women paid the price for obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved until now.
Former Mudschaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subsequent position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Sovjetic war again came to power in 2001.
They have changed into business emerging by taking stocks of the government to sell them as a construction country to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefited from the massive American submission of subcontracts.
They have been plagued, and most of them were not even involved in the fights.
As I heard it in the campaigns, people wish a government that does not arise from thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who could make use of American uses: the capital flight is significant.
Young people have sat down the war and its ideology.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed their benefits.
About 65% of the population is below 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the first parties, or to corrupt certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are possessed by mobile phones; television with its Turkish series that represent a modern world will be viewed everywhere.
A army is now available.
Will the authorities, under which command force they are being held, be considered legitimate?
Former Communists of the anti-Sovjetic struggle are already strived to restore the militia in the province, which will deprive the power of central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identitys should have benefited from some decentralisation in the example of the Western Nations, but by dispensing the Office of the Minister-president, which was since the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralized state with a strong presidial force.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially on the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 50s and has long before.
Industries have not been rebuilded, functional stairs are not present, and important watering systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported;, except for fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be left priority.
In a country based on 30 years of war, state control of infrastructures would have been necessary.
The gentle was spread that Afghanistan had enormous ground treasures.
This still strengthens the impression that the Western countries were only on the spot to do so.
Without energy in order to process local ice or copper, or without means of transport for a export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have already left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) on the huge Buddhist site leave their excavations and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day, it will also be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The deduction of the French battle forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aids: girl and boygymnasia, French institute to universities, French institution, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-militarian actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was set up in 2012, has carried out numerous non-governmental works and measures to renovate agriculture and by a small French non-governmental organization in order to try to win the "Hearts and Spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of compatibility of aid and open action.
These work, which had been necessary for many local workers, could have contributed to suppressing resistance: water, spring, drinking water, reforcing, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in agricultural areas.
What souvenir do we return after military expenditure of two billion euros?
A much more moderate budget will help to improve local living conditions which are very hard in these often in a height of more than 2000 meters.
In the message, thousands of written requests have received small agricultural projects from municipalities of the province of Capisa.
In order to free farmers from the rebellion led by foreign groups, which is their desire according to their own statements, the continuation would be less, well-controlled and it would be necessary for their benefit to be directly involved in civil aid.
A Constitution with the Brechstange in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt is more than ever split in relation to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants him the unprecedented power, he has decided to put everything on a map.
For the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly will be agreed on the next day.
A week ago, the Head of State of State had granted two additional months for the conclusion of his work.
Egypt has now been based on a preliminary, multiplely modified text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal breakdown.
This new initiative has only provided a stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the President is persisting in his "autocratic delegation" by continuing "browning his word" and "passing the right with feet".
On the side of his supporters, it is guaranteed that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to accelerate the transitional process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period that forces the brothers to stop their projects to explain the Egyptians the section for section.
For the President, it is also a way to restore its public and democratic legitimacy while the protests are all over the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American Week Show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote well-wolkly.
In addition to Egyptian people, with this relapse, an ultimatum is put: "Once she agrees for my draft or I keep the unprecedented power," the latter should, after the constitution has been adopted, take an end.
85 most of the Islamist members of this constitutional congregation have adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the liberals did not comply with the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in the middle of November, they have turned away because they believed that they have not been able to bring their viewpoints into effect.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve decision-making capacity, 11 persons, deputy members, were added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the moslims.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly unanimously adopted.
The commentators, on the other hand, felt that the only difference of opinion of the day... came to be expressed in the time for prayer, since some members of the body were of the opinion that the pole of the Constitutional Assembly did not go exactly.
The text that has been adopted yesterday evening consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 which draws attention to itself remains identical with that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Scharia are the main source of law".
The salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" by "the rules" which would have made a more strict application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article was not changed is a proof of their good will and of respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Humanity" replied to the liberals who only see this as a propaganda attack.
Because they are according to the Islamization of the Constitution on other articles.
In particular, Article 220 of the Treaty, which is granted to the University of Al-Azhar a consultative function, in particular as regards the verification of conformity with the laws of Scharia.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "the people who are asked for an opinion have not been chosen and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocration in this".
In addition, the fears of the liberals are counted by the fact that the next recruitor of this university may be far less disagreed than the present.
"Then is not to recognise a specific religious commitment.
With this constitution, we remain in the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers working on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained partly in the French system", explains Alexis Bluet, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian constitutional transit.
He admits, however, "that, in respect of Article 220, there can be a multitude because the terms used are rejected to the religious vocabulary.
In particular, one refers to the "Fiqh" [islamic justice, anm. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question of how far civilians are competitive to decide about it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is highly criticized by the far-reaching powers he grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslims argue that these are significantly reduced in comparison with the former regime.
Another issue: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wish of the military, the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense Council.
There will also be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as it called for associations to defense human rights.
The latter shall also inform their fears regarding the text which it considers as a delicate.
The blasphemie's acts will be maintained, and breaches are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to free opinion, especially for the press.
In addition, no more refers to the protection of women, Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In their opinion, the only positive point is the ban on the torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to express himself on television yesterday evening, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The leaders of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect sacred places, the Nabel of the world and a sea from Sole
The praised country combines the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort, and an unfavorable nature.
AIF calls you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Blood before the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, in which Jesus was baptized.
It means that all those who bathed in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus brought his miracles: the migration of water in wine on a wedding celebration, the walking on the water, the silence of the sea storm and the fishing.
Here Jesus appeared his disciples after the resurrection.
Most sanctuaries, however, find themselves in Jerusalem.
Faithful believers go here the path of passion or crossway of Jesus Christ (at Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The way begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretoria, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the Old City to the grave church on the Mount Golgotha, where the crossing site, the Salbungsstein and the grave of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view of the Nabel of the world, which symbolizes human salvation.
The cluster of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands on the place where a Christian legend grows according to the tree, from which the cross was made for the crossing of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the Klavians, the remains of a temple, destroyed by the Romans in 70th century.
Traditionally, there people leave different beliefs with desires that are then in fulfillment.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the Massada fortress form the remains of the secret hidden against enemies, which Herod the Great made up for his family in 25 p.m.
They are on a rocky wall in the mountains in 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountain climbers can reach ruins from their own strength.
All others bring an air car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, the famous Hermon skiing area is 1600 to 2040 meters, in which it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you will get there with a shuttle bus.
The skiers have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, heidenic gods lived on the mountain mountain.
A unique museums visit
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
At just one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be given a visit.
Below is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parlament).
Old Qumran manuscripts or scripts from the dead sea found in rock stations in the Judean wilderness are preserved as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There, the collection of works of impressions and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is issued.
In Akko you can visit the museum at the Bad Al Basha, which stores several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and bathing servants.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli museum where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum leaders nor souvenir shops.
Entry is free, and donations are in principle rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum and Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, relates to one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most important department is the monument for the children who were built to remember the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room, there is total darkness.
Stars pulse.
And the names of the Jewish children and of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
Israel's three most important recreational areas are on the coasts of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
On each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanarians.
Amazingly, the red sea is bathed also in winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The dead sea is even warmer and the whole year is bathed.
Besides, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turkis blue water has a high salt content and does not even make it difficult on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is surprisingly beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt sole) and healing, and treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczemen, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease and stressed nerve.
Strict on the Secrets of the Age
The old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast, is bound by these secrets.
Due to this city, the famous seaway, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia passed together.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient legends.
According to traditions, Noah just built his Arch here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda, with which he led a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to shrink through the narrow streets named after star characters.
Fortuna should be the legend after all that touch the walls in the street with their star characters.
In Jaffa you can meet newly missed couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photodates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can strike through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the cruises.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and Residenz of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilatus.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and operas are listed today.
List of tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your bad English knowledge: About 30% of Israeli speak Russian.
You would like to take the money in the trip to no euros, but to dollars that can be easily switched into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you are going forward to the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway train and in Haifa the only U-Bahn line of the country with six stations connecting the suburb with the upper city.
It is precisely an underground station.
A ride within the city costs independent of the transport product 6 shekels, which is sufficient for a trip of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath began in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday markets and shops are closed, and public traffic rests.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants only food is served for food, which includes pig meat, sea products, fish without shoes and foods containing both milk and meat products.
Rather, you have the choice between various courts with hammel and beef, soap and desserts (pared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish Humus pistols, different soßs, featured balls of peasant beans and herbs (fales) as well as fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no ruining dogs.
There are many well-favoured cats for that that are cozy and unhelligned by the streets.
In the evening, she is even sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like living places and don't say no to leakery.
A car rental costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance also costs $15 per day.
And cycling costs 15 shekels per day.
Introduction cards for museums cost 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, over three million tourists from all over the world have visited Israel.
Most apostates and reception seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012 118.8 Thousands of Ukraine tourists came to the lobstered country, which corresponds to an increase of 51% compared to the comparison period in 2010 before the visa obligation was repealed on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While Members and citizens discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with false certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tadschikistan and Turkmenistan.
Your only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families that are stayed in the home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force which, according to each work migrant, has to carry out a test to certify knowledge of the Russian language.
To date, this scheme applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the local housing sector and in the retail trade.
However, the tests are intended to be required for all guest workers in the future, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
It is not only necessary for language tests but also for tests to the Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the conservation and renewal of working permits.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian officials are.
Also from this law, persons who have received their educational certificates and diplomas before the suspension of the USSR in 1991 are exempt.
Sensitiveness, problem and protection of rights
The totality of the test bodies will be under the Egypt of the Puschkin Institute for the Russian language, the Russian University of the People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the Saint Petersburg University of State and other Russian universities.
The migrants can rely on the tests in all the cities and have already been opened in Russia for more than 160 corresponding centers.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
However, before the entry into force of the law in the press, civil laws asked several times the following question: What does the whole actually bring?
What changes does the prescribe to suggest language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Especially, deferred speaker of the migration authority, it is important to reduce the number of forced workers.
"Many now talk about the protection of workers' rights," says the head of the representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tadschikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must be protected before their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
On problems, migrants struggling without occupation, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without linguistic knowledge will necessarily meet people with evil intentions who will put him into a dark, close baraque under the pretext of help, where he will endure with dozens of his equal months without food and documents, and will create 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home, the promise will be promised, and when you arrive, you will be deceived, receive their passes and do not receive the promised reward," confirmed the Head of the Working Migration Director of the Tadschic Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't shoot, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who want to earn their money admit that they can hardly express themselves in their own language, not only in the language of the country of destination.
Of course, this is not so much its debt rather than the evil: Only a few towers, Uzbeki and Tadschiken can only be a reasonable basic education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, swear because of buying them appropriate clothing, shoes and school matters.
As a teenager, these children then take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizens stress the following important aspect of the law.
The test only needs to lay down migrants with legal status.
If you do not have this status, there is no test and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, the majority of guest workers continue to stay illegal in Russia.
"Hardly welcome" or "accession for unauthorised"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is the bureaucratic barriers and, of course, the speaking difficulties.
Additionally, legalisation costs money: 12 to 16 thousand Rubles.
A false registration can be made quickly and just for an inhalb thousand.
The stakeholders of the Russian police know that our documents are mainly false and we are not registered, and then there are cases of depression.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," explains Tadschike Umed Huschkadamov to journalists.
"Don't shoot any cost for false papers"
Even on the day when the law entered into force, it found that not only the registration documents of Migrants could be false.
Some misleading certificates that certificate to dissolution of the language test have already been taken by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The false papers were printed with a normal color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get these: Every migrant who hoped to save the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost for the official test: This costs a Migrant of three thousand rubles.
In addition to the main direct task of protecting the system from corruption so that certificates cannot be easily purchased, both officials and civilians agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they receive time for a language course.
In addition, new procurements will be offered without language skills in areas where no active consultation is necessary with people.
Interior Ministry ignored illegal arms market
The share of legal weapons in crimes is extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry plans to strengthen the arms law for private arms owners.
In this way, the authorities respond to the latest events: infringements of shooting on weddings and seven dead during the amoklauf of Moscow jurisdiction Dmitri Wingradow.
The police want to forbid non-todly weapons in the public and set up the age for the possession of shoe weapons from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal supported and promised the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Korruption, Irina Jarowaja, that the changes in the Army Law are presented shortly in the Duma.
Not all are satisfied with that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by attracting the screws.
On the Internet, an open letter was published, whose author - representatives of various arms associations - demanded to take away from "sindless deteriorations".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, the criminal lawmaker, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of BBC.
According to the statistics of the Interior Ministry, 142 crimes were carried out with the application of the registered weapons during six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand delicates were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a deterioration of the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from serving on the black market.
At present you can find the authors in Moscow any possible weapon for little money.
In the meantime, the Interior Ministry stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factorys to the off-official
The weapons have reached several channels on the black market.
There are five such main channels, relating to a former senior Viktor Baranez, who was active in the Ministry of Education and the General tab for ten years.
Screenshot of a website that accepts arms orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fight in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen both by the Russian orphans as well as the cows themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel illegal weapons that are stolen order guards of criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons that were stolen from both the police chambers and directly by employees of the criminal prosecution authorities.
Other illegally sold weapons are from military arms camps.
Many military camps often included explosions.
"There are evidence that there were some cases of fire founding to interfere with the lack of weapons," says former military officer.
A contribution to the Black Market in accordance with Baranez also to arms producers.
"Todays there are countless private armor factorys that do not stand the international competition and therefore deteriorate the weapons on the black market, such as Moscow," reports the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Especially many pistols and guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is an own, sometimes handmade production as well as a mafia organizing the slaughter," explains the former military member.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011 a report was published by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
Experts analysed reports from the Interior Ministry and the Federal Service for State Statistics, kriminological literature and publicly accessible data on portals on weapons.
The main part of the illegal weapons is from the army and the jurisdiction authorities.
The half of all the weapons on the black market were there by the "proof of responsible people who have come to do with weapons in their work", says the report.
According to the researcher’s data, 17% of the weapons from conflict areas, 14% are falling on theft in arms production, and 5% are from illegal excavation.
A sales consultant of a armor who does not want to be called assures that weapons found in illegal excavation have been purchased for a long time as they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more often that merchants are concerned about the after-up in a weapon camp.
A gun is purchased, for example, a pistool of the type TT.
The weapon is distributed and passed through the magic.
"The dealer brings the gun into the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he recalls
"The police, of course, know about everything and therefore, if it cannot hold up the plan for detecting crimes, carrying out periodic control purchases for dealers offering illegal weapons", the seller adds.
How in Luxury
Buyers and sellers find the most common about acquaintances.
I had regarded websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and wanted to come to the station "Begowaja", where a person would wait for me who breached me at a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the gun I first learned there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To worry a weapon, I need a knowing who has contacts," the seller recalls. "I have known such a person, but I don't trust him."
There are merchants on the markets, but there you must go and use a code like "from Ivan Ivan Iwanowitsch that allows the daughter to lose a tooth".
I'm even coming to some rings about a knowing person I trust.
He's only giving me the rings because he knows that I don't preserve him.
New people are looking for weapons in various ways.
In the middle of the 1990s, the former military officer Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons when he wrote an article on this subject.
As a result, the schemes did not change him.
He received a photo album in which "all possible" was trained.
"I felt like the luxury shop," the military host remembers.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
I as a potential customer, not only buy, but ride with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target disc.
"I can shoot there then, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we are negotiating each other," the expert describes the action.
Shopping from the Sofa
Internet search engines show search results on websites and groups in "Vkontacts", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No papers are required nor there are personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate sum of money," says in the advertising ad on the "Camp pistols or wards" website.
There users offer your orders and request requests.
Is it also sold for minor years?
Of course without license, user asks 'Iwan' (public quote).
"Capte a TT. Moscow" is the laconic question of "Fedorenkow".
The federal security service swallowed shortly countless slices web pages, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the network.
People come like hungry fish at the feeding and then land in Siberia and may swallow coal
Military commentator and former military host Viktor Baranez
I heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Responsibles shall accept the orders.
The buyer transmits the money via a banking machine.
"As a response, he receives a photo and a description of the hidden weapon," reports the press speaker of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that, for the end, you can go empty and come behind grids if you place an application on a website.
The federal security service swallowed shortly countless slices web pages, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the network.
"The people come like hungry fish at the feeding and then land in the Zibrian labour camp and may swallow coal," he says.
A Macarow for 100 US dollars
When purchasing illegal shoes, experts are due to expecting prices from 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislow from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a pistool of the Macarow type for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait for a half months.
The weapon is released in military arms camps by overseers medium ranges.
According to the official statistics of the Interior Ministry, the number of delicates with illegal weapons throughout Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand in the period from January to October 2011, while the number of cases covered by theft and impression in the context of weapons, munition, explosives and sprays shrinked by 7.8%.
Fast-food and supermarket employees in the United States
Every fourth U.S. youth sits behind the cash of Mc Donald's
Over the past days, there were massive protests against low wages in Walmart's branches and restaurants of popular fast-food chains like Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will still be swelling, or whether the air will soon come out again.
The tests are supported by unions and several left-oriented organisations.
In addition to the increase in the moderate wages of simple Walmart and Fast Food employees, the organisations of the protests pursue the objective of establishing unions.
So far this industry is hardly organized by the economy.
46 Cents per year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, in which sales took place in the United States, which attracted millions of customers, which meant to be hand-share.
On this day, some Walmart employees, from which there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and stressed together with trade unions and left activists branches of the chain, whose target group is low and medium income.
Walmart sells all products, from windels via hunting weapons and car batteryes to dust cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart complex is more cheap than in large super markets in cutting between 8 and 27%.
Therefore, many of the lowly paid Walmart employees buy only at their own job.
The prices and the range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods only so cheap because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complains about severe working conditions, for example lacking Gabel Stepper or Hand Scanner.
The participants at the "Black Friday" demanded an increase in wages and expressed their anger that the contribution for the occupational health insurance was increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart co-worker who deserves 9.5 dollars the hour couldn't afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company increases the average wage to 12 dollars the hour, Walmart would cost 3.2 billion dollars.
These are approximately 1.1% more than they are now spending for wage.
Will Walmart completely relocate the salary increases to the customers, each purchase cost it only 46 cent more in the future.
For each year, this would be for them compared to today more than $12,39.
Walmart's supporters are pleased to note that it only came to protest in nine states and that they did not damage losses to the company.
The black Friday lasted the next day in his shop from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight, and in this period, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart cabinets at the Black Friday carried out nearly 100 million transactions.
The company's speaker, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the Huffington Post, that totally "less than five" Walmart employees were working and the protest action was only "a further PR-Trick" of the union organized by the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests went on this week in New York, however, where their goal was not Walmart-Filials (which are not desired in this advanced city and therefore inexistent), but McDonald's and other price-efficient restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company sells billions of portions, and yet you don't give any sickness, and you won't pay for your honest work!
Jumane Williams, member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage is the hour according to federal and New York legislation at 7.25 dollars.
In fast-food restorants, the minimum wage is reduced, but not too strong, and in the average, their simple employees in New York receive 8.90 US dollars the hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this durable city.
As it is possible to get out in New York with so little money, I'm uncommon.
There was a time when almost one quarter of all U.S. adolescents were behind the Teke after school at McDonald's school, but young people were still living with their parents.
The source of income or planned to remain longer there was nearly one.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, I'm constantly confronted with people who complain that they have to get out of this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal Forum, whose author notes that it is responsibly to get children if you don't know how to feed it.
The participants of the protests started on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cassians and cooks of Fast-Food-Restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 dollars, more than double the present minimum wage.
They continue to demand the training of unions in the Fast-Food-Branche.
The U.S. law prohibits the management of the company to stand this goal and to remedy or dismiss unions.
On the other hand, the management of the company doesn't make it easy to them.
However, the creation of unions in the Fast-Food-Branch is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high personal fluctuation.
Relaxed
Noble tests were also made today before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting in the afternoon before the McDonald's at Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, including the Member of the City Council of Jumane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it selling billions of portions, and yet you don't give you sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work!"
The demons were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food employees so that they can receive a fair reward and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to New York Times, this was the largest action of her kind in the history of the fast-food industry in America.
However, only a few hundred people locally, from which are not all involved in the Fast-Food-Branch, in which tens of thousands work in New York.
Still, the radio of these protests will not be able to mobilize whole masses.
"The brain can only be moderately overlisted"
The theme of enlarged reality for followers of modern technologies is usually observed by the lense of a special brille.
At the first time, Google presented a working model at his annual conference in the summer, in November, it was known that Microsoft had also registered an appropriate patent.
In the conversation with the Head of the Group of Interactive 3D Technologys in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it is clear that the brille for the company’s scientists was only a passing station.
It irritates the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with mere hands and creating virtual free spaces.
- Please describe what research your group is doing.
- We are concerned with the interaction of humans and machinery, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, the humanity has remained largely in the phase, in which pixels are worked on flat screens that are sometimes affected.
However, we want to look forward to 5-10 years and see the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a progress, and today no more Xbox will be sold without Kinect as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What do we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction on a physical level, many still play on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been crucial.
We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional presentation systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make them more fascinating.
However, it is necessary that not only the users, but also its environment is recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these shattered virtual-reality wholems!
What do you think about linguistic control?
She's popular, but isn't she overvalued?
- Surely it is not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because not always you would like to inform all the surroundings about his actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but every one in their specific niche.
For example, in the field of control of objects on public places, we worked at a project where we experimented with short and tangible, rather than with outloading gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bone and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but theoretical could be reduced to the size of a bracelet clock.
But the future, however, belongs to mixed control types, such as getics and language.
- How?
For example, we would ask you to reach you this mudosis?
They say it and at the same time suggest it.
- Usually, I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- Does this you want the user to adapt to what a machine can make at the same time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but there's a mutual approach here.
I think that in the next time we have to work mainly on the development of new sensor types, which enables people's reactions more precisely.
For example, this can be laser sensors, as they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What claims do you ask from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors to modern cameras?
Does it lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
So all current technologies are not good enough for us because the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and the Y, but also along the Z axes.
Also the speed and number of images per second are important.
The human movements are extremely dynamic and openly said, the current 30 fps are too little for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our laboratory at Redmond with a regulable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much this affects the interaction of human and machine.
For my work, I just needed such a device, only without touch control and with more pictures per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be raised?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", one of them is actually an infrared channel and the second is a recipient for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It does not serve to calculate the object depth.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem as more calculations would be necessary.
Beautiful would be a flexible Kinect-like system, with which we could play with different cameras in order to determine how this helps us to identify a position in three dimensions.
- If I quite remember, Microsoft did not present the public in contrast to Google's brille.
Do you not think that the brille has the best prospects for the use of the technology of enlarged reality in everyday life?
- Of course it is not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in the lift, but I think the most great variant would be a "changing" enlarged reality in which we could switch over a cloud from the brille to the smartphone,
The brille is a personal gadget and its strength (Privates can only see you), but at the same time also their weakness, as an extended reality by Brille prevents you to work together with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only Tony Stark from Iron Man but also normal mortality.
There is a problem to frequently point to the critic of this idea: there is no sensitive reaction!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers do your group want to give on this effort?
- In my lectures, I often speak that the extended reality represents the seventh breakthrough in interaction between human and machine.
I think the eighth break could be the integration of tactile perception.
A interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as an unusual projection document.
She's taking a great deal of pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at lending the "pictures in the air" a little handfire, for example, the interference of some oriented ultrasound beams in a certain point, where the finger is, a feeling that is still so weak, as a splendid one over the balls.
There are also bands for the handwheel that affect the nervous missions in the fingers, including that is a potential direction.
- Did you try to overcome the brain?
Let us think it feels what it should feel if it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
There is another task that we will have to fight for a long time, namely a person who is physically in a closed room, to believe it is in an open, practical infinite room; here we work in concepts with walking bands (other than in fitness studios), moving platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be overlist moderately, and there are still many years before us.
This makes the work in the area of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: For many topics, we are first at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", dedicated to the city residents who form the avantgard of art and culture.
On the list of readers, high-level representatives of the Petersburg Art scene have already landed, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
Rosbalt's new hero is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the beards dressed in red, which can be attracted at the Russian museum, at the summer garden, at scenes or on memories.
Whereever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they are locking large human masses.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburgian social-philosophy artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg Avantgard end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s.
He is also a man of the city and ventilated by his presence on the street of his fellow citizens a smile in the face and provides good laune for them.
Shortly before he drew up a rotor and became a player of the Petersburg rotor, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in his artist, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or doorkis in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer, which is interfering with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the grunorm calls out aggressions and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to become painters?
- In an exhibition at the Cultural Palace Newskij, where my work was postponed.
I realized that I have to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters ended at that time, and new and free painters like I were indispensable.
I was friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina", which came to "Puschkinskaja 10", and then was only concluded.
I draw it to theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything except the literature.
And all this united in your art clinic... - It was important to stand in the centre of the Petersburg culture where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and until the renovation work, there was a musical artistic club for the bombs, the house of the Petersburg Bohemy.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how snur came with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to the playback, wore close trikots and also heard the composer Igor Wdowin today.
When the group started playing live, it became from her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the foundations he learned with us.
The gallery "D 137" or "Griboedov" also originates in the art clinic.
Then our employees and family guests went there.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was an survey in the press on which the award was "personalities of our city".
I won the category "Artists of the Year", and so I was at the highest point.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In today, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without providing a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the actuality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier, I was social, but now it hurts, and I'm afraid to be like that.
In a clown, all this fades and loses his tragedy.
I love the Great, and I have great ideas.
For example, we turn out the world by prescribing that everyone has to be totally harmed.
Now everyone pays attention to clothing and focusing on the outer and not on the inside of the human being.
But maybe one should not give a man the hand, but should spit in his face.
The delusion disappears through the complaint.
A cultural city should have a hero.
Who if I don't?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Today, commercial art must be careful, prudent and glamorous.
We see the fall of cultures.
Earlier, the people formed large groups: The Bohemians loved the One and the simple people the other.
Now there are micro-Communitys, and it is difficult to please all of them.
I'm not a hundred dollar note that likes everyone.
Now you have to think who you're going to like.
Now every cultstar has about 100 followers.
But there's several thousand to the appearances of St. Michailow!
- He's coming out of his wife, and the sexual social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and everything goes under.
I have followers, and the most important is not to betray them and not to destroy it.
In my youth I painted such pictures, even in a series of works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually come at the end of the career.
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
It says: spiritual culture and consumption culture.
Consumer has no culture, that's something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what does Petersburg miss?
- Good cultural experts.
You say, ministers of culture.
But not everyone of them can deal with culture.
With the real Zaren it was different, because the Zaren may not understand much of culture, but they understood that the right experts are necessary.
In Moscow there are currently good consultants.
In Petersburg we have those who could be the experts, but they will be locked out the way, as it needs high-level experts who correctly evaluate the first and free the way to them.
Now is only the own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters need to search for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; there is much more culture and a corresponding nutritional floor in Moscow.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural nutritional floor, for for example we now have more writers than readers, and that is not the right thing.
There are many curious people in Europe who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us this is much less.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the previous century.
The project is financed from grants of the city of Sankt Petersburg
Birthday in the world all
Earth in danger.
Heating or collapse with Killerasteroid.
Caravans of space ships with earthquakes on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, is the important question of how we can continue on the earthquake or on the substitute planet?
There are many options for selection that I do not think.
The facto is only two real planets that we can live at least hypothetic.
"Noble Mars and Venus," says scientists of the Astronomian Starberg Institute Wladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparable to life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the Venus surface.
Life would only be possible in a large height or in the runway of the Venus, i.e. in the All.
The question of continuation in the world first discussed the researchers with regard to Flora.
Experiences with plants have been carried out before a half a century.
The fourth generation of the in orbited heritages did not differ in the least of the earthly species.
It followed the insect insects, more precisely from tiny fruit flyings (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, waiteleiers were sent to the world to research how seriousness affects the development of embryos.
It develops a very normal cow.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the cow must find hold; it must stand on his legs and start moving," explains the laboratory manager of the Institute of Medical-biological Problems RAN, Wladimir Sychew.
Without firm underground, the chickens are wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns totally aborted.
The chickens did not respond to light and loud.
Then, four days later, they just died.
"Twice we let kuikens smuggle and then put it all in, because it is simply impossible to work with them," Wladimir Sychew observes the failed experiment with the cows in all.
The last cheese with animals floated 16 years ago in the orbit.
In spring 2013 the experiments are continued.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only equally sexual species.
There was an experiment with rats that have been sent to all.
In principle, there was nothing special to do with this.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was only a single experiment, and research has to be continued," said Wladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the World Space Councils received new adults.
The problems of reproduction directly in the space could not be solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are cut out of their natural habitat can simply not follow their reproduction drive.
In contrast to animals, humans could have the principle.
The homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can generate a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
But women have been flying to all for 50 years.
The largest risk was at Tereschkova.
The most valuable that mankind has is the female organism.
Our moons flog from it, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it exceed the space flight?
Can she bring a child to the world after this flight?
"But nobody answered this question," says Space Veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonautin, Valentina Tereschkova, was born a daughter.
The father of the child, Andryan Nikolajew, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in the All, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in the orbit and even worked outside the space vehicle, was a son.
Still, there's a risk.
We have only very few cosmonauts, with which after long flights everything went well and got them healthy infants.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even in the orbit flights," concluded Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, mankind has to search for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravitation.
The hydrolaboratorium in the Cosmonauten preparation centre is a mandatory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a state of silence, the cosmonaut routine wins for work in the open space.
The water represents severity.
Even if adults feel water as pleasant, it is a strange environment; yet, sisters feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ektyander witnessed that life in the country came from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that a child is located in the mother’s stomach in fruit water about 9 months, and that it can then be more easily used on water.
In principle, this is logical because from birth to first swimming just two weeks pass away.
"That's too little time to forget something," says baby swim teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While a newborn child is a much more natural condition, the woman is not without weakness.
In the state of gravitation, the abdominal and Becken music is quite rapidly reduced and thus also reduces the ability to express the child.
Well, we're dealing with the means of birth-induction.
For example, the birth could take place in a special chamber to express the child.
"But what happens then?" is the unusual question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial heavy force.
Without feeling of dancing, organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a load in the orbit as a adult for training.
He will simply miss what is of elementary importance for his life.
"This experiment that we jointly make, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to us bringing a disabled person, a perfectly inappropriate people to the world," the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow, says.
So far, the birth of children in the world is mere theory.
But somehow, it will be reality when the earthquake in her space ships break up to a remote planet that will become the home for her seeds born in the world.
NKU-Chef: Control of the Black System is failing by policy debts
The Czech Republic has good control agencies and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but it shall fall in their application.
In the conversation for Acktuálně.cz, this is the Vice President of the Supreme Control Office (Newvyší controlní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied properly - and this is, I think, not the case with us", commentes Kala the current situation.
A similar result seems also to be a common control by Czech and German auditor.
As a negative example, he launches the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "Schwarz-System".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS wouldn't harm the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited then cannot simply come to the President of the government, and the control office, whose obligation is now the control of compliance with the law, impedes in his activity," notes Kala.
At the meeting of the Board of Auditors, you talked about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries were compared with public contracts.
Where was it concrete?
This is a parallel test that we have started about two years ago.
Simplifiedly said, it is about the European Legislative to define how to handle public contracts, to build up national legislation, and finally there is still the actual practical application.
All of this we compared, and although the test is not yet completed, we could find extremely interesting differences. Generally, the laws are perhaps even something more "strenger and more perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules, and it is also necessary to address the actual application of the law.
How can you help the project? What is for you from this project?
Such a common control could help us stop continually trying to perfect the laws and reduce and distortion of thresholds if this seems to be a very positive effect.
Economicity means obtaining a matter at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and exclusion of unlawful sectoring or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we achieve this objective too.
Perhaps it is even so that we only load the system in this way with excessive " Paper Kram", and those looking for the holes in the system have much easier to use the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech law of procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority like our NKU, or does the system work differently?
As regards the authorities, the German Pendant is the NKU of the Bundesrechnung Court, which is similar to us and also has a collaboration that is only formed different, but both authorities are working similarly.
The competences are also comparable to some degrees, but Germany is a state of state, i.e. that this accounting offices are also available in the individual states - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH is only allowed to control federal resources that correspond to our State funds.
Public means managed by the districts and municipalities are there subject to control of the national accounting offices.
What the German legislation is the simpler than ours?
In general, I would only compare this without any specific information, but in some respect, Germany is often a model, but it is unlikely to say that Germany is better in everything.
Does that mean that the testers are better there?
That doesn't mean, but as said, I don't really like these comparisons.
It is still noted that those countries who are a example also have problems to fight for us.
Otherwise, they would not have any cooperation with our authority, do they?
As regards Czech legislation, what significance has been made for your authority to renovate the contract law, do you have any effect?
In view of the fact that this novella is in force only a short period of time, it does not have our tests yet.
Since our controls are carried out afterwards, you must expect some delay here.
In the preparatory phase of future checks, we have introduced the new control instrument "Revision of the Uneconomic Risks" and analysed and analysed with this almost 14.000 public contracts - these changes are naturally affected, as the thresholds are changing, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positively, or will the system be charged with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and hope that this adoption is confirmed.
However, the problem may occur that the rules are "strenger" and can no longer be maintained.
Under the previous rules, the testing subject to the carrier (e.g. in the event of an operational regional policy programme, the Regional Council) shall be recognising that any non-containing of the contract law corresponds to infringement of the budgetary discipline.
But is it beneficial to make the law even more stringent?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First of all, let's say the way that is not targeting.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not illuminate the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "Schwarz System" - what does that mean exactly?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, it cannot simply be the President of the government, and the control office, whose obligation is now the control of compliance with the law, can be impeded in his activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we're doing as if nothing was.
The contract law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions, and that is correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is tragic if the beekeeper is excluded with the best offer alone because of form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what I believe is missing with us.
On the streets there is individual ice glass, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of Czechia, there is partly snow and ice glasses.
Most of all, the streets are well ridiculous, sometimes increased caution.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the Karlsbad District, the streets were well driven today morning, individually snow and ice glass.
The temperatures sank to -5 to -10 °C, over the day it should be somewhat warmer.
In the region it no longer cuts, and in the deeper heights it remains just a thin snow cover.
On the cages of the arch mountain, however, there are about 30 cm of snow.
According to the District Road Guard, Nebel's restricted views occurred.
The highway R6 and the roadways of the first street class in the region are currently unlimited.
However, attention should be given to bridges where the roads are at times required and smooth.
At the same time, all roads of the second and third street class, including the mountain roads, are driving.
However, on these roads, sectionally required or excited snow retreats.
In particular, in higher positions, increased attention is required.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets of Eastbows there is danger of ice glass, in higher locations and in the mountains is still an excited snow layer on the streets, and the road and autobahn directory shares on their websites.
The road championships warn drivers from ice glass, which can occur in particular in higher locations in the Pardubice district.
The ice glass can come to the Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto in particular for roadways of the second and third street class.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is particularly located on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the Mount Orlické hoory.
A excited snow history is located on the streets of the Rychnov circles, nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
It is predominantly sunny or heated today in Eastbomen, and it remains largely precipitation.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen District
The streets in the Pilsen district are well driven today but locally increased attention is required, and the route is adjustable to the weather.
This is frowned in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
As it had been cutting before and the temperatures later fell, it can come to ice glasses on the streets.
In the public, it is also possible to look at nebula, but the view will improve in the day’s course.
These figures are from the district street masterships.
The D5 car is virtually infinite, but increased attention recommends road championships between 80 and 131 km.
The tracks of the first street class are mainly dry, but frozen.
However, in the south of the circles of Pilsen and Tachov it can be partly to ice glasses.
The roadways of the second and third road class are moisture, and therefore there is also the reference to possible sections.
Drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequent roads in Böhmerwald.
Olomouc District
With snow mash today, drivers have to expect to go towards the heights of the Olomouc district.
After the use of scatter vehicles, snowmatch remains on the Pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the street towards Videlský kříž.
Nightly snow drive forced street masterships to be used, in the Šumperk circle, according to road management, about 3 cm new snow fell.
In the other areas of the district, the roadways are usually unlimited.
"In the district of Šumperk, snow remains in the heights.
At the Pass Červenohorské sedlo the drivers have to expect to look towards Jeseník with snowmatsch," said a road management employer Šumperk today compared to the ČTK Agency.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to find out the night, according to their information, the streets are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are inevitable, but in the district of Šternberk the drivers have to be careful to drive in forest sections, as the roads are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem District Liberec
In northernbomen, road championships report several badly driven street sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice glass, the mountain road from Telnice is locked to Knínice in the Ustí n.K. according to information of the transport policy.
The temperatures remain in deeper locations below zero, so that snow and ice will be kept on the streets. There are no problems reported from the depth levels, especially south-east of the bohemian central mountain, and the streets are usually dry there.
No traffic disorders have been reported.
Iron glass is reported in particular by the Štětí surround.
According to meteorologists there were ideal conditions for this night - over rain and smelling snow, in the night cloudless heaven and Frost.
From the main routes and from the road I/13 at the border of the districts Ustí n.L. and Liberec are reported poor traffic conditions.
The road locking between Telnice and Knínice was necessary because of ostes that were pressed from the snowlast to the road.
Šimon Ornest: On our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think should take place in less than a month of the end of the world?
This is one of those disaster messages that we like to jump people.
With our band The Tap Tap, we make fun about it and say that we are the only band of the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the fall of the world.
In December you can also realise a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you imagine the project closer to our readers?
It is a country-wide beneficiary event that we are planning for two years.
To this end, we want to use the sales potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is pregnant at 11:10 a.m. for 21 December.
On the day before, i.e. on December 20, there are three concerts at the same time in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts should be in about the time at which the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific Island of Kiribati, which is at a time zone of 12 hours before us.
Who's from?
Originally from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic Honza Augusta.
We do not only want to collect sufficiently positive energy to prevent the fall of the world, but we also want to think about it together with the public, in which state we depart from this world once our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-Shirts, bags and key hangers against the world undergoing, with which people can also support us via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap has also taken up the so-called hymn against the world falling with the title "Worlddown".
Even today, the hymn is very popular on YouTube. Will she also get to the beneficiary concerts?
Of course, and at the end, assured that everything works and does not take place in the fall of the world...
The hymn should be sung at the same time by all artists on all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns are transferred live together in a direct cease from the Czech television.
The text of the hymn is from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with further personalities of the Czech culture scene, which involves realizing many benefit events and concerts...
We strive to intensify these people into our projects.
It has shown that most of us are interested in cooperation and enjoy it.
What is the purpose of the dissolution of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of Studeo's accessible educational centre, we have been working together with the Tap association in the Jedlička Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly managed by lecturers who help them in various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to seek the lecturers, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a private building in which we then enter with this project.
There are several groups and artists in each concert.
After what criteria did you select these?
We wanted to compile a programme that addresses all generations including children.
For example, in Prague Chinaski, Support Lesbies, Illustratesphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Searchý.
Find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" also planned for the future?
For the first time in May we arrive at the Prague Spring, and we also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year we would like to enter into the Czech house in New York, and I personally - if we are in the United States - would also like to connect this with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not just small until you have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you handle these trips logistic and organisational?
It's not as bad as it appears at first view.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room, and we also need to join many instrument bags and other bags...
It has always been in trouble until now, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that sometimes I have already been surprised at times.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
By your foreign trips, you have a comparison of how it looks like accessibility in the individual countries, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you ever experienced these things?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than with us, we were just in Russia’s Witnesses of the fact that in the east, everything is still in its beginnings.
Moscow is absolutely unsuitable against Prague. There is still unusual when someone is on the wheelchair alone in the centre of the city.
It is not even natural there that you prefer a wheelchair rider, for example, in the lift.
Fortunately, there are associations that try to add to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respect should we get to the further developed countries?
There are many more things we hang behind...
However, it is still noted that improvement of the situation depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common that people with severe disabilities can also move themselves in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not only common that there is a larger group of disabled people actively involved in the social event, in which we are a little advanced with the band The Tap Tap the West!
Respect in the public and accessibility is a matter, but only when from our series of important sporters, artists, actors, politicians, or lawyers come, things will really begin to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly desirable personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. However, if we go back a few years: What did you motivate in 1998 to form a band?
At that time, I started as a maintainer in the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in getting involved in something intense.
And since I myself am musician and, for example, play saxofon, I founded a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and with the time it is, as our Moderator, Lářa Angelovič, to say, something out of control (laughter).
But the band became known only in recent years, or do I mislead?
It is true that cooperation with well-known singers has helped us, and we also have started to act actively for us.
We have become aware that if you are doing something and not seeing this outward, your own performance does not exist in some sense.
Thanks to the EU funds, we can also afford good lecturers, high-quality devices and other things.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that you can make things different.
In the showbusiness today, one of the others is often copying.
This is logic in his way, since everything is viewed new with caution and is only accepted after a longer time.
There are just a few really unique things, and I'm waiting to claim that Dad's part of it.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is naturally compassionate; this is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely excessive because people with disabilities are not a lonely and abandoned beings that we need to regret.
There are people who can live and develop their lives, if they have the necessary means.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed something, this is not only a progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it helpful for this success that you are a strict boss as you hear of many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not go into compromise in many things and also need a certain discipline.
This is, however, totally normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they then find that they have twice the week's samples, have to finish preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm gets fast.
This way, however, works everywhere, in every band that works seriously and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has 20 members.
How many of them were from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one one: Lářa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go, and you can't prevent that.
Whoever has the will and desires to participate is always welcome with us.
Finds out instead of the day before the prognosted world entry, Thursday at 21 a.m. on Thursday, 20 a.m.
Events are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostriva; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
The band The Tap Tap is a joint interpretation of the Hymne World Teaching.
The concert aims to create the means for the facilities of a multifunctional disabled educational centre, which should be created in Prague under the name STUDEO in the Jedlička Institute. Cost point: 25 million CZK
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free, cards are available in advance sales at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland was taken as a twentyth member of this space authority at a Council of Ministers of the European Space Organization of the ESA, which is the second member of the former East Block (after the Czech Republic, which was member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The way of Poland in the space began freely much earlier.
Already before World War II, Polish cosmos spoiled with space riding, not always encountered understanding.
For example, I remember the lecture of A. Šternfeld of December 6th, 1933, at the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneer work "Ingang to Cosmonautic".
But the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) were cold, and after years, Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important defender of the astronomy and space ride.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books about these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldwide recognised contribution to the development of space travel was deemed, among other things, that one of the crater was named after him on the earthquake side of the moon.
In 1925, a railway drain was built in Poland for which a rocket drive was planned.
The author of the design and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or brake the draisine.
The information to be provided is exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with raket-fired ships.
The research work led the Institute of Comórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents delivered, it is obvious that research was carried out until the stage of practical tests.
The research was then freely interrupted by the inmars of the German war force.
In 1937, in the expert press, the design of a photoelectric huntraket, which is founded by Ing. Rohozićski, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects discussed the military use of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects were coordinated for military use by the previous scientific consultative committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity, his work was completed from the outset of war.
Further articles on space travel appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this society takes place in 1954 in the November issue of the issue of Problemy, which is dedicated to four extensive articles of space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At the time there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was thought that the research of the space would have future.
At its beginning in 1956, Polish Space Society PTA tried to join the International Federation for Space and, in fact, the PTA became a member of the early autumn 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), chairman of the International Federation for Space.
This office was in 1959 until his death.
Since 1956, PTA has been significantly involved in the development of the extremely successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and was not totally 5 kg.
Later a improved version was built, the RM-1A, and in 1959 fly tests began with the two-level RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another development level should already be able to make real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach a flight height of up to 14,5 km and be used for monitoring high winds.
In 1962, however, further development was set up.
Follower of the first rockets of the type RM, the Meteor-1-Rakete developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-level tract, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Of this rocket, three types were developed (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which are different from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A racket has a transport room with 0.4 litres of replacement capacity, Meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height was 37 km from all three types.
In 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rackete was developed in the airline institute, whose first flight tests started in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a 10 kg operating fee to a height of about 60 km.
The versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were then built.
In 1960, the accession to Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) is also noted that two years later the establishment of a National COSPAR Committee was followed.
Poland participated in the Interkosmos programme also in the world space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski was after the Czech Vladimír Remek second intercosmonaut.
The withdrawal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court raised the law on non-profit work.
This decision highlighted a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to consider the problem from a wider perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
This is why the principle of free trade and free, unlimited movement of private capital, which is handed in hand with unreachable financial speculations.
As a result of the large differences in the value of work (lons) price voltages.
Under this term, a condition is to be understood where the manufacturer tries to stand by importing cheap goods in economic competition by providing the competition "induced" in order to break a larger market share in itself and increase its profit.
In the large scale, this means for most companies to shift their production abroad or buy them cheaply, or to give up their business, and the result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital is not responsible for social and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, state expenditure is essentially increasing.
This situation will still be strengthened by the fact that men are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus replace the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics are overflowed at this point.
The unreasonable practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies where governments are obliged to join competition in order to reduce the social level of their own population artificially and thus lock foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population without prejudice to social consequences to private capital.
This is particularly expressed in amendments to the laws applicable.
These measures aim to force their own population to accept the dictate of private capital in particular in the wage sector.
This happens to one by economic forces in long-term unemployment, and, on the other, by cutting workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between poor and rich.
In Germany there have been a number of years of public food taxes for arms that are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people concerned already goes into the millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regularly cases where workers receive such a minor wage that the State must increase their income to the existing minimum.
One such scandal was also discovered in the case of aid forces engaged in the German Bundestag.
The saving measures practically all EU-South States will undoubtedly extend to the same condition in which people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophe of their social level (like the case in the 19th century), or for a hunger wage on the edge of the society and hope that some time private investment capital will be flown into the country.
It is naturally the question of where this capital comes?
If it comes from another EU country, it is only the poverty of one country to another; or capital remains the same as that in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Africa, the employees are working for a fraction of European wages.
This is the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the State should not participate in its own economy and that plan economy leads to economic catastrophe.
The private capital is closely persuaded by its view that the State is not allowed to enter into the economy.
But then you have to ask if the private capital does not affect or guide the policy and thus the whole state in their own self-egoistic sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence is the existence of a practical almighty and lobby in all countries.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the mutual prevention, a legislation, in which practically everything is stressful, but nothing penalty.
In Germany, the situation is so that a government ministries are inadequately private, close to the industry, with the drafting of laws.
These laws are then adopted on the Bundestag.
All violence will then not go out of the people, as it proclaims the Western Constitutions, but of strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Clearly, the liberal democracies are now rapidly in a situation as they describe Appian in his work to the crisis of the Roman Republic at times Cäsar and Pompeius: "The state has long been in destruction, and the offices were occupied with violence.
Against Schmiergeld, by unlawful sliding of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew upless, and the people had no consul with already purchased voices for elections" ... "man with character did not acquire for officers, so that the state had no consul due to this defeat for eight months" ... "you already began to talk about that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a single rule, and that a strong man should be chosen"... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who was permanently replaced by democracy by the alone rule.
As shown, today’s society is just as well as in ancient times based on the unreasonable preference of its own advantage without respect for overall social interests.
The private capital is not already able from its nature to identify and implement the advantage for the whole society.
Today, as is the result, is an unprecedented decadency of the elites who are not trying to make deeper reforms.
The cause for the appearance of fascism and Communism is therefore to look for in the unreasonable liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
From today’s state, the decline of these regimes can be regarded as a certain break in liberal democracy, with which the next round is already acknowledged.
Especially catastrophe is the fact that today's elites are the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of human life, humanitarian and social disasters, whose witnesses we are already today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the older and newer history, in a perfect ignorance.
The withdrawal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution here, at least no permanent.
The pressure of global and European economic competition will be forced to continue searching for ways in order to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore system-resistant.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase capital participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopolarisation of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Chaos laboratory.
"... that nothing is from violence, or could ever arise" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain is: "... so that we don't forget how cruel we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, it would be no," says the dying Goodle Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, there was, as always, a number of reactions.
One stands behind Israel and argues with its right to self-defense while they call the Palestinians as terrorists; others are in turn supporting Palestinians, arguing with the racism of the Israeli state, with which the peoples of Palestinian Arabs are committed and called the State of Israel as terrorist.
I do not want to write on this point who has been born into the current political situation and has not experienced the beginning of violence.
I am going to open the readers the view behind the scenes, the glance of who's the 95 years of tension (at the end of the Balfour declaration in November 1917) in the small spots of land in the Middle East are most important.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are distracted from these and out of my own understanding, who or what group of people affects the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of battle for power.
In every epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What seems to be less augenable is the question whether it was always these personalities, which have been autonomous to their steps, or that behind their throne, someone who led their actions to a predetermined goal.
We need to see that we live in a time when the world's wealth focuses on fewer individuals in hand and that this concentration of money and its power has not created within the lifespan of a generation.
Among these astronomical rich families, one specially highlights that could be called as the head of the crake (I don't know whether someone else is over them, but I don't quit this) - the Rothschilds.
Very much is not written about her.
Conspicuously.
The first press agency (Reuters) was already purchased by the Rothschild in the nineties of the 19th century, in order to interfere with their name with highly criminal acts, in whose background always stands the fortification of their power, the increase of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the Central Banks, they are wars or are on these (before the attack on Afghanistan, 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were five countries after the Sturz Ghaddafis remained only four, with Russia in the meantime its central bank of the Russian government).
Anyone who has always tried to counteract this family had to pay for this life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began during the civil war to release its own (speak: state) banknotes and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to release its own banknotes and wanted to make the FED - he was murdered in 1963; Mr Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to complain the FED for the solution of the world economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the world's powers of the Rothschild led to the formulation of a plan for the defeat of three wars by Albert Piik, a Friday of 33, and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the large monarchist states of Europe, by the second war, the British colonial rule should be broken, and the third war should reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (a number of people would provide for their amenities and their luxury and would also not use as many resources), a universal religion (the ecomenism is nothing more than the premise) and finally lead to the adoption of absolute power.
The method with which the group of richest families working with the Rothschilds at the top is the solution of a crisis and the next offer of a solution (order from chao - order from the chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the founding of the FED, so that crises such as those caused by them in 1907 do not repeat).
After the murder of the Habsburg Thronfolger Ferdinand in Sarajevo managed to dissolve the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Zarenreich by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The first world war ended with the sudden, military and unfounded capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Zarenreich the war was no longer necessary), then the resolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Ungarns took place.
In order to facilitate the second world war, the bankers made a latente conflict situation by making Germany more easy with gigantic war repairs; thus they created the prerequisite of armed masses, so that they only had to undermine the Germans a sufficient strong leader who offered the guilt-named and simple solutions; a further factor was the creation of the Viel-Folctor State of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that would have to take the function of a fifth column and also taken in order to simplify the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement in which a branch aimed to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned already created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to first collapses with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The second world war broke out, and if Hitler now loses from the chain where the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything went on by plan, it is only difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as was prepared by the war repairs against Germany on the ground for the Second World War, the excerptation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the burning point for the Third World War.
When the international bankers are able to escape this war, the Jewish people will become a victim in the frontern warline, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laborator, a source of dispute and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (man thinks only how sharp the people are divided into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only triggers wrong in an endless spiral of violence, in the beginning the Gier individuals and their pursuits of global power?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel as well as with us, the people, have only their own candidates to choose.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-sufficient, loyal to international bankers who are doing everything to simplify a war with Iran, which could quickly extend to a global conflict in view of Iran's membership in the singhaier organization for cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), and in which it could come to a destruction of the world economy because of Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide road of Hormus, which runs 20% of the global oil supplies.
In what light the words David Rockefellers from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is a surprising crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In her idea, the new world order is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristokrates.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth a chip to subject this being of total control.
"And it makes that the little and the Great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all the time give themselves a painting to their right hand or to their forehead that no one can buy or sell, he has the painting, namely the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! Who has understanding, who overleads the number of animals.
For it is a human number, and his number is six hundred six and sixty-seven."
The film argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Teheran and took 52 diplomats as a hostage.
For their release, they demanded the delivery of the crashed shahs Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution into the United States, who had kept the patronate over his regime for decades.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford to throw the shah over board, since this would have damaged the confidence of her bonds in other countries.
At the same time, she was not able to implement the release of the hosts in Iran, where the revolution was in the introduction of a theocratic regime.
It was a heavy hit for the reputation of the unified States, and the then Fiasko in the violent attempt of hostile liberation made everything even worse.
The engaged diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations were provided by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages called for a wave of solidarity and anti-iranal mood at home.
The debakel in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carters defeat against Ronald Reagan in the presidency elections in 1980.
The film argo of the director and actress Ben Affleck describes a episode of this story, which made the United States a little participating.
Soon before the composition of the message, six embassy employees have flew.
These ends after numerous complications in the Residenz of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA succeeded in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring refugees out of Iran, with an extravagant story that helped them to cover their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passes as members of a filmstabe, who were supposedly visited in the country for a science Fiction film.
Combination of Genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required the collaboration of Hollywoods.
To ensure that the tariff was believed, articles on this film project appeared in special journals, press conferences were held, and the phyctive production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept in secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of multiple film generators.
On the one hand, he is a realistic polit Thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the history of a successful Husar piece like the Film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the voting levels in the film - one side of which the documentary scenes from Teheran (in the sequence of titles are shown iconic contemporary photographs, and there are no major differences in the film recording of the same situations).
On the other hand, the more locked passages from Hollywood, which are ironic and easily oversplits.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA centre and other institutions - men in attractions on the contact table, on the boards, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to re-establish his career with this film.
He has become a respectable director, and also as a actress, he is no longer the goal of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third game film after Krimi No children's game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without grace (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film that does not play in the heimful Boston of the director.
The feeling of the atmosphere of the place was among the features that elevated the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
But this feeling also proves in Argo where Teheran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the return sequence of the firstäming of the message is very impressive in its overview, and nevertheless gives the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the history is moving anywhere.
A similar effect also achieves afleck with its team in scenic scenes (the wrong film tab on a basar in Teheran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to focus on the fact that history does not actually offer many exciting scenes in filmic sense.
However, he works quite successful, sometimes following the reality - what does not always work so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis on the airport in Teheran is deployed by a telephoneat in America, or also the persecution hunting on the train, acts something.)
The weakness of Argo is its all too wide scatter, which is due to the need to show too much in action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures have earned more space, and so they are not very alone in the film.
It is a film that can be tracked with some interest and the design and the retro style of a thriller in the 70th year.
But enthusiasm is just awakening difficulty.
However, as a reminder of an almighty history until today, and as a evidence of how the ideas of the Almighty and Knowledge Secret Services are overthrown, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for the blast of airballons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who annually calls for a survey of the most absurd bank fees, decided this year to commit the competition of "decisive regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"On this idea, the last plan of the EU to introduce a rate of 40% of women in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who is about the organization of this survey, to the Právo newspaper.
For example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the uniformization of the insurance rates for men and women is among the nominated asurances.
Until then, women benefited from life insurance because they were objectively lower risks for insurance companies.
"More incredible accidents from the EU workshop can be nominated until the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," afterwards.
The controversial EU regulations include, for example, the binding contingency of bioethanol to fuels that are naturally harmful in their consequences, the further ban on the reliable quack-silver-thermometer, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or also the Directive on the size of chickens due to which eggs have been more expensive in this year.
In the past, criticism also appointed the faktic prohibition of the use of the term "bodies" or the prohibition of sales for conventional gloves.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU equipment often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose claims in Brussels are usually represented by one or more Member States (e.g. the Czech Republic is trying to implement the claims of Czech banks with veto threat).
Lobby interests also found that bananas must be at least 14 cm long in the EU and do not have to show "crumming anomaly".
The European Commission defended the argument that it would only harmonise the unitary national standards that would hinder trade.
The EU's standards on fruit and vegetables have already been resisted by some countries with the indication that the previous directives would lead to a loss of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which must be provided in accordance with airballons when selling with the indication that children under eight years are not allowed to blame the airballon without supervision of adults.
The EU is referring to an American study, which, according to airballons, is the leading cause for children's death of diagnosis.
A similar limitation is already applicable for children up to 14 years in the use of annual market floods.
Kuriose accidents are also at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns European officials themselves - everyone who accepts an official function in the EU may not use Macedonia's name for the sensitivity of Greece and must rather say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated, in cooperation with the association of liberal economist Laissez Faire, in addition to the EU regulation on the scope of food resources in the field of a Member State.
The EU therefore established the maximum volume of food supplies that were allowed on the day of our EU accession in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeded the volume set for Pilz conservation, for example, which threatened a high fine penalty for us.
The organisations of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for having no sea, or from the idea of giving funding fees for funding fees.
These ideas were not from Brussels but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by having no sea.
We will request refunds in the EU," said in autumn 2004 the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As an argument, he claimed that the cereal harvest was very high and the government camps were overfilled by the so-called intervention purchases.
As Czechia has a further way to sea ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of million euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally reached Czech Republic so far that they organized an instruction on the purchase of cereals from countries that have no access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, under the leadership of Minister Pavel Němec (USA) for Procurement Deposits for Funding Deposits, gave the municipalities to the Ministry of Regional Development, concretely awarded the Commission to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
However, regulations will easily be made to the target of criticism, the EU's efforts for regulation and thus also to achieve effectiveness and development of the whole European Union, according to some experts.
A more serious problem is, according to these experts, the EU funding funds for projects that have not been common with the deepening of European integration but were forced in the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also highlight that Czech Republic must fight the right to use specific labels of traditional products and not always win this fight.
However, after a six-year fight with Germany and Austria, Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvaržky", the Inlandrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition has returned to us until the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename to "Tuzemák".
The name Rum may only be used for products made of sugar tube silicone, not for products made of sugar boilers.
In the official list of the products registered in the EU, the Society of the world’s famous cheese varieties feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipan or the Parmaschinken also open the Karlsbader Zwieback, carpfs from Pohořelice and Tadhramebo, or also the Saazer Hopfen.
With a EU brand, the pardubic liver can breach itself or the Hořic roles.
"The people want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an assassin," said Okamura.
Mr Senator, what is the idea of communicating for the President's office?
I don't want to be senator or president.
If everything would work without problems in our country, I wouldn't be able to do anything else.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves run freely around, while people are increasing taxes and pension ages.
I had no ambitions to become politicians.
But if I see something that does not like me, then I try to introduce a solution to change this.
And since I have been over 40, and in this way independently and unpartly, I have no other opportunity to influence things than to communicate for the office of a senator or President.
In the senate you did it and then make yourself on the way to the castle.
Do you not get your voters the back?
I told me all the time that I would take up the battle around the castle after the result of the senat elections.
Later I clarified this and said that I will be able to see the President's office, provided that I will be elected to the senator.
My goal is not the function. The function is an instrument that I can realise my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and as possible a mandate.
However, the difficulty is not only to simplify as a people in the knee and before the television, but to defeat everyone who wants to change something.
In this way, the media wanting to rob one of the honour, and those who are going to lie with freedom to lie.
For example, I was claimed that I would order journalists or that I was advisor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have taken up the battle around the castle with the These of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with repealing assets statements over 20 million crowns.
You need to change laws.
As President, you do not have any competence in this respect, and only the senate as a whole can introduce legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have used the travel leader to stay a free industry, and this could be carried through.
The problem is the small-sized policy - when someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it will be deliberately rejected, and it is only the population.
As an independent party, I am bound by a far greater potential to gain support for all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without a shot thinking and party ideas from every party.
Do you look like a man in politics rather right or left?
From Czech point of view, I think people see me left.
For me this right-hand cover is totally unreasonable.
For me, it is important that we continue.
I don't care if someone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to connect people.
I will only publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn to bad ideas.
It misss you when someone calls you as populists.
But do you not confirm what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And this is what you want to approach.
This can be referred to as populism, but all the proposals I have spoken have already been working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament you will only remain tags.
And that is why you are not far far far away in politics.
Or do you think that if you just talk to people for long enough, you will succeed in carrying out the material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other possibility.
Politicians, journalists and the public to convince and try to put them on our side to implement these goals.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to encourage the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legally attack the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and lawyers.
And the speakers would then have to say why they reject this.
A strong personality pointing out to disadvantage can pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct choice of the President who was a public pressure service.
I'm sure I'm an assassin; I'm not a genius nor an intelligencer.
I'm trying to find associations for my views and visions.
With the politics I have just started and have tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to assess the things themselves; and if it does not work, I will go back to the private sector in six years.
This sounds a little than whether Okamura should save Czechia.
I'm not a Retter.
I know that I'm not enough alone, so I talked to several well-known personalities about whether they don't even want to channel for the senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who refused for work overloading.
I also supported the research journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered fraud in trade with light heat oil.
I started my candidate with the prerequisite that people are deeply unequivocal, but now I'm no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the voters have not gone to the elections, and those who have gone have usually chosen representatives of the establishment.
We are only two independents in the senate.
People have chosen such a senat composition that changes will be very difficult.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct choice of the mayor and heads of district.
Do you think about the creation of a own party?
I have not yet thought about this because I have no time to check the past of any potential party members, and I do not have the money for it.
I haven't even money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account only 20.000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You talk about wealth statements, how do you look like?
My private capacity is estimated at about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, a apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth some one million, and then I have a few million on the account.
The Aston Martin, on the other hand, was a child room - James Bond always enjoyed me as he went in the car, was galant to women and at the same time strugg against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and don't have any money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but your own money does not want you to invest in it.
That's not just convincing.
I have no 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make guilt?
I already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my programme does not give too much interest.
And I am not obliged to fight the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaigns are basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live from the senator content alone; for example, I couldn't finance my son the English school that costs 30.000 a month.
If I just wanted to earn money, I wouldn't be able to do anything.
So continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your results?
Didn't you say you're going to go back these activities?
But that does not relate to the height of the salary.
As promised, I went back to my activities in part.
For example, my Deputy Representative in the spring of the Travel Office will become the director.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live from something too.
To what monthly income were you used as entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still so.
As President, however, I would set my businesses entirely.
You will find the full conversation in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head only - the example of spijkecies and the recently built bookberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passant on the street edge.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large business, says, "But, it's beautiful, the house."
But I wonder what we need a booklet today.
All have internet, iPad and e-books.
No humans are still going to one of these Old Style libraries today, right?
Spikes, a hardly visiting city of sleep in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is an incredible record holder.
The 80.000 residents' entrepreneurship shows the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid state, it has been decided for a few years to contribute to general education and to the seven fictional bridges represented on the euros as beautifully poned steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the education office was limited.
And so the city fathers recognized that it would be only one way to become the statistics of the Lord: A library must come here!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam Architecture Office MVRDV, master of the magnificent bar charts and producers of funny, even often zinish buildings, took the matter with habitual freedom and appeared to the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grain in the face.
And while the jury was still exposed to look at himself and tock with the Achsels, the freying Maas accumulated his ready lead of size to a pyramid and finished his activisticly undermaturated speech with the words: "Liebe Town Congregation!"
So that is he, my proposal for the bookberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Bookenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros have been shot.
It is part of a revitalisation project, which includes deep garage, supermarket, post and a few adjacent housing and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the bookberg was awarded the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012 has also been nominated.
In this way, the unvisitable small town retors, which have not been offered any more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a conservatively harmless coat house, behind which white facades would be inclined to presume a molkery factory in order to make a piece of contemporary architecture more rich.
Especially, however, spices now have the first public culture building in the history of his existence.
The long way to book
The first impression: bookel dorado under kaaseglocke.
There is a lift that leads through the mountain mass, but the true space and lectures are deciding in the smooth climbing of the topography.
The roundly sealed interior is bright and overlooked, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street lasers speak indispensable the language of a public town site.
The city's ambience is perfect.
You're already watching Parkbank, dog and soccer playing guys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the books are along the fassade, and in the middle there is a large, dark space, which is mostly inappropriate and inpersonal," says Winy Maas.
We headed the classical room configuration and stole the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the bookberg is used in the middle of offices, Internet library, Chess Club, Environmental Centre and Home Technology Centre.
A special joy are the black book areas, which are times wall clothing, sometimes brassing, times tricking countries.
Optics, haptics and smell are strange.
Even measuring architects and construction engineers shaken the head of the unknown material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the city community of Speijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so we are struggling into an appropriate waste product from agriculture in a foreign farm one day.
For many years, in the Netherlands, a millimeter-dunn plastic vlies is used in cotton houses and in fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds one, two seasons, then it's mature for the lock.
For the library, the Vlies - first in these quantities - was pressed to four centimeter thick plates.
Under heat impact and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is painted to a dark, homogeneous, burdenable material that leads to new cars and a bit to sports shoes.
After 105 stages you have reached at the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters of hiking, you will be rewarded in the literature café not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch crocots and topped ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, especially for the right humidity in the literature mountain.
donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is a prestigious project in puncto ecological despite the many glass surfaces," Trouborst says.
Heated and cooled with earth warms.
Although the bookberg is under a glass tower, the sun itself seems to be in the inside of sunny days.
The broad wood-leimbinder, which stands across the glass facade, serves as well as catching a large part of the sun radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest performs fully automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial creator from the IT industry, was already waiting the way to the new booksei.
Lisette Verhaig was here too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogard, who even describes the Buchenberg as a spice "long excessive soul".
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to spend a book from his personal file.
This means that the optical gaps are filled in the currently 700,000 pieces of libraries that are not yet complete.
The concept has come up.
The regimes are filled up to top.
" Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just a bolt.
MVRDV succeeded in the king's discipline, which is called identity in the journal.
Spikes wrote literature history.
So young and uneducated she may be.
This is finally a point of approach for identity.
Szabo: "Germany must play greater role"
Germany has included the vote on the adoption of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert for US-European relations, Berlin thus balanced in a narrow diplomatic degree.
German Welle: at the beginning of the week Germany had first signaled that it would vote against the request for a observer status of the Palestinians to the United Nations.
But then it was Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what Israeli did in Gaza.
However, due to its special relationship with Israel, Germany must be careful now.
But at the same time I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - however, without being too critical to Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also contained its voice as a flight ban area.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international topics?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just about its foreign policy, and it is away from a policy managing by the United States to a German foreign policy.
It is difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are thus opposed to the fronts.
They are expected to play an independentr role, but they are not pleased.
I think they are still tasted at their role, but they are on the way to a more normal foreign policy.
A foreign policy as they have France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean concretely from German viewpoint?
It shows the willingness to involve positions in national interests which are independent of those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, so by exports and its relationships with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are at a certain degree different from the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests have influenced the position of the Nahost conflict and the UN vote?
For one thing, Germany has large paragraph markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to face the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
This is at least a role.
But I wouldn't want to take this too much weight, that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But in any case it plays an important role in German thoughts.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by comprising important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That's why I don't think this was as a dramatic break, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even play a certain respect.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as an international player and must be considered his interests.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, expressed itself clearly for a veto.
Are there differences in opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of the American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama is in secret has quite a lot of understanding for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position.
I believe that the actual differences in opinion are not at all as large as they always appear.
If you look at the relationships between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so brightly excited by Netanjahu's policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree with Israel and the USA on one hand, and the EU’s main partners' position on the other?
I think that makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans, if it would be a coherent and uniform European policy, which is currently not the case.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and must prevail things from their own position instead.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe in the future that Germany will take a leading role in encouraging Europe to a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany to do so because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they have to play an independentr role.
Is Germany itself in the role of an important international player - does Germany ever want to take a major role?
Or does Germany still find the role of leadership difficult?
Germany is still not pleased, that is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the Eurocrise, there will be different anti-German feelings every time Germany takes a greater role.
That doesn't make the Germans easy.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
This is how Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable for various neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in European policy continues to diminish, but the EU does not fill at the moment of this vacuum, who else remains?
The Germans will have to play a larger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and they're still much unbelievable - c'est la vie!

"Market protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
In that case, a official name in China is endangered, but nothing to do with the originating company.
Nevertheless, it enjoys as long protection as the actual name makers do not complain.
And even then, it is not clear whether they get right.
"It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer in the Kanzlei Taylor Wessing, specialized on protective right injuries in Fernost.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The imitators already range a few additional letters so that they may log in their brands.
Thus, from Gucci just Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada lets you enter Prada-Kny.
German companies are also copyed legally in this way, such as the sports product manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries of the trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14th, 2010, a Chinese company gave protection to the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name of art that also served at Ermenegildo Zegna's fashion house.
The Chinese World Championists are known in copying and injured spiritual property.
In the large cities, there are multiple purchase houses that sell almost exclusively gradients.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: On behalf of its clients, he proposes that Chinese companies are officially given the right to use a label that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chineses call the "Bang Mingpai", a trademark.
The word is directed to Bang Dakuan.
This means women who call for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of guilt
"This is business harmful, you have to fight it," says Pattloch.
"The brand is watered, the single setting disappears, the damage of the image is enormous."
The financial losses and process costs of the sectors concerned go into the millions, especially in expensive products.
According to the Market Research Society CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury products with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year.
However, removal of dubioser entries in the brand register is difficult to reach and go to the money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can be taken, with unchanged outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court rejected complaints because after the long duration of the contested name was "marketic".
If the complainant has pech, he must even pay money to the plagiator because he injured his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes here is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer Sany, that company, who recently took over the German concrete pump engineer Putzmeister.
The Chineses are therefore allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star until today.
The Volvo buyer Spiritly originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was lightened, Gibly had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against afterahmer from Hong Kong and Singapore, who left the famous crocodil to the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there have been a number of shorter staff and room facilities there in 2010.
The last year, however, has been returned from the "Not situation in the working run to normality".
Thus, the file of unprocessed imprisonment was reduced by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than the previous year.
Nevertheless, the office still waits for 81,500 requests for completion.
On the other hand, it costs a lot
As often as in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO entered more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost one third more than 2010.
This is a record and suggests that China takes the list of new applications all over the world for the tenth time, the Authority shall notify.
This also amounted to the file of all valid brand marks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1,8 billion Yuan were charged.
Simplified means that each application costs 1280 Yuan or 160 Euros.
On the other hand, a frequent cost, as the case of the German family company delightenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group fights against a Chinese plagiator.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal factory was eliminated by imitated motor vehicle parts.
But the imitator continued to ensure the Chinese rights at the Freudenberg brand.
You have failed, since family names could not be protected in Germany, Hanno Wentzler says, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademarkamt CTMO pointed back the objection of the Munichr as well.
In the next two instances, joynberg got right, but the opponent fights up to this day.
You need to keep your eyes out of here.
Now the case is addressed to the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionality of the courts.
But he also says: "The procedure is extremely excessive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were hardly important, the company archive had even had to search through one hundred years old documents to provide evidence.
Five years ago, joynberg of the opposite offered an "home six-digit euro" amount for payment.
"Daran you see how much it is worth us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in Fernost are even threatening back to Europe.
Then, if imitators are secured there unprotected brands.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has long been suspended by the Group, yet he could turn the registration away.
"You need to look höllically," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommend German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, instead, the foreigners should "log in all that is somehow protective, also in China", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can become much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if joynberg is undergoing in the last act of its brand drama, then you should probably pay the opposite license fees for your own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we're motivated from the market in the questionnaire segment.
Worldaidsday: Stampping, singing, help
In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi - and Swaziland - is looking forward to vigswaises.
The history of a connection that surpasses far more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, the steam is: Cowboystiefel, Basketball shoes, Dame pumps and men's lipper are looking for the tact on the parket floor.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swell on - old, bass, tenor and soprano - distress, and follow themselves.
And Fite Hope, the 29-year-old Dirigent, has it almost out of his shoes when he brings them together with his swift wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the musical room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi is trying a new song.
To the fifty singers and singers, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human genetics to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every chor voice has another text and this is still in a very strange language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Worldwide, some 34 million HIV infected, estimated Unaids, the United Nations programme for the fight against AIDS.
23,5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland 245 Aidswaisen live.
In the meantime, more than 40 percent of the population are HIV-positive.
For 180 Aidswaisen in the village of Esitjeni, the association has found voices for Africa Paten in Germany.
70 of them visit a further school.
You can take a pace for 15 or 20 euros a month.
She guarantees the child school money, school union and a warm meal daily in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means on Zulu story counters or also lob prizes.
The Bantu language fluently speaks in this room no one can, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir songs have been exercising in this strange soft language and returning it back to where they originate: in southern Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometers of airline from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voting force of the German chore.
40 percent are infected
Approximately 2000 people live there, some are still in simple lehm and shrubs, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore because they are laid down to the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, it shows itself in the smallest, what is total of Swaziland: highest HIV infection rate, low life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Infringements of male preface, which prove to reduce the risk of infectation by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland wear the immune weak virus in themselves to die with thirty, is no rareness.
In a common African journey in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but especially the Imbongis saw many children on the streets that lacked not only by parental care, but light to everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private engagement of individuals to send a child for a few euros a year to school and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association, who then almost cares about the aids-Waisen in Esitjeni.
Facts for sexually transmitable infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI includes Syphilis, Chlamydien and Tripper (Gonorrhö).
Common viral STI are HIV, human patiloma viruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filtal juice and barbecue belong to the parasitar STI.
Who are the main stakeholders?
Syphilis and trippers are especially present in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute assumes that at least four of five of all hisphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
Chlamydien infections, trichomonads, candidosis (Pilz), tripper and human patilomavir are commonly present sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is low among iterosexual adults in this area - yet, about 20 percent of HIV new infections fall from this group.
In young people, chlamydien infections are much more frequent than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, there are common human patiloma viruses in young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections in 2001 has doubled to 3698 diseases in 2011 more than double.
The number of HIV new infections has been reduced since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than a year before.
What symptoms are pointing out to a gender disease?
Infection diseases may cause swine in the genital area, complaints in the urine, flow, under-construction pain, and blasts or wars.
Often, however, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms and are therefore unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condome can reduce the risk of contamination, but does not provide a hundred percent protection.
Because part of this can also be transmitted by spare infections and close body contacts from sexually transmitted diseases.
Therefore, experts especially recommend regular studies in frequently alternating sex partners.
Early diagnosis can be healed most STI and avoided late follow-up.
Thanks to patches, donations, and not least the gaps that the choir is going to be throughout Germany, some come together.
"In total, we have sent about 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a most conscious and passionate woman, the money from Germany.
She also cares about being well encountered with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as you call the old women on Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 weess, give them a roof over their head and ensure that the children appear on their uniforms every day for school education.
Anyone who has no more comes to the protective house to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid as by the association as the two cows who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has set a close school into life, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many have made HIV tests in the village.
This is not a sensitivity, because it is obvious that the disease in the whole country is, it is the most delicate one.
A king with 14 wives
"Aids is a absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country in which the king officially holds 14 wifes.
The last absolute Monarch Black Africa, King Mswati III., is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamie instead of democracy.
Among other things, this stately sanctified life form is blamed that the HI virus has spread so quickly over the past decades.
But also the many hiking workers wear the virus through the country.
Free condomes are at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote the cultural exchange, the Imbongi core travels all two, three years together through the southern Africa and sings songs full of mercy, fighting spirit, conviction and black self-consciousness, which many know from the time of the apartness on the southern Zipfel of the black continent.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language - so much recognition does not only result in mood and joy, but has already a few ugly bordersol data a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their pace children.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, it is more known in the valley of Ezulweni.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light," people say there.
And when you return to Heidelberg the 8733 miles [8733 km] airline, to the straining singers in the sample room at the mountain home street, you can also see it there.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on the Merkur
The Sonde Messenger has found evidence of there on the planet of Merkur Ice.
The ice blanket may be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet of Merkur.
Although it is next to the sun, there is also frozen water as from three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Sonde Messengers have found evidence that there is an ice roof in the permanently in the shadow of the planet.
It is supposed to be at least 30 centimeters and perhaps even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly also asteroids affected in the Merkur.
But no one brings the founding of ice related to the existence of life on the planet, said the head scientist of the Messenger-Sunde, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Merkur can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have come into other areas of the solar system.
Unmarked by earthquakes, sins, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are looking for the depths of the world all.
From time to time they send images to earth: Small gambling holes in infinite wides.
The picture comes from a camera who developed German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, also the twin planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who is behind Neptun around the sun, Ceres is not a "planet" after the new definition of the International Astronomy Union in 2006.
This picture section of an infrared recording of the top telescope shows a "family sport" counted star generations: The oldest stars are to recognize as blue points, more difficult to identify are the pink colours "newborn" in the star circular hall.
This star-based region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescoat top in the star image of Cassiopeia, in a distance of 6500 light years.
This shy glude of a dying star has taken up the top telescope of the Nasa.
The Donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star slew out in the death process.
In the huge Trifid Nebel, 5400 light years away from the earth, gas and dust create new stars.
The top telescope of the Nasa shot this photo of the Galactic Birthstube.
The palejad star pillow, also called "The seven sisters", can be seen with the mere eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better used.
As a red age, the Helix Nebel looks forward to the viewer on this Infrared Photo.
It is located 700 light years away in the aquarium star image.
His similarity with an earthly continent introduced this nebula to the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides for the spectacular coloration.
This baby star could only be included in his full beauty by the infrared detectors of the top telescope.
Saturn and its rings: As they have been created, one of the great puzzles of the astronomy.

One of the largest and hardest records of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the colors, recordings of spiraal galaxies will be made to true art works.
The record published by the European South-Sternewarte shows the Trifid-Nebel, which is several thousand light years away in the star image Schütze.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (dreigspread, threatened columns), since dark dust stripes tribe the glowing heart of the stars' birthplace.
In the constellation of serpents, astronomers have photographed the prebots of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light years away from the earth rose the cores of two melting galaxies together and are unequivocally collecting together.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
As regards technical abbreviations, it may be called at her nickname southern wheel.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows a cut from the Irisnebel in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light years away nebel consists of dust corns, which are ten to hundred times smaller than normal home dust.
This image was compiled from optical and Röntgen recordings of different telescopes.
It shows a ring from black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, took up the Hubble space telescope for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy calls scientists UGC 1810.
The brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way is located in this constellation.
The stars are always produced new young stars.
These star clouds, associated with the rosette nebel, also produce running new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this bright radiating galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust but only gas.
Researchers suggested that it was created shortly after the Urknall, when it was mostly found hydrogen in the universe.
Our views into All: The most important telescopes
The telescope was expected to be found in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilee took it a year later to monitor stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescope have become ever larger - and the insights they deliver.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telesco was the largest remote tube in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Great Binocular Telescope stands.
It allows views to all over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror is only 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Yet he reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of the cheap construction methods: The telescope is torn into its height angle - thus restricted in its movability.
The hobby eberly telesco in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
His speciality: the high body of light.
This is because, despite comparatively small mirror diameter, this is enough to the world's largest mirror telescope.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to all according to external signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) every computer owner can help by providing accounting services.
Look at the Observatory of the European Starwarts (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here the Very Large Telescope - which makes his name all the honour.
With a total of four mirrors, the remote tube can also light the average infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned on the Chileenic ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is to include sat 42 meters - and composed with some 1000 mirrors.
At the very early date of 2018, however, it is expected to be counted with images.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes were the largest of the world in the harwaiian volcano Mauna Kea.
They offer two mirrors with each average of ten meters.
The keck telescoop is part of the Mauna-Kea-Observatorium, which, next to them, looks into heaven with the Subaru-Telescope and IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, huge telescope - with a mirror average of 30 meters.
Here it is to be surprising on an illustration.
The most important impressions from the All, however, deliver the Sky Telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, images of distant worlds are already provided.
Since March 2009, the World Space Telescope Kepler has been searching for extrasolutional planets - mostly for those living.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates were determined since the beginning of mission.
In the picture the last initial preparations are documented at the World Space Telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is shot at the beginning of 2018 on board an Ariane5-Rakete.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope tasks: It should look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Urknall.
Scientists assume that there is also at the South Pole of the Merkur Eis.
However, there are no reliable data for this, since the messengers are much closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have been demonstrated since decades that there is an ice on the Merkur.
By the 2004 Messenger-Sunde - the first that creates around the Merkur - the scientists now have certainty.
Daily butter drinks - and 168 years old
In the southern Azerbaijan, many people reach Biblically high age.
There is even a museum for long-term life.
A track search in the country in which 97 years are still relatively young.
In the southern Azerbaijan, many people reach Biblically high age.
There is even a museum for long-term life.
A track search in the country in which 97 years are still relatively young.
The drive through the Talysch-Gebirge is to be called wildromantic.
The small bus rising over the spacious street, passing on closely forested hills, rising rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is just a few kilometers away.
Here, the Caucasian people's group of Talycs, from which it is not much known, besides that it speaks perfectly Persian, as well as Asheric, and is very long-lasting.
End station is Lerik.
The small town is protected with too roughly advised architecture from Soviet times, which does not even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the arrival of Azerbaijan's capital of Baku.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours, because the street is only one clean.
The glorious wealth of the country due to its oil in the Kaspian Sea has not yet arrived in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the view of tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous with the Eurovision Song Festival in May - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum for long-term life, well the only one in the world.
Here is the vitamin documented from about eight dozen talytics from the area which is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he became 120 years old.
Aged 136 years old witnessed to a child
But surrounded star of the museum has become the sheephirt >>eng<<iorali Müsümov, who should have become 168 years old.
However, a birth certificate does not exist.
And in view of the oldest documented person, who became 122 years old, Müsülmov’s age appears extremely doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he was supposed to have witnessed a daughter.
So, was he counting a few decades in his age?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, aged researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has been one of the high days in Central Asia.
"There are many highly old people in some areas of China, Japan or Hunza Valley in Pakistan", says Scholz, "also in Sardinia lives extremely many very old men."
However, because of missing documents, there should be no scientific evidence about age, especially in the absence of personnel registers.
Facing melted butter every day
However, it is fact that people of the region around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
At present there are 20 people older than 100 years.
Why so live here in the south so many high-bittents?
The Asian Guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talycs.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is in the diet.
But that the calories of the talytics should be healthy, love meat, bread, and especially milk products, and many of them drink a glass of melted butter daily does not appear from nutritional views justly plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that people keep young? In Cemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With her 97 years, she is still young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the entire aucasus region.
She sits on the ground with a butterfacing that she rolls inevitably down and down.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are longest grandparents.
Two grandchildren also jump around.
In the kitchen you will prepare the guests who are served in the typical, bulk-shaped armadu glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth stands perfectly in series and songs, under her head towel she hides long, dark blossom pots that proudly reveals her son before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"Shampoo did I never use," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly Rental enough for life
She has always eaten what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, heirs.
My whole life I didn't buy food once in the supermarket.
Then she told her husband who was in the army.
The worst thing was after World War II.
But everything was better than the "loved Father" Heydar Aliyew took over the rower.
The propaganda sounds strangely out of the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is driven around the patriarch of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, hardly knows limits in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the rower.
After all, there is no need under Azerbaijan's old age.
230 Manat (without the same sum in Euro) receives Mirzayeva monthly as a pension, for the present conditions a amount of which you can live well.
And maybe Mirzayevas also has a long time of exciting son rightly: "The old people enjoy highachting in our culture."
They live in the midst of the grand family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If this is not a reason to stay as long as possible
The word "human law" is missing in the constitution
The revolution has returned to Kairo.
Rivalizing Candidates in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Scharia as a base is heavily controversial.
The Egyptian President did not speak with Pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in the state-of-state view.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but especially to the Christian Copies, the Liberals, cleared Muslims and Seculars.
For they all, hopelessly broken in a confusion opposition, have fear.
Fear of a God’s state on the Nile of Grace of the mighty Muslim brotherhood.
He, then, said Mohammed Mursi almost excused, temporarily cut the competences of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competences to save the revolution.
But what the 61-year-old engineer who wears a doctoral title of the American University of South California really wants to save, the Egyptians are, the world is not clear.
Should the judicative be disposed?
In fact, the 234 articles, which were preserved by the Islamic dominated 100-köpfige Constitutional Assembly, are partly exciting concern in a nightly 15-hour perfume trip.
As in former Constitutions, it also states in the draft, the legal statement is based on the "Prinzipia of Islamic Law".
But what is "principe"?
This was and is the case of interpretation and it is scared that Islamists will use the swimmy formulation and the corresponding legal space for a more stringent interpretation of the scharia.
This suggests at least a newly added article: in all the matters concerned, the Al-Ashar University must be approached, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great radical power in the entire sunny Islam.
This does not have to, but it can mean that the clergy oversight the legislation, which the facto has resulted in the discouragement of the judiciary.
Much in the draft draft is interpretation case
It is also problematic: civil military judiciary should continue to be maintained.
During Mubaraks, these courts served rule to oppositional impression.
After the dictator's fall, up to 1,000 civilians sat in military arrest.
The state should also, in the draft, protect "the true beings of the Egyptian family" and promote their moral values and their values".
This is legally so implicit that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In the clear text, this means nothing else than censorship.
No article, on the other hand, expressly describes the equality of men and women.
For that, another forbids to offende or slander the prophets of Mohammed and his Messengers.
What, however, is a breach and how to be committed remains unclear.
Dubios likewise encourages the formulation that "bearment of people" is prohibited.
Is there already a cardicature of the President or a joke at the expense of a legal teacher?
The case of interpretation, as much as it is in the draft that Mursi is subject to the signature and, after his words "behind" the Egyptians will be presented to the people's vote.
"The Revolution has returned"
The opposition has been formed against the overwhelming power of the Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual inauguration on Friday evening on the Tahrir-Platz in Kairo and praised to fall the chart before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-party presidential elections.
Peace Nobel Prizes and Ex-Chef declared Mohamed El-Baradei, the Constitution Design was "on the Müllberg of History".
By means of short news service Twitter, he watched the followers Mursis to want a "putsch against democracy".
"If he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and storm him," said oppositional Jasser Said.
"We are not still tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet sophisticated," the Egyptian media quoted Chaled Ali opposition policy.
And several judges announced not to want to monitor the referendum, which would become invalid.
"The Coran is our Constitution"
The well organized muslim brotherhood blew its opposite demonstration, but not precautionaryly on the Tahrir-Platz, but after a mass prayer on the other nephew at the Kaïroer University.
Many distorted women and followers of the Salafists participated in and called: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They called of Mursi: "Sure the land!" and prayed, "The Koran is our Constitution."
A battle around the Highy over the symbols of Tahrir-Platz, on which all took its beginning, would probably have suspended civil war-like conditions.
This was evidently not to risk Mursis followers.
The Muslim brothers stated that both the opponents of the constitutional draft and the advocates had been loud and clearly expressed.
Now it is time to let the people decide on the electorate in what direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft Islamists are considered safe.
"The word of human rights is not even happening"
Haphez Abu Soda is angry with this advanced constitutional process, which actually had gone until February and should embrace all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organisation of Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they sat under Mubarak in prison or were courted.
Not because he would share its world view, but because human rights are impartial for him.
He was crushed, sentenced, arrested.
"And now, the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "world on Sunday".
Mursi made power extending to all three authorities in the state the lawyer resigned.
These measures are explicit infringements of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President put it the facto out of force," so said.
But without civil society organizations, a democracy cannot work.
Soda is left alone, also by the international community, who considers the ideological direction campaign at the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could wreak.
A demonist warned on the Tahrir: "You bear a monster that you can't control anymore."
Rakfish from Norway: Is this the most exciting fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life - not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the success secret of the country have something to do with the local appetite on quite profound fish?
You take a selection of overridden cheese varieties.
They are placed in the midst of a hip of dirty, moisture sports dress.
And call her there a week.
About this, you have to imagine the wet-inducing smell of Rakfish, one of the great delicate messengers of Norway.
I find myself in the small town of Fenten, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes here - and this hardnecky smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfish is provided with salt-protected forests, which - depending on how stinking you would like to have his fish - is fermented up to a year in water.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather is colder, Norweger flows to a festival here in Fench, which is dedicated to this, now, very bestying specialty.
"There are rough and then damping it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havand Halvarsen, who actually works in the local wake, but the festival also organises as a so-called "Rakfish-General".
Around us, people disperse small fishermen and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfish," says Haward.
Spirituose can endured the smell.
I'm gonna cost some hips.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfish in Nasennahe, it is not bad - like Sushi, who has a very long bus ride.
Rakfish is the product of a very different, far from poorer Norwegian epoch when there were no cooling opportunities and fish was in autumn in a air-dichte salt water vessels.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken out after long fermentation and, without doubt, defeated senses with the help of alcohol.
Even before a generation, thousands of Norweger looked to work forced to leave their country and mainly changed into the United States.
Today, the population grows rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who had not yet been far more rich than Norway, flowing immigrants.
Rakfish is considered something important - as an essential, though strictly rieching part of the Norwegian history.
He belongs to the more expensive courts you can buy here.
But actually here is everything expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 Euros.
Norway doesn't often create it into the world press, and most people do not seem to be disturbed.
Here you still hate to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist legal extremists, the last year 77 men, women and children shot.
However, only the "People of July 22" refers to the event.
Norwegers are hard to accept that in their peaceful country someone is able to kill such brutal.
The main responsibility for today’s wealth of Norway has been the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why it's so good for us," Anna, our cellar, distributes round tabletts with mature racfish and embodies the northern ideal with its long blond hair and stinging blue eyes.
We're a - as you say - careful people.
Her English is just like most people here makelless.
We're not very responsive, we don't like prahlry.
Norway has been very careful about its oil empire - a large part of the sectoral yields will be invested in a special fund for the good of future generations.
When, in the years until the world economic crisis, all of them were warned about money that they did not have, Norway held his cash stocks firmly closed.
"As long as we can drive ski and walk in summer, we're happy," Anna says.
"And of course, Rakfish eats," she adds with unnoticed laughter.
I'm standing in the snow, and I'm going to have another court from Rakfish.
So a ice burber is in any case another thing.
But in the evening, the Stinkefish is on the food plan.
The hotel where I log in is one of several events that organize a racfish dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the smell of fish most challengingly.
There is a live TV cup to a showmaster dressed with a fly, surrounded by tellers with Rakfish.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Haward."
You smell and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by Aquavit.
But maybe it is the strict thirst of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto stands for difficult start
While Mexico’s future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares his office approach, Will Grant analyses the challenges to him and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico city is very bad.
Even at better days, this is a always hidden city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which locks several important transport routes into the capital and provides chaos on the streets.
However, the aim was not to disturb pendlers on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the President-in-Office and take the leadership of the nation.
He is faced with a complex task.
Under the divorcing government Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been able to provide good economically, but the country is in the hand of a drug war that has cost 600,000 human lives over the last six years.
"My government is strongly engaged in reducing violence," said Pena Nicho at the Oval Office at the US-American President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy to achieve this objective.
Pena Nieto was a governor of his home State in Mexico before he went on to the U.S. President.
In this dense population, far-reaching part of the country surrounding the capital, the opinions are divided about the new Head of State.
A direct man
For example, in the distant small town Valle del Bravo you like to remember him.
Inhabitors of the vacation site attribute to the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the cars that made Pena Nicho build and represent a great improvement to the breach, hollow roads that were here once.
Pastets with its name also depend outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum to climate change.
"We expect from him real and lasting changes," said his friend and political merit Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a conventionist for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, what the security and the economy involves, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was dissolved by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Olvera Congress devoted that after 12 years, the party is making great expectations to Enrique Pena Nieto outside the Los Pinos presidential palace.
The objects of opposition, the new President lacked substance, he refuses.
He was a very direct man, very engaged and has great plans for the country.
He was an excellent stateman, but he was also someone who can listen to.
But on the other side of the State, many people do not share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to Valle del Bravo's planted streets could not be greater.
The place is hidden under car tram transfers and is in many respects a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was activated to fight the drug bands operated in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot of Brachland near a large waste depony, only over the last two years, the bodies have been abandoned dehumidly murdered women.
During the term of office of governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the State of Mexico - a statistics that even overwhelms the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is infected for their violence and murder of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos believe that he is at least inappropriate about the problem of women's murder during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes before the problem.
In a concrete construction, typically for the falling quarter, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana started suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her companions.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed like her body washed," says Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body streak had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is fitted next to a cross that wears a single word: justice.
But just this, so the family, you've been refusing her up until now.
The authorities treated me as if I were a cockier, an unresty studio, Nörglerin.
They want to be just accepted and kept your mouth.
"But this is not possible if there are so many shape mistakes and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the President's binding on Saturday, he also takes a great responsibility.
During the last six years, tens of thousands of Mexican families have been brought into communicate by violence, and the new President has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope he is as President as he was as governor," says the PRI congressary Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are the most afraid of that.
State prosecution claims: Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The State Prosecutorship contradicts Bradley Manning's refusal that he had been abused in prison
The hearing is discussed with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
Defense aims to reject the claims due to hard liability conditions
The liberant of the U.S. army is forbidden to have lost thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the prosecutor tried to determine that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused for the greatest enthusiasm of confidential information from the US-American history - has failed several occasions to suspend abuse in military war.
At a cross-subscribe maning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained Maj. Ashden Fin that documents to weekly visits, the prison officials during Manning's nine-month liability in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-border, which was held due to an application of defense to reject the claim - Manning had already been punished sufficiently through the hard liability period - Manning said that he had considered suicide in prison.
The Secret Service Analysis of the US Army, arrested in June 2010, will be expelled to have stole thousands of confidential documents during his service time in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the Friday hearing, Fein continued with Manning the forms that officials had filled with Manning during his captivity in the quantico military prison, where he had set up under increased liability conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked mening questions and wrote his answers.
When fine asked him to the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had assessed the treatment through his guards as "excellent" and the treatment through the establishment as "sehr professional".
The forms, according to fine, did not have any complaints about abuse, although the officials had questioned maning directly for his treatment.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed his concerns and that the officials had spoken with him and stated that they were not logged.
"They wrote (for the concerns) "No problems", and that did not necessarily mean that I said nothing at all," says Manning.
The judge, Oberst Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met in January 2011 with a committee that should examine the suicide thoughts mentioned by him several months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to reduce his observatory status to the prevention of injuries.
The military said that it has assigned him this restrictive status - one stage under suicide hazard - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that it was good for me, and the status of observing the prevention of injuries (...) to be able to achieve a higher quality of life from my view," said Manning.
Manning said on Thursday to his arrest and retirement to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before he was imprisoned in the quantico prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said in Kuwait he had considered the suicide and had become unconscious because of the heat.
Not to know what was happening with him or in the outer world, have been burdening.
"My world shrinked in camp Arafjon, together on this cage," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent the majority of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
You only allowed him a mattress, a ceiling, flip-flops, clothing and his breeze.
Manning said he tried to stay in movement because it was the day that it had been prohibited to sleep or to go down.
Only he had to sleep with light, which came from outside into his cell.
When he turned around at night and couldn't see his face anymore, he was raised up so that he turned back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning was moved to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge Manning also asked for an accusation he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had to slapen a night in his cell in Quantico and had to stand at a morning counting against guards and other prisoners.
Manning had said he had never had the opportunity to cheat with his ceiling during this count.
At the Friday survey, Manning announced that he had closed from a command from his guard that he should have fallen the ceiling with which he could have covered, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had declared that he was forced to slapen in the previous night. He had previously tried to show a official that he would not represent a danger for himself.
Manning said to the official that he could have used the covenant of his underhose or his flip floats to hurt himself but not do so.
In this night, Manning said that his underhose, Flip flops and brilles were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge should be taken into account at least his aftermath experiences and that his liability would be drastically reduced, he should be condemned at his negotiation before the military court, which is established for the beginning of the next year.
The defense has stated that mening will claim to lower crimes, while other accusations that are considered too extreme.
The continuation of the hearing is for this weekend, and the advocate is expected to justify the liability conditions.
The pentagon remains in its position that maning was held in accordance with the provisions that apply to all prisoners stored under the highest security provisions in Quantico.
The complaint points against Manning include the beneficiary of the enemy, unlawful publication of secret service information on the Internet, the transfer of national defense information and the thief steel of public property or documents.
If he is found in all the complaints for guilty, he threatens a lifelong liability.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the immigrants - they call them hard times into memory, he says
Navarrete believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and arrived at the passing control when there was no counsellessness in me.
Painting refers to two queues: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Extranjeros").
I was standing there for a few seconds, uncertain to which I should give.
I grew up in Central California and was called my whole lifelong "Mexican".
A ethnic shortcut - just as my friends in Boston call "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later I decided for "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather there was no need for shortcuts or bindings.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim me in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't add about the vocabulary of a mother-speaker, and my American accent will not be left either.
So I took my American passport and put me into the snake for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda, all those topics which are expected when the heads of these two countries were meeting: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in speaking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason why Mexicans remain with the same probability in Mexico today instead of migrating into the United States.
He would like to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block according to the European Union's example.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cardals even if he did not give details about it.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of recessment.
Most Americans probably never conveyed a single idea that in 1848 the United States were in Mexico and forced the leadership of the country under premature gun to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. governmental officer exercises only mildest criticism to Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and under the elites of the country - complaints about how the Americans insist on the sovereignty of their neighbouring country.
And the children of Montezumas are on the war path.
And yet, the greatest challenge of Mexico is true in relation to more than 35 million American people living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about recessations?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for which the country offers opportunities, and others for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people live Mexican origins in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - had no chance to go to Mexico and to the north.
And in most cases, this person met a profile - dark, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the offspring of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may live the American dream, visit good schools and have received good jobs, we must never lose out of our mind that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be swimed, but what our loyalty involves is not the case.
This applies clearly to the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on mutuality.
They see us as a meal of a humbling defeat and look down at us because we are not mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough to never be strong enough to our bands to Mexico.
Your opinion is our existence a symbol of error.
If our families weren't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves caught behind the silk stock now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somewhat lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, who was legally emigrated as a child in the United States, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican American tensions exist, because Mexicans have a clearer idea who they are - and mexican Americans take this practice.
While she is US-American citizen, she looks as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling not to be one or another country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both the worlds, but no one is rooted in it.
In Mexico we are seen as an American.
And in the United States we are seen as a mexican.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some mexican leaders and parts of the educational citizenship want to resume their connections to Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as a provisorian "Botschafter" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and pressure on political leadership to intensify their bonds to Mexico.
Well.
That won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the disadvantaged income distribution, irrevocable corruption and drug violence, many of us are not at all so sure whether it really is a great country.
I'm afraid you're alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico for the other half centuries, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans have a wrath for how their family members have not been treated as long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more mexican than I thought.
Old fights, New Middle East
The armor silence between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected basic pillar for peace
Can there ever be continuing peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to sleeve such hope in the throat.
In the midst of the usual debts, countless buildings were laid in shock and ashes, over 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time rocks from Gaza are beaten near the Israeli metropole Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be caught in their historical conflict, the Middle East changes around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these whirls.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons for assuming that the deadly patch situation could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At the first glance, optimism seems to be suitable in view of the current situation.
Even if the arms' silence agreed on November 21, the fights of this week have strengthened the hard-hearted ones on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, are claiming that Israeli has retreated, although his group itself had to mention large losses.
Though several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza are imprisoned in one of the desolatest and closely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not managed to destroy Hamas until now.
In fact, the Hamas is gaining in the West-Jurdanland, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
So as Islamists in the Arab world have won influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a reinforced regional power once considered as Israel’s closest Muslim bonder, has taken for the Hamas Party - just like Qatar, one of the most rich and most dynamic Gulf States.
Jebelling Hamas followers believe that Israel is a Islamist semi-mond – from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hisbollah has power over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamistic presiding could stand before the storm of Bashar Assads, to Jordan, where Hamas associations threaten the king.
And in particular the rise in the Muslim brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most inhabited and most important Arab country - at the southern Fllanke of Israel, the balance of the region has changed sustainablely.
Hosni Mubarak, the Laizist despot, who ruled Egypt 30 years until his sturz 2011, had left only a few time for the Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood is weakened with the Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, the Hamas could prove to be a stakeholder who cannot be disrupted from Israel and the United States itself.
On the other hand, the Israeli hardliners have a contradictory conclusion.
Militaryly, the Hamas is no more danger.
The Israeli rocket defense system, "Iron Dome", has been able to provide and many of the Hamas rakets have been destroyed.
At least a while, Israel will be able to sleep quieter.
In diplomatic terms, the United States are indispensable to their position, and many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest violence scales.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process too large parts.
Although rockets have been killed from the Gaza strip since 2004 about 30 Israeli, the country has remained relatively free of suicides - not least thanks to the locking plants that went into the West of Gordanland, and thus in the main part of any Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared unlawfully, but are continually expanded.
Netanyahu stands well there. His Likud party has been bound in the front of the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Loverman with a more fighting group.
Why also contend these surrounded Palestinians and let them leave their own state?
If they were actually controlling the West-Jurdanland, would they not just like their contests in the Gaza Strip fire missiles?
No, it's better to keep them in chess behind the wall and punish them, they should wage to get the heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to persist, but the Arab Spring could make them a line through the bill.
Even if the Islamists who are now in Egypt and in other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The defense set of Israel is greater than its four Arab neighbours together.
A war with the local supermacht will hardly help the new Arab governments to maintain their economy.
That the magnificent President Mursi together with Barack Obama in order to achieve a army silence could be a promising sign - and may symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israeli too should think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking perceived steps towards democratisation, Palestinians will continue to deprive their right to self-determination - a powder phase that will undoubtedly explode one day into Israeli occupied areas, just as this week exploded a bus in Tel Aviv.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of Arab people this situation will only increase.
Blood missions to resist the Hamas in the Gaza strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribut over the years.
Both sides need an intrusion from outside
The right answer is those represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and of this newspaper: Two States in which Israel is departing for security purposes.
For the near future small hope, there is a greater influence in the arms suspension of foreigners to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, has to stop arms delivery in the Gaza strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the limits of 1967, supplemented by area exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations, the Hamas and Fatah should also move to a agreement.
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the proposed request for UN Observatorship.
Obama must also contribute to the movement of Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office, he abandoned the idea of his own peace plan.
As far away in the white house, it seems like he was also cut off a participation.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States have an essential interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for uniform cigarette packagings shall enter into force
Health warnings and damaged body parts on neutral green packs equal to all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging are in force in Australia. Thus, brand logos and colors are replaced by neutral, oil-green covers, which are also printed with drastic images, which show sick body parts and cigarette smoking infants and children.
From the different health warnings and images once, the only difference between the packagings in the brand names that are printed in identical, small fonts will come from Saturday.
Thus Australia introduces the most strict rules for tobacco packaging worldwide.
The Australian Federal Government wants to bring young people away from the smoke by eliminating the glamourous image of the tobacco consumption.
The government of studies that have shown that people with 26 have not yet started smoking will no longer start smoking with 99% of the probability.
"You can already see young children that they understand the message to try to apply the tobacco companies with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the least smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have little effect on the profits of multinational groups, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The Tabaklobby fighted hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would benefit the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and easier accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious unwanted consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian fans will offer widely larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have corrupted their business.
Sandra Ha by Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarette uis and silicone covers have risen enormously, since the British American Tobaccco, Britain's Imperial Tobaccco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobaccco have failed two months ago with their fight against the laws.
Zico sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale businesses and waited for new stocks.
For us this is a good business.
According to experts, the haken in popular social media is precisely the population group to which the plan is addressed.
A series of Australian laws has banished tobacco companies from TV reversal, forbidden them to enter into the Internet as a sportsponsor and most distributors forced not to post cigarettes in shops.
The Australian Government has prohibited Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but does not affect international pages.
"Where Tabak markets and only a small area left to apply its products comes not around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, researcher at the University of Sydney.
In social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman, Freeman found an increase in experience reports on brands written by "gant normal people".
You have to ask the question: Is this just a private person who finds so great pleasures in Marlboro cigarettes that she even takes a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do so?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry is focusing on marketing rather than on marketing to interfere with the new laws.
It has even gone so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to fight the new rules - those countries are inferior to the World Trade Organisation of Unjust trade restrictions, although none of the countries of greater trade with Australia is involved.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has conducted discussions with other countries which consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country in 2001, which prescribed photographic warnings.
In the meantime, these were expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are despite.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"You just take a kippe and put it away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette brick on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
There is only one reason why I would stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the Tabak trade "King of the Pack" in Sydney's city, says that the uniform packaging has scared the filling of his regimes.
"Before I needed an hour to place a delivery now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have just had to prohibit cigarettes - then we had said it was, we've done close," he adds to the above.
In a constantly electricated world, it is beautiful to be pleasing even once
This thanksgiving was expected to spend five hours in the airport, when our aircraft came through mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flyer.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts too bored.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for a flight half a day on the airport is quite nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones are available (and naturally tax-free shopping).
But more and more academics and child development experts are taking a long time as something positive.
If it is after them, it is for us - and our children - all right to be bored at times.
This forces the brain to lose in interesting thoughts, which might promote creativity.
And because most of us are now almost constantly staring on one or another screen, the benefits of the long-term are no longer helpful.
So should we welcome the long-term with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I'll come back to that again.
As many people, I have always assumed that long-terms are a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing recreation.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see that.
"In principle, the long-term has a very long history," he says.
Pompeji's house walls are a Latin graffiti over Langeweile, which goes back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define long-term.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, says that long-terms have been defined and discussed in many ways.
After long lecture of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that long-term experience as the experience to "determine a satisfactory activity, but not to be able to”.
In the long term, apathy differs from the fact that the person is not busy but wishes to be.
However, there is no urge for apathy to do something.
The key experience of the long-term, he says, best in a "storting the attention process, paired with bad laune and the feeling that time is only slowly passing away".
It can be almost as much as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two conditions could be related, the problem in her own environment or the world is that depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring even if we have only difficulty focusing on us.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German, about "The inactive Understanding: The definition of Langeweile under the aspect of attention," which appeared in the special journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point out an earlier experiment, listening to the participants of a band on which a person reads a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring area that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it to lower volume, so that it was hardly perceived, while the third group did not take these sounds at all.
The people who did the hardly hearing television suggested that they felt more long-term than the two other groups - they had problems to concentrate, could not find any reason for these and attributed their problems of long-term.
If you are trying to focus on a difficult or stressing task, the disturbance of attention can lead to longage, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neuro science at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you are engaged in a unique activity - "like searching for incorrect products on a factory fund band, music can reduce and help not feel inclined".
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappels and crystals, often interpreted as signs for long-terms, can fight them even by keeping people physically more careful.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to shoot around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to be pulsed to sit," says Professor Fenske.
We all become boring at some time - my late flight, a drunk loud speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people are bound to be easier than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed a "scala for long-term adverseness" in the 1980s.
On the scale, statements such as "Many things I have to do are repeated and are monotons" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys are often bored as girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially as regards the need for more and greater variety of external travel.
But in general, teenagers are a quite scattered hips.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and common development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and her parents seven to eight times a day with one pager.
He found that 32% of the adults had been bound by school and when the homeworks were completed, while 23% say they were bored if they weren't at school.
But only 3% of the parents said that they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know whether the percentages have risen or diminished in the long term.
However, he is sure that "the youth is particularly bored," mainly because children and teenagers do not have a great influence on their daily run.
So back to my question of origin: Is long-term healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it leads people to taking extreme physical risks and falling away from the gambling or drugs to help them - that has shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between long-term and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has examined the topic for more than two decades.
"During the long-term, the brain wants to say that you should do something different," says Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do best.
If you are bored and use this energy to play and cook guitar, you will be happy.
However, television can provide a short-term feeling of happiness, but they flee on a long-term basis.
So, if you are able to take an iPad enough, it can be deducted from the long-term, but it has not learned to enter or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self control is transmitted from one situation to the other."
The child learns not only to have a conversation but also receives more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we're supposed to get rid of a long time.
We should not also see them too critical.
Rather, our goal should be to benefit from the constant activity and technology availability.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds as if we should be more boring, but long-term is the shameful, persistent desire to do something senseful," he says.
He believes that people in truth are looking for a way, turn off and relax.
"In an area where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with when the noise is once stumbled."
In Colorado there is no clear guidelines for the new Marihuana Act
The 19-year-old Community College Student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the Southeast Colorados for a crime before court that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of some less marihuana bricks and a pee he smoked.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer Marihuana had found in the car, Orozco was charged for the possession of drugs and drug utensils - cavalier delicates, each with a sentence of 100 US dollars - and received a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," Orozco says.
But is he also one?
In the unsafe weeks following the decision of the State to legalise small quantities of Marihuana for own use, the answer is less dependent on the law at hundreds of smaller drug delicates than on the location.
Hundreds of infringements around Marihuana are already fallen in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities do not follow adults more than 21 years of possession in small terms, which is allowed legally as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next weeks.
But state lawyers in the more conservative districts of Colorados have announced to follow existing Marihuanadelics and still quote people before court.
At the same time, several cities vote, from the cities of Denvers to the Western Mountains, to prevent newly licensed Marihuana businesses at the opening in their communities.
"This situation continues so quickly that I don't even know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, head of police in Aurora, the east of Denver.
And also regulatory authorities in the state of Washington crushed at the head.
They are waiting for an orientation aid to establish a license system for production, production, sales and sales of drug – and have a period until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, Colorado believes that in any case most states are predicted as regards the regulation of Marihuana. There the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then for own consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. Therefore, the state is well suitable for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Supervisory Authority for Spirituosen in Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do any more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have any real precision for which we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus also forms the end point of a grey zone where the state license system is not yet available, but the property is legalized.
And unprecedented practice questions must be cleared at this time - such as the state default of a "angetastic access" to licensed Marihuana with the ban on cannabis business around 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
"Nirwhere it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the ballging area of Seattle", says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently trained research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his employees in Aurora, in which he explained that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller Marihuanadelics in people over 21 years, and that the police would "ab sofort" not seek criminal ads for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to carry out urban regulations to regulate farmers of marihuana and continue to pursue drug dealers.
In Weld County in the North Colorados district lawyer Ken Buck has a more stringent view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to follow cases of Marihuana ownership, mainly to move consumers to retreat.
Currently, 119 persons must be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less Marihuana before court, although many have also been accused for other delicates.
"Our authority has the duty to pursue infringements in which it was a matter of crime," said Buck.
The reactions are susceptible in locations such as rural Mesa County, where voters refused the Marihuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, no longer shows adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to leave all outgoing ownership procedures.
"I don't think I miss my time to pass through the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the choosers in Colorado supported the measure, it was already clear from the beginning that it would not be easy to agree to the personal consumption of Marihuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions in the whole state promoted a deepening difference in the great green experiment at day among local officials.
At District Prosecutors it is an "cultural career", says Sean McAllister, an lawyer from Denver, who acts as an advocate for Marihuanadelics before court and acts as a speaker for the national organization for the reform of Marihuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives in pursuing people criminally that they are still unable to accept the legalisation," he believes.
As the first countries dealing with smaller quantities of Marihuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national pattern cases for the legalisation of drugs.
While speakers and government officials prepare for a age of legal sales, they also wait nervously for instructions of the Federal Government, which continue to treat marihuana's sales and cultivation at a federal level.
Proclaimers of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will comply with.
Despite several exciting arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marihuanas, the Federal Government has allowed the sale of medical marihuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states to be large.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser of the Obama government, believes that although criminal officials are probably not going to enter doors to take smaller quantities of drugs, they are probably struggling under the new legislation, stately regulated Marihuana businesses.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipal administrations approved Moratories for new Marihuana businesses, although they could only open them in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided a six-month ban, probably adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position in which we are licensed and then standing at a major problem at the Bundesebene," said Bob Nicholson, member of the Council of City.
Our community has voted against this amendment of the law.
We are focusing on what the municipality has decided and not on what the State has decided.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mobbed from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students today will be attacked for their views
My greatest dream was always to get a place at the University of Oxford.
My father and my elder brother had attended that university, which I once thought for the world's largest knowledge stamp, for a modern Greek symposion that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks after my entry at the Worscester College at the end of the eighties - there I had been preferred to study history - I had packed my case again and so brought the first scandal of my life.
My father broke together in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard, it was said that I would have gone because I had a problem that comiletons had sex in the neighboring room.
The author A N Wilson explained sheelmic that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged bags.
But the truth was less funny.
I walked away.
Yes, run because I was suffering under systematic mubbing and threats.
Not because of my quite unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I was just shined for a reason - a reason that seemed to be an important advisor Margaret Thatcher's illuminator, and I support the conservative party.
Why do I mention this now?
Well, current reports suggest that a new generation of students of the low rights suffer under similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred on tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded the same equality protection that would benefit from sulphurs, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus of Christ College indicate that they are "displaced, personally attacked and declared for unwanted" due to their political views.
They call for a place in the equal rights committee of their College to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was worsen by a recently highlighted documentation about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which tories represented as an excentric and Neonazis.
It was shown amongst others by Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford University, who went in a Rolls-Royce and protracted with silver-coloured and silver-constituated Gehstock.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered "sünd bounds for the introduction of higher study fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Students Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is an increasing link trend in universities.
People believe that we're like the Bullingdon Club without having come to know us at all."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and historian student in Corpus Christ, who initiated the search for greater protection, is the view that such a climate is "unangebrating". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designed President of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, said that they have observed an increasing rejection to students of the low-speed rights.
"This is a danger for the intellectual discourage and for the wellbeing of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I heard such a minority.
As an incredible shy 18-year-old I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred on the Conservative Party had reached its height point.
In the previous year, Margaret Thatcher - a former student - had voted for the university to not give an honorary title because of shortages in the university.
The atmosphere would even have caused stalinists to be scared.
In the first days of the first week, when new students meet themselves and the tutors, I received a premature on the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors took part in the mob of Tory students not only, but even with joy.
Political topics such as the mountain worker strike, privateisation and refusal of the government of sanctions against the Apartheid regime of South Africa found their way to the wooden crops of the tutorium.
At my first of these events, I should translate French texts from the 18th century into English.
"Miss Wyatt", said the Tutor Harry Pitt (in the meantime dead), "Translate the first paragraph".
I stole in it.
Pitt was a small man with a face like cheek steig, and quite heated.
"Does thatcher followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?", he asked me.
The other students chicked.
In my eyes, tears walled up.
"I suggest that they take a few French hours during your leisure - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt called me.
I returned to my room with hanging head.
This evening I sat in the college alone when someone was easily typing to the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented itself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said kind.
Unfortunately, it's how it is.
Everyone who is suspected to be tory will be forced.
For me it's already bad enough, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is near, so it'll be worse for you.
Most tory stirsemesters suggest that they are members of the Labour party.
In a local pub, I later tried to betray me.
I meant that I wasn't in all the points with Mrs. Thatcher's opinion.
This trick should prove to be unacceptable.
A student in the philosophy, politics and economy, who, ironically, visited the Eton College, said to me, "You are the daughter of a Fascist Switzer."
You're mourned.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was pervers and dirty.
"How did Tories have sex?" asked me.
They hit each other, aren't they?
I felt how homosexual felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever manage to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet equality after the breakdown of the darkness?
Should I use the Labour party and suppress my natural trends?
The three years before me lay down, in front of my spiritual eye devoted to a feignfire of anxiety and insolation.
The only Tutor, who was open to Tory, was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
It was not only for him to be a conservative, but also because he had advised thatcher in matters of foreign policy and wrote talks for them.
He was just rare.
He hated the place, found him provincially and smallkared and rejected him for his marxist-determinist history perspective.
In 1997 he adopted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said me.
I started pending between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge in more enclosed friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unbelievable.
During his time in the 40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said small.
So something would never do, not in my city of dreaming towers.
Even my Communist friends always laying inevitable manipulations on the day.
His moisture eyes mourned.
Give the whole chance.
I'm sure you're just necking you.
It would break my heart when you went.
My frequent journeys to London made my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, too tory followers, had dealt with pressure and dismissed his convictions.
During a tutorium in the next week, when another story professor seriously claimed that I was "a enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was in secret with shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "girl laundry" and called them "old Trottel".
The relief took a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail into my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week.
My door was closed.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes my harps gave up.
When they went, I packed a bag and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You will be happy to call me a fantastic applause.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer in an educational institution under such intimidation and wickedness.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university who produced not only 14 tory Prime Ministers, but hiding behind an unserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of famousness"
During the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian Modemacher.
Somerset House, the former Residenz of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worth the accommodation of an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been acknowledged by the designer at opening the "Valentino Master of the Couture", a grand retrospective for which more than 130 skin coupons were compiled, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unchangeable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist "il signore" Garavani is, which couldn't have been written without its distant clinic.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the sticky and distant world of the adel.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be seen until March 3th, there is a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most read aristokration, starting from Prince Salimah Aga Khan, about the Prince Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophes of his social rise from the modemacher in Voghera city in northern Italy to the Idol of the international jetset.
It must not be of disadvantage in the adel.
"For the least they don't get their chicken on your wonderful carpet like doing some beautiful famouss from the pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s they lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the exfrau of "Heini" Thyssen, closely friendly with forgotten beautys such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always prefered the elegance of famousity.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Even the architectural model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the Modemacher.
For many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to him for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music recognized and felt its influence.
"All invited felt important and loved," the "Top Model" reminded her career during the week of Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes from the fashion because his designs are artworks," she concludes.
Mode view of origin
Garavani's life is not a story of disgusting, rather of mutual loves.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60 meters long runway, which suggests a role exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along to admire a dreamy "Audienz" that is the masterpiece of Valentino, such as the dress, the Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costume, which Monica Vitti had in "La Notte", or a mantel from wool and leather, who belonged to the Emperor Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion pops, names like Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía by Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modemacher, 2006
Many of these girls say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can remember perfectly.
It was a shirt, a shirt, a western kind of "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/Winter collection of 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designers' museums.
"I see him all others because of his great love for the women and because he exhibits our beauty," adds the Ex-Heroin of Feria.
I like the colors it uses very much; they have a lot of light and underscore the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and leader of the fashion of Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time when she wore a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to carry one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came to it.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a feast at the castle of my veter, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a wired upper part with a decolleté that honors his name.
"It was a true dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is not dependent on the fashion, his concern is timeless," explains this Italian Aristokratin, who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess D'Arenberg keeps its evening dresses of the Modemacher "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress but also the related memories".
The "monoy" of the fashion
The great final of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (such as the Modemacher called his closests) were necessary to produce this 11-seven-colored silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroideries and a four-half meters long sweif.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the special press, this dress was a milestone in the skin couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the clients of the upper society".
For years with the "savoir-être" of Elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, commander de L'Ordre of Art et des Lettres, excellent with the honoral legion, Garavani cumulates as many honors as each of the husbands of his clients.
"I'm always his refinement, his tranquility, his maintained and perfect out," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time before a month at a gala evening at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat on the table of the Gräfin Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"He was madellos; the time leaves no traces to him."
And this says a princess...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human workers of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and health on the game when they carry 70 kg of sulphur over the steen paths.
There are people for which their work is hell, and others are working wordally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by taking sulphur from the Vulcan Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
In this way, he must climb down to the ground of his scratch, where the gas that flows from the earth is reinforced in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones that can wheat up to 70 kilograms, he transports them into two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the abrupt paths of stone.
There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rise to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the Turtlent rate, keeping balance and carefully setting their steps so that they do not relax and crop.
They know that every step can cost their life, as it happened to a French tourist who crashed on the cawah ides of the cawah.
The minor workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocent for each kilogram of sulphur that they rebuild.
As soon as they arrive, they can run the way between the tourists who photograph them like circussafe and run three kilometers to the scale, which a mine society has set a little further below at an altitude of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been using the occurrences in the volcano since 1960 and (not better said) his workers who pay 662 Indonesian Rupee (5 eurocent) for each kilogram of sulphur.
This will then sell it to the petrochemic industry for every 10,000 ruins (83 Eurocent) because this mineral is widely spread in everyday life and used for the production of stainless steels, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamits and even for sugar leaking.
"As we usually carry 70 kg, we get about 4,000 ruling (3,8 euros), ", Anto explains that makes three routes a day normally.
For each route he needs three hours, which he is fully accomplished, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rulings (11,5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such an inhuman effort, but the threefold is from what he would earn with the field work.
"The dayelohn of the minor workers here, where 15.000 ruins are paid on the day at the coffee harvest (1.2 euros) and the average monthly income is two million ruins (167 euros) is very high," explains the carrier who worked as Maurer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rulings (6,2 euros) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto has married to Banyuwangi, a village near, and that for a reason that is so important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hinduists, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, hatred often, and his eyes are traveled because of poisonous gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has put his life on the Kawah Ijen on the game, whose sulphur has already left the first tracks during him, although he covers his face with a mask and special brille.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, hatred often and his eyes are traveled from the volcanic because of poisonous gases.
This is the price he must pay for the achievement of his dream.
"I'll work here for two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but punished young man could work as a tourist leader, cellar or receive a hotel, but instead he performs the work of a tragedy.
He shares a dirty wooden hat with other carriers and stands up every morning at two o'clocks, because the sulphur also flows out nights, where its characteristic yellow color blews in darkness.
The shadow challengingly, he rises in the light of a small front lamp on his helmet that he bought himself from his own money in the crater.
Approximately 400 dragers are loading the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite their great profits, the mine society has not mechanized the sulphur destruction to save costs, and delivers the carriers working on their own accounts and paying for weight no equipment.
They also receive no share in the 30.000 ruling (2.5 euro) of the tourists who want to photograph the volcanic and human tragedy of this natural park together with the entry fee of 15,000 ruins (1,2 euros).
"This work is for the animals and not for the people" protests Madrusin, a stimulant 42-year-old carrier, who has been working three decades since leaving school at the Kawah Ijen.
He is able to wear up to 110 kg and assured that he continues, "as long as it goes," because he needs the money for the education of his three children between 10 and 18 years old.
I won't go in pension, I'm gonna die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and juggle the eyes, when the wind suddenly rotates and the mine workers knocks into the thick pillars that rise up from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course other than the usual breath problems, arthrose, pains in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders who have deformed from the weight of the basket.
With the basket on his back, Unainik with its 53 years is only able to carry 50 kg.
Each day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks through a goat path between the fit to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres.
"I won't go in retirement, I'll die here because the volcano was my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth far from where some teeth miss.
From his five children, the elder also works as a sulphur carrier with his 30 years.
The time goes away, but the army holds generation on generation in one of the hardest professions in the world: those working as a human load on the cawah Ihen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporens shift the guilt for having no children, for career, stress and the cost of the real estate and children's education.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotian husband, you are my patriotic wife: Feel up our bourgeois obligation and we create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbons, but yet - or just so - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper sing, the local Proverbs such as "Schieben will be a "bao" (Laib) in the oven to make fun about the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who has rotated the video, realizes the hope that the advertisingpot reaches funny way to make attention to the problem.
Her creative head, Munro Hamilton, says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people into their "national duty".
This is something just for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the largest problem in this country.
We are the worst of the world in fort planting, so we noticed that it is a topic that we had to care for.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of parfuum with pheromones or the organization of Speed-Dating Senders (snapflirts).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not forced to succeed.
Therefore, we thought, why do we not make something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as a rap?
1.2 Children
Those who do not take this issue easily is the Government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends 1.300 US dollars for political measures to encourage citizens to get more children.
A package of the Government for Marriage and Parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends the maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything has had little success yet.
Singapore is a rich high-technological city state in the Southeast of Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 years - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporens get any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better training" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to marry except and to form a family significantly more options regarding life objectives and to set priorities," she explains.
These changes in social situations have contributed to the higher number of individuals and to the exhibitors of marriage and births whose result is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
At the same time, immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counteract the population's reduction, led to recessation in the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where the barely cascasted Xenophobia blooms against many new immigrants, especially against the Chineses who are criticized for keeping the wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also considered to be one of the reasons for the last year the Government Party in Singapore achieved its poorest voting result since independence.
Since the elections have been made an attempt to correct the problem with higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
She has already influenced the housing market.
The City Development Authority has started controlling the number of small apartments known as "shoes" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a large sales success.
However, the concern is that they can promote the lifestyle of the single one, and that they refrain from the construction companies to build large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate firm EL Developers, says that his "shoes" can sell much faster than larger living units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold more quickly around days and even weeks than the larger living units.
This leads them to be much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give the developers more clear orientations to which obstacles have been placed before, if they wanted to build too many small residential units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could make the way to an increase in the national birth rate, the discussions with the Singaporens working in the financial quarter are to be clear that they will not have a great effect.
"The people are strongly stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, why it is suspended by many" says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"For me it is important to have my own money and time," says another man, about 20 years old.
Men and women lead their career, stress and costs for property and education as a reason for having no children.
Therefore, the Singaporens have the last word when it comes to getting children - there the government can still do so much.
Offline Private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the property privately or "any area of private life where you are entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to its daily and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he succumbs when he reveals situations in the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five adolescents between 10 and 15 years of age, often on the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very own" at personal level and "on the password and user" when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets wouldn't give me known in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge when trying to explain the importance of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has two years old accounts.
"They are very confidential secrets, my mother may know it, but not all the world," he confirms.
On FB I load beautiful pictures or pictures of games high.
I also distribute my time with knowers.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not of me, or of someone who makes the dumb head," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscure photos, from nackts, from crimes, or to write political or violent comments.
Jorge assured to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Below, the mother who has the password at one of the accounts.
I called on Twitter to express me and write interesting Tweets.
"I don't know if someone answers me, I just load them up" he adds.
"The social networks are entertainable, I can quickly speak with relatives in the distance or with friends" he suggests.
He asked that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown one.
Even if someone recommends a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not to know 20 of those he has added to his friends list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something meant, for example music," he suggests.
According to the boy, no one has made him any propagation or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone is insulting me or demanding her from me, I simply give him a surgery from my user account."
José reported his request after he had read a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is not known to experiences today as Cyberbullying.
The knowledge of a friend was impressed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never learned who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim has not closed the user account.
"He just made it private."
Afterwards he explains a number of steps to securely configure a user account.
In contrast to Jorge, this boy would upload photos of friends in uncomfortable or terrible situations.
Yes, I would do that if he is unympathic to me or I want to interfere with him.
"But I know this is Cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher for English with a degree of education and learning, believes that in order to oriente children and adolescents, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master title in paedagogics at the University of Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these concepts for the explanation of the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and adolescents who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who should teach them where we still learn" he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, "because we require them to have a defined criterion about what can be published, published or said, and this in an age where the maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be selective if they are most important to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without considering the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach the children and adolescents, which is privacy, to ask them questions they think about.
"I say they shouldn't do it, does not work," he says.
Afterwards, Porras calls some ways: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to be pleased if you published a photo of you like that you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission if you labeled photos of celebration?
And another question: Should everyone know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to understand that they need to act online as they do it offline.
There are the same rules.
"Everyone outside of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, universities professor, basic teacher and educational consultants, commented that parents are unaware of reading the social network directives carefully.
If they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"Example age, or what to share or publish" he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You shouldn't be talking to strangers."
Final meeting of the Unasur meeting without publication of the statement of Lima
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the statement of Lima, which was previously announced and theoretical should be signed by the seven rulers present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VIth Order Meeting of the State and Government Heads of Unasur. Sources in the State and President Chances would, in the beginning, have stated that they would pass it after the clause, however, that it would be published at a certain time on the site of the Perui Government.
In questions about the text, they indicated that the contents of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, were presented to the press in short statements.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the picture of the presidential meeting was transmitted with the "Private Session, Limited Audio".
The few information circular among the journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the unasur's governments at the meeting, but not by the Peruian press speaker.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which was unacceptable for the hundreds of journalists of different national and international media that demanded more information.
Afterwards, the Peru Chair Office sent the media an e-mail with the "Following Declaration" of the Summit, but it was the statement of Humala and not the official document for the conclusion of the summit meeting.
In the past October Peru was the host of the III Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and also at this occasion, despite the pers, the so-called statement of Lima, which was previously announced, was just as little published.
On the official website of the ASPA you can convince that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Perun authorities stressed that the information systems were available for the journalists, but they limited access to information in a high degree.
The Summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment by the Court of Justice of Den Haag, which contributes a border conflict between two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH starting on Monday in Den Hague in the process of introducing Lima against Santiago to listen to the Plädoyers of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we are currently present to this international Court," said Humala along with his chilenic counterparty.
"Chile was, and it is still a country that holds itself in international law, seeks peaceful solutions for disputes, closes agreements and subjects to international courts," Piñera adds and greeted Humala with a hand pressure before the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that they were subject to the IGH after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which had been seriously infringed against the Bogotá Convention, in which it agreed to submit the judgments of this international court.
At the Summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the unasur since 2011 after the deposit of his President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The hosting president Ollanta Humala opened the conversations on the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The Head of State leaves the final document, which informed that 16 decisions were taken and the Guidelines for 31 projects between the South American countries have been set over an investment amount of a total of $17 billion.
To the decisions made, he said that the countries of the Unasur will take "conspicuous steps towards the objective of a South American citizenship to extend the decisions on residence rights."
He noted that measures would continue to improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity in the cities and against organised transnational crimes, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and to the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act together and efficiently in the case of natural disasters.
With the crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not accept triumphancing trains, but should serve to extend our production performance and to show our people a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give a number of 31 emblematic projects priority to improve the spacious links in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and conclude new economic forms," said the peruanic president in a read-in-read declaration.
Among these projects, five Perunians would be lying on the cross-section of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should ensure better connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide more details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country serves for its resumption in the Union of South American nations", currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region of prosperity and peace and good cohesion relations was another aspect which was emphasized at the summit meeting.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before the start of his participation in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict after a judgment of the IGH in question by Bogotá.
"Maybe I will meet with the President Daniel Ortega on the morning day," Santos said.
"We will check all these paths - they are not exclusively, and also the agreement with Nicaragua makes conversations with Nicaragua necessary", he underlined.
"I hope to be able to tell the President Placega that we will be decivilized and treated as well as respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they intend to be present at the office of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the Summit meeting, the Ministers of Defense of the Block also met in order to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which should be strengthened in dialogue and consensus regarding the defense of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the Presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn in the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
Today, the President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, participating in the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained the state television in Peru that the Europeans were "to be killed in the Second World War and to other conflicts" and "is practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a southern American citizenship that advances the unclean Member States.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andes Community; however, there are still reactive sectors that are trying to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also welcomed the redesign of the organization of American States (OEA) to reduce the influence of the countries of England and to take into account those signed by the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach are never obliged to something, and in contrast to this, we always sign the South Americans everything.
"It is indispensable that the inter-American Commission for Human Rights has its seat in Washington and is financed by the United States," he said as an indication of the political asylum, which Ecuador has granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but did not meet his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at its time there have been "motivated mutations that Assange would be delivered to a third country and not maintain its procedures."
He also criticized the Swedish justice that he asked him to negotiate in his national territory because of an supposed sexual delicacy, while "the Swedish justice allowed this through a video conference that could have been carried out through the Ecuador Embassy in London."
Correa explained that the risk is that the health and the mental condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since he is in our message, I didn't talk to him, but the ambassador informed me that he has a light problem with the lungs, but not serious," said Ecuador's Head of State.
However, it is the danger that he takes physical and psychological damage because he was caught in a close space and cannot perform physical exercises freely.
"That would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa stated that the solution for the asylum, which has been granted asylum since June in the Ecuador Embassy in London, was the grant of a free letter, which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He underlined that there have been discussions with London to find a solution for the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, we do not apply this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution for this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of procedures to various European instances," he explained.
And "When Britain grants this free letter tomorrow, this is my opinion."
And if Sweden heard Mr Assange at Ecuador's Embassy in London or from Skype, as it was allowed for Swedish law and, in other cases, the problem was done.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm himself as the defendant of the press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate, "the medium-sizedness, the wicked intention and the lies that forced the free opinion."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the wicked and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive and pressed after gain," he said.
In this sense he congratulated that Ecuador no longer is dominated by such journalists, "and also not by the banks or hegemonic and spice citizens' countries," and predicted that he will "deplate the revolution to continue the way into this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the unasur at least until its next elections, argued that the organism must remain "heart and not take any opportunism and no legally clothed stateship," because "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterover, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of Den Haag, which presented the maritime state hocity of Nicaragua to negotiate the marine borders between the two countries.
This judgment is currently not implemented.
It is a problem between a southern and a Central American state.
Conflicts are unavoidable, but they must be overcome in a common way.
They need to be fully treated so that they can be overcome and look forward.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the disputes between Peru and Chile in front of the same Court of Justice and said that "it is right for Latin America to call on international instances if both countries are obliged to take the judgment even if it is very hard."
As regards the possibility of kandidating himself for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to achieve its third mandate, he said that he saw this option "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it falls very difficult."
Correa assured that if he denied the elections in February 2013 he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never been interested in me personally, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the faith that I was guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to comply with this responsibility," he said.
If I had to win, it would be my last period as President, then I get back from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decisive," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he had traveled there for a planned routine treatment, and that he would expect him to go back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean a fall in the health of President Chávez," he commented.
Today, the ecuadorian Head of State participated in Lima at the 6th Summit meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Union in South American Nations (Unasur), which had ended with the call for higher regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Reason for death for AIDS is a too late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the research result was confirmed: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb was embarked," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried "to weaken off without a recognized success."
He hid it before his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to know about it; and this with such use that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is without doubt one of the oldest patients of the Civil de Guadalajara Hospital, in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment opportunities and more stigmata.
At that time, even the director of a IMSS clinic avoided themselves, "as it led to a baggage."
At that time AIDS was synonym for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
However, many people still come into the clinic, who know nothing about their disease and with which the virus has already damaged and exhausted their immune system, and the victims of opportunist infections are.
31 years after the appearing of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means the survival of a patient who takes the treatment time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information was supported by a recognized scientific publication in April this year.
The specialist for infection diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists concluded that AIDS was not death judgment, but the years of survival and quality of life from the degree of impairment of the immune system of persons at the beginning of the treatment, and that those larger opportunities that are not dry: up to 30 years when counting 200 CD4 and 50 years in a number of 500 CD4.
Simply stated, the above statements mean that, if aged 25, he will receive HIV-positive diagnosis in this sense, "may be 75 years old, as long as he is under control," said this expert.
In order to correctly adjust this progress, it must be reminded that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is average 76 years.
Even if mortality has reduced significantly over the past years (in Mexico, the number of persons who died in AIDS, from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA’s annual report), it is still right that 60 percent of patients who have died from AIDS have been killed in the national database.
Only in Jalisco died in 2011 255 people, and until May of this year there are 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
So why are people still dying on it?
- I think the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least over the past 12 years, we did not have any care problems with the medicines. The problem is that people are in far advanced state because they do not know their infection state, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a surprising statement: "New of ten patients will come to us when they already have a accompanying infection. To influence global mortality, premature diagnosis is needed, so all people in which this is necessary must be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal agrees to the experts and officials of Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also to patients such as Fabrizio who made his test at a private lab because it had made a friend of him who was already in the AIDS phrase and even the Kaposi-Sarkom (a cream-like tumor) which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they'll die and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, then better place three times," you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed myself well, drive sports and take the medicines.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, do much, have an active, but responsible sex life, I respect my health and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO, to animate those who are afraid today in the context of the world's AIDS day.
They should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsiblely like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condome behind the loading table
There are great holes between the health programmes and the simple citizens, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the matter of HIV.
And most important is prevention.
In the locations of that, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; before they were released individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces that are good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
Youths are among the risk persons for new infections.
"What do you need?" is a wide range of spots of social workers, educational staff in schools, employees in pharmacists and in the health system that young people do not want to suspend, assured the centrifugal.
He proposed that this inefficient distribution be reoriented; the condome should not only be behind the shop table, but in output equipment in public toilets of facilities that are often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
They should not be paid to the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González answered, whether preservatively distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like that; best it is to bring the condom closer to those who already exercise sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is nationally viewed at 4th place of new and cumulated AIDS cases, and 13th place relating to HIV.
92% of the infects occur on sex, 6% over blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people registered for each case that do not know.
After the United States professional court confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructure of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which was reached through a trade course in Mexico, an unhealthy precision for each national firm with offices in the neighbouring country has a problem of payment.
So it is possible to say that the procedures for survival of companies that allow mexican laws do not have validity in the State of Stars and Stripes in contradiction to international agreements.
In practice, on 15 June the judge Harlin Hale at the Court of Justice in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas leads to the unhelpful suspension of the Mexican companies of the occupation of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico's door and gate to call for three contests to the U.S. Supreme Court.
While the judge of the matter pointed out that the creditors must be subject to the United States' conciliation law, the Fifth Circuit’s apprenticeship court, seating in New Orleans, states first that it is the main course of trade treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation is not known in procedures for payment incompatibility of companies with a country-wide profile.
To this end, the United Nations Model Law was created for the uniformization of international trade law, with the American Law Institute was used as a lighter.
Secondly, the judgment does not determine that without the votes of the companies, after recognising the obligations in the case of the Vitro branches with their parent society, the necessary majority would have been achieved for the restructuring of liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case where this scheme was approved.
There are half dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by the Instituteo Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundes Institute for Trade Conferences).
It is also correct that after the votes of the branches, the believers of Vitro, who complained against Vitro's courts, i.e. the Geier Funds, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would expire 45% by 37%.
This shall not be taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is guilty for its difficult situation from 2008 under the major economic crisis in the United States which gave the country a complaint.
For this reason, the González Sada family contradicts the same appeal court so that the vote in the plenary will take place, i.e. by all judges, because only three were voting.
If it is not issued, the Cerciorare claims that require the verification of the procedure by a higher instance shall be lodged by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The difficulty in this case is that the court made a document that was sent by the Mexico Government under the figurea amicus curiae (freund of the court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro under the law on trade agreements, and notes that it had been strictly held to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with the Chapter 15 of the United States Concernal Law.
In addition, it is noted that the country has subjected to the principles of the Commission of the United Nations for international trade, i.e. the rules laid down for the cases of cross-border payment inability that guarantee equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambots: a hit for Vitro and the country.
General balance
After the ads by the Mexican trade unions for air traffic against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of an fraudian administration, did not come forward several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Working Association of Pilots) finally made progress.
The hypothesis launched by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now submitted a criminal proceedings against the National Bank and Securities Commission, which is prevented from disabilities of justice.
After that, the Supervisory Authority has systematically refused to inform the Republic's main administration about a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to retire the F/589 of the Bank IXE to the name Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesoes.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main actress of the Hotel Chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
A group of national and foreign environmental guardians, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the bourgeois society have decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we talk about a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, complemented with a living area for employees of 150 companies.
In the forefront, Canacintra (the national Chamber of Processing Industry) has reached to unite governors in the South East to resist the monumental institution, which defeated partly protected areas and represents the mother of all the threats of the industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a request from the Senat to explain the conditions and circumstances of the Mexican Embassy in Japan did not comply with the anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement known under the English abbreviation of ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual property.
As you know, these measures have taken place, although the Senate had not considered the possibility because he considered them infringement of the free opinion in social networks.
Homex long-term
In pursuant to pay long-term liabilities without any infringement of short-term obligations, the construction company Homex will market more than 500 million peers.
The emission is the first of four same emissions promising an interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
Based on the company NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading companies of information technology, a company group was founded under the name Competival, whose target is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are over 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Itin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world bomber of the basketball, Héctor "Itin" Reyes, was connected to Corbsport for more than 60 years and has prepared the whole world.
A few in Puerto Rico have a so great spiritual collection of the history of the basketball of the country like Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound to the wheelchair in 2008, Rexes was six years of this sport, unless it was a player of lower classes, players of the first national Liga, authors of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Association.
"My life has set up a lot of hates in the Basqueball, even several at the same time, when I was President of the BSN, head of the National Team and President of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes remembered at a visit by Primera Hora at home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his married wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerated with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional reminders are those who remembered from the middle of the 50s as players until 1982 when he celebrated his 15-year-old jubilee as a commerce leader or manager of the club.
"This was my best years I enjoyed most since since 1967, I was allowed to be part of the eight leaders of Vaqueros as managers, managers or trainers.
There were many fulfilling years, including five soldiers each other from 1971 to 1975.
And then I adopted with a Championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager", says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer and was appointed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m large player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse who had been indigenous and was one of our best yards.
I still know how he said that if Mincy had allowed a Championship for Bayamon to provide gausse for another.
The Championship of Vaqueros with Gausse was granted, but already from a distance because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At this time, he preferred to enjoy his completeness and those of Mincy in the national team.
I still know when we won the United States for the first time in the front-olympic tournament.
Afterwards, the World Championship in 1990, where we occupied the fourth place, what should actually be Bronze, if not the Canadian Schiedsrichter, who made us repeat the last move for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of World Championship 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
She belongs to the best as well as those who won the Dream team at the Olympic 2004.
My favourite, however, is the team of pan-American games in Cuba in 1991, where we won gold and offered the team of the USA a fight, as at that time they won against us at the World Championship Bronze.
At that team, not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, who were unable to be infected in 1990 by brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales.
A team that may not be the best for personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and who prepared us great joy was that of the Vorolympian tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the locked players because of the events on the Pan American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against each forecast.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
That was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this, without taking into account his course in the different lies in which he has played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a series of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best thing you've reached in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the National Team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s to 17 teams in a season.
What are you still going to do?
There are things I would have introduced, for example, the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the guys in Ponce, for example, play only in their territory and only meet in the national Playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessary many travels and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed trainings and courses for trainers, table officers and skedal leaders.
That's what I'm proud of.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, see videos of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and go to a basket ball game.
And of course, I enjoy the society of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and was famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R".
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oilmagnat J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of gierigness in the 80s, is dead.
He became 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new office of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complexations according to a press release of the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved town of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that most enjoyed him," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebration of the harvest feast.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and sequence series, was at Hagman when he died in Dallas hospital, said her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
He made joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full trains," said Gray in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosticed in 1992 by Leberzirrhose, and he admitted that he had drunk a lot over years.
In 1995, a malicious tumor was detected in his liver, and he was subjected to transplantation.
In the years ago "Dallas" Hagman was known as a nice type in television in 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Bezaubernde Jeannie" of the NBC television event.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life was put on his head when he meets a attractive "dish" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live at him at home.
He was also a performer of two comödies who were exposed only a short time, such as the Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinema works were among the critically well assessed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the splendidly despicable J.R., who made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of television chain CBS over the Ewing clan and other figures in its surroundings has been radiated from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising claim "Who shot on J.R.?" was to create expectation for an epide full of emotions, where Hagmann's figure was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were won in dairy houses.
Thus the series reached a viewer record in that time.
When the answer was known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers, the "Dallas" changed to the second most viewed entertainment program since the end of "MASH" 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, J.R. (interpretated by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had weakened and threatened to present it as prostitute if they did not leave the city, but others also had reasons for trying to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, indispensable man with a charismatic smile: a retaining businessman and untreu husband who strived to inject his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on J.R.' said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, the director of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "enormous personality and outside the screen".
He is unforgettable and unforgettable for millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts who were lucky to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were exhibited a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second staff was completed, and a sixth chapter was just rotated, the sender informed.
From Warner or TNT there was no immediate explanation of how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Geboren in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a youth when she received Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
From 1952 to 1956, he tried to get lucky to the theaters in New York, then he served in the aviation forces in England.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the kalifornian city of Malibu, where many famousities have their residence.
In 2001 he called his memories "Hello Darlin: Number (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I wrote nothing from which I thought it could harm someone or affect him any wise," said the Associated Press of his time.
After the hepatic transplant, he worked for livers and worked as a volunteers in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations stand up and afterwards," he explained 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "no fear, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but it'll go well."
He was also opposed to smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course that studys the "Ende of the World"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and cuisine and global warming.
Each semester when the religious professor decided to hold a course over the end of the world, he knew that he had an unreleasant fishing haken: the end of the "long return" of the Maya calendar on 21 December, from which many people believed that it was the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what should expect him in the following two months: the destructive Hurrikan Sandy, some called "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict in the participating of Israel, the place where the Christian theoretics believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I have not found that this will be the most apocalyptic semester that has ever been there," Charmé said this week the students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If someone analyses what happened today in the world as if we were about 30 days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds that the bad good is for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who should actually be the last in history offers courses about the "Ending of the World".
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Medien, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and cuisine and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas spread out with time," he said, as well as the way in which hypothetic scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month the students analysed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they were compared to the real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what possible, probably, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
At the headcampus of the University of Pennsylvania, Matthew Restall, professor of Latin American history, and his colleague Amara Solari, a co-professor of art history and anthropology have formed a team to offer a course with the clear name "The End of the World".
"We don't take up 2012 so that we always keep the option to retain the course, in case the world is not undergoing," said Restall.
Despite the "preliminary destruction" the students must study, create projects and participate in final tests.
In Penn State, the final test will be carried out at the front of the apocalypse, why the students have no other opportunity to "work until the night, where the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places" said Restall about his course for students with a high average of 35 students.
We received e-mails from students for weeks before semester started, who asked if there were more places free.
The students on the other hand assure that the course is the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
In fact, the apocalyptic sekte or religionsmentality is only a question of comfort or lack of it.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa explains psychology and health care to have seen all apocalyptic films.
"Not I have heard something from a lesson where this is being taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students - and less a professor - explained to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of Mayas, and in a certain way we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, students last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that the Western society is an apocalyptic fear that brings several centuries back when people responded to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"On the other hand, people don't think like that," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of the University of La Salle, who informs the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course about the end of the world there.
"The Philippines don't participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an enemy on an exception of a higher instance.
We have a pregnancy from the Pope.
Overall pointed out that many days was spoken from the last court over the years, and said that if on December 21, the people weren't going to think about a new date, "or about the fact that the 21th of December was the beginning of a seven-year period, that the end of the world was coming.
Students and professors easily take this date.
Several people said they want to go to celebration about "the end of the world".
"Perhaps I call some friends so that we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
