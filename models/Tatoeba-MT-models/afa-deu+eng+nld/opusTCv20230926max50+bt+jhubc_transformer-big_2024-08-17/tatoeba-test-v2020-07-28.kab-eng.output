Get rid of the problem, please!
Eat well.
She couldn't understand why she was so upset.
I'll go tell him.
Have you ever written an article on wikipedia?
There was an empty room in the house.
Why didn't anyone respond?
Tell 'em.
"Please tell him to leave.
Where's you are?
He didn't fight, he didn't stay.
Do you think I can be seen by anyone?
The slave likes the day.
He was fighting with Mary.
Let's talk a little bit.
Mary and I are going to do this today.
Where did you get all the keys?
Is there something that bothers you?
You're not my friend, are you?
Can't we hear that?
Would you like to join us at the table?
It's a great way to get the cat to eat, so hurry up!
Get your hands off my ass!
Blacked out!
Wash your hands.
Listen to it well.
Where were you on October 20 at 2:30 p.m.?
Sam asked her if she had a friend.
"Get your hands off me.
Are you afraid?
He wants to build things.
He's been waiting for three hours.
Do you want to sell your house?
I don't agree with your mistakes.
Aren't you scared?
Someone's just arrived.
Get out!
I've always liked mistakes.
I think there's someone in the room.
He wants to leave now.
"Everybody loves Tom.
I just want to see my new car.
"Could you bring me something to eat?"
He lives with his wife in London.
What's the matter with her?
Don't get me started, get out of the house!
I was sent a word.
He kissed my body.
"Do you speak Latin?"
Did you hear what they said?
He asked me about Mary.
It's new.
"I'm calling my brother.
Tom was in a bad mood.
Learn! Learn!
He knows more than that.
You've told us.
Tom's been drinking.
She hated him.
There were ions.
Tom and I were in the same place.
Do you believe that?
No one knows what will happen in the future.
I'm a writer.
Let's be fresh!
She didn't know what to say to Leah.
I've never been to Paris.
The truth is, they didn't believe it.
Don't give up on others, let them take care of themselves.
Do you like to play basketball?
It's better to go home.
I just got back from the box.
Do as I told you.
He's checking them?
One part of his story is true.
He has until October 20th to complete the report.
She knows how to sing very well.
Do you think you'll be able to see me?
Keep your teeth out!
What's that?
Love will make you blind.
I want you to open the door when you leave.
"We want our money.
Tom's wife left him in October.
He hasn't been here since October.
"Where's Tom coming from?"
Go back to back.
He's afraid of the world.
I hope you'll get a quick response.
Get away from me!
I don't see very well.
He told me I'd ride.
Give it to you.
He didn't stop talking.
She works day and night.
There's someone already here.
There's somebody in there.
That's the reason for that.
Everybody's dancing.
"Someone's been calling to see you.
I waited for you, but you didn't come.
I like it now, too.
She didn't help.
Gen!
Someone else might be able to do it.
Take this.
Since when.
I'm pleased with your letter.
She said she'd come back.
I like the apples.
Someone's been calling you.
"I only asked for coffee because I wasn't hungry.
It needs to be good for a good run.

I'm dying.
This way.

You're all sick.
I don't think it's going to be a burglary.
He was a free man, but he could have been a free man.
He's just arrived.
Can you find it ?
As John Louis Aubert once said, "If you have joy in your heart, you will soon find happiness; and whoever rejoices at what happens, you will find it won't hurt; it will hurt a little."
You've survived?
Were you surprised to see it?
We are farmers.
"I'm not Tom's mother.
Do you know a man named Green?
Keep looking at it!
Please don't forget what we said.
I really love you .
You're pissed, Tom!
Give it to whoever you want.
Do you have a house in Australia?
Tom is very tall.
We did it.

He went to the hospital to change things.
Are you ready to come to me?
That's the YES!
I love you very much.

He met a lot of people when he was in New York.
I'm listening to the music.
I hope for a year of peace and prosperity.
Eat the steaks with salt.
They will live forever.
She began to sing.
This boy is adorable.
Why do you want all of these things?
Tom went to Mary's.

Let's play some game.
Well, I don't care at all.
Sam's life was in the hands of Laila.
Who's then?
There was someone knocking on the door.
Can you tell me a little something, please?
They know why.
Who told you I couldn't swim?

Purchased!
You're being punished?
Tom was killed by a bad meal.
"I ate when you called me."
You'll be happy if you continue to work like this.
You are a dog.
She's rich, isn't she?
I don't think you're too bad now.
I don't know what I'm doing.
That's the way Tom does it.
Why shouldn't I eat that?
Keep on singing.
You can continue to work in a place like this.
Somebody's singing.
What if you've seen someone?
Tom works in the library.
She was meeting with Mary.
Have you ever played with a dog?
you're mad?
That's what love is?
I need someone to listen to me.
Oh, my God!
Let me out of here!
Can you get ready for the night by car?
I can't hear that anymore.
Take me home to.
"Stay with me a bit.
It was raining.
When are you going to eat?
Get out now.
Don't you have any luck?
Do you say or do you work?
Take her to the house.
Sami's car will be refurbished tomorrow.
He bought a lot of books.
Tom's party was on October 20th.
It took me a lot of time.
Keep on reading.
It's not a good Monday.
It's working.
He asked Mary to show him the picture she had taken.
Tell me something I don't know.
He was released from prison on October 20th.
They've got friends.
My baby's hurt.
I'm staying at home today.
I think we need to remember Tom.
I'm not right?
Someone entered the room.
But it wasn't just Tom who did that.
What's the price of wine?
We're thanking you all.
The spring has come.
Put them all out.
It's an exaggeration!
You're sniffing at him.
Can anyone tell me why I'm so upset about it?
Tom is a good boy.
Thank you for your kindness.
Are you glad you're going to Portugal?
Has anyone seen anything at all?
I like to sleep.
Get on your own.

Oh, put on your clothes!
I continued to read.
My skin is very good.
You're dancing.
Where's yours?
Tom is running.
He left Mary.
I'm ready to pay now.
You've got to tell somebody.
That's what he told me last week.
That's the solution.
Sami Layla is on Facebook.
I know you're writing a book.
Just ask me!
Try to keep up with Tom.
I don't think he speaks French all the time.
I like to go to the music festivals.
Sam likes to talk about it.
Tom nodded.
I'll never be rich again.
Tom grabbed the door.
He lives in Los Angeles with his parents.
Get started now!
Do you think we will succeed?
I'd like to find out where the money is hidden.
You don't really have a face to say what you think.
You are at home.
There is no word for water.
Do you want to go to Boston tomorrow?
They've got companies.
"Shut up!
Please wash your hands before you eat.
I don't care about all of Boston.
Did you check them?
Go back to your place.
Where are we going?
The aquarium is estimated to be at least 30 percent of the CO2 emitted in the atmosphere.
I've deleted a record.
Leave it to you!
How do you look like that?
The sun wasn't a burden.
I know this place.
My mother cut off the tree.
Someone is going to see us.
They didn't say a word.
The wind blows.
"Can I swim here?"
Where's the other pictures?
It's worth the words.
You like it to you.
You need to get a good rest.
Tom was very upset.
He said he didn't want to leave Boston.
I was not a woman.
He's been married since then.
Layla opened the door.
Do you want to tell it?
He didn't say how he got there.
Someone's broken his neck.
So, what do you want?
How many people are going to the hospital to get out of the house?
I don't speak your language.
You've got a lot of friends.
Tom always leaves the books to Mary.
You say it well.
She's very sane.
They came from a town.
I've been very busy.
Somebody's out there.
Don't give up, baby.
Mary laughed, though.
Laila and I were scared.
Why don't you go see Tom?
This happened on the night of Halloween.
I'll do it again.
I was surprised by the news.
Tom and I talked about a lot of things.
I've got something.
Life is still ahead of you.
He started working here on October 20th.
Well, you can come in.
Seems to be older.
Let's get this up!
Run more than that!
Tell him that I love him.
Tom was running in the cold water.
Somebody's been eating them.
He told me a story you don't believe.
Mary didn't drink when she was cooking.
The dog said to him, "Why don't you get tired of being hungry?" and he said, "I'm tired.
It's beautiful writing.

There's someone watching.
She didn't want to help Mary.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry," he said, "but I've got my hair cut, and I've got my hair cut, and I've got my hair cut."
He lacks a sense of community in his life.
Did anyone know anything about it?
He just gave it to me.
Sam was a bad person.
You're the one who's lying, not me.
Tom thanked me for the post.
I'm not a good mother.
I'm working at home with Tom.
I've got my reasons.
I don't want to go to a company.
I have written a lot in French.
You're really talking about Tom, aren't you?
He was successful.
That's what I like reading.
He was married to Mary.
I think he's dirty.
I'm sending Tom a message right now.
No one is going to smoke here.
Somebody's got me.
How many times a day do you eat?
He's bothering me.
Do you know the book?
Stay up-to-date!
I don't like my French teacher.
When are you going to come home?
What do you want to tell me?
Whoa, you!
Don't call the police.
She asked him to come home.
Mary was killed by him.
There's nothing in his place.
Can you get to 9?
Sammy had forgotten about it.

"Can you read that?
They've never said anything about that.
Some of them are different, but some of them are more popular than others.
Mary and I both know who we are.
It's a Proud!
You have to apologise.
He wants me to.
We're ready to fly.
"I can't remember your name.
Don't stop the lies.
"Does anyone speak French?"
I didn't think of Mary.
Do it again.
I've been waiting for an hour and a half.
I woke up Tom.
He didn't see you.
She was blind.
He said he had a day off.
Somebody wants to talk to you.
Take it! Take it!
"Do you have a dictionary today?"
Open up your books.
It's easy to swim.
She said she doesn't need a man.
You are the wise.
You've continued to agglomerate.
It's a good job!
Mine is bigger than yours.
Don't come into my room without a shower.
I just didn't care.
Millie is eating bread.

Well, I was playing.
Don't forget your phone.
Please tell me who's going to help us.
Tom was on his way.
You need to be careful when you're on the fence.
No one would listen to it.
She lied to Fatima.
I'm trying to call Tom.
"Do you want eggs?"
Sam wanted to eat.
I think I should say thank you.
"Where were you this morning?"
So you're on your own?
Open up your eyes!
Just stay away from it.
"Why did you come now?
I have two brothers and one brother.
They're all singing.
Tom nodded to Mary.
"Shut up your room!
Shu-t.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
Tom ack-it.
Let's hope for the lives of those who live in Kathmandu.
We're in the middle of a school.
He turned to Mary in anger.
What do you think they should do?
Tory is dead.
"You can swim.
Tom was so jealous.
Don't you remember!
I'm so much for you.
I don't know why I'm looking at this.
She's running computers.
I forgot I didn't call.
I can't eat that alone.
"Please tell him to come in.
You love the sound of Kathleen.
Sam is a human.
What do you think about the amount of food you've eaten last week?
The summer is over.
What type of writer do you like?
You're driving it!
I've sent you a few messages.
It wasn't easy for you to get the job done.
Let's go tomorrow.
"Where are your dogs?"
Tom's gone down.
Take a look at this, please.
Just be patient for a minute.
Go on, you're going to die!
Did you hear what they said?
There's someone I see.
Don't worry about you.
You're not making any mistakes.
I'm glad you waited for me.
You can ask them if they want one.
Please do as I said.
What is the name of Tom's family?
They have a lot of money.
It's the spring.
Please don't leave.
Who's who?
I'm flushed.
It's crazy!
"You can call me tonight if you want to."
He had never seen my face before.
I've heard someone scream.
I'm going to Boston in October.
You're crazy.
It's hard to see a cry.
Believe in me!
Lucy has a lot of friends like me.
I've bought it.
I can't wait to see Tom's Halloween costume.
you're hurt?
When did you really get to work?
"Did you see the smile?
I've got something to give you.
He's lying.
"Can you call my mother, please?"
Do you have a lot of headaches?
You don't put a finger on Tom's money.
It's better to stay home when it's raining.
You're going to sleep if you continue to work in a place like this.
I'd say he's nice.
There's someone who wants to talk to you.
It's so beautiful!
I don't have the patience.
"Please let me out, please.
"Call again.
She's getting married in October.
He wants to get it back when he's done.
Tom's drinking beer.
Do you understand?
No one has ever seen you come here.
Mary's family loves her.
She didn't care what Mary did.
I guess I'll all be waiting.
"Hello, ser!
I went to Boston on Monday.
I think you did it without realizing it.
It's over with me.
You talked to them, didn't you?
Let's go and cheer up!
Go back on!
We're all rich and beautiful, but we don't know what to say.
I prefer to work at night.
Let's just get them together.
I'm actually using this one.

"Why are you reading this?
Go home early.
"Did you see the star?
They say it's snow.
I can't swim as fast as you can.
The two of them, Fran.
Maybe someone will listen to you.
"Are you Japanese?"
I've been freaking out.
Come with me now.
I'm wondering where my hope is.
Leave it to be sweet.
It's her birthday tomorrow.
I'm going to sleep.

We don't speak French.
"Where did you find my paraphernalia?"
He likes to watch football.
They're angry at the people you're talking about.
I think there's something I've heard.
"Did you know Tom?"
She's moving faster than Mary.
I forgot my birthday.
It would be nice if you could come and live with me.
Get on the road here!

As a new friend was born, a translation is not a photograph of a language in other languages. It is an emotion that will lead to a knowledge base that will make it more popular, more powerful.

When I went to school, it was still in the air.
Go! Go!
Go back to work.
Smile!
You've been stupid.
Those who say that they are right are the ones who give it to the poor.
Can anyone tell me why I'm so angry?
She hates him.
It's Proud!
I've lost hope.
Do you believe in the truth?
Be a slave and stay a slave.
Take care of me, Tom.
Choose!
The Kisses!
That's going to be awesome.
"I understand Tom.
I know it's Tom's story.
I'm going.
Do you want me to open it now?

That's because he's here.
You're bitches!
I like to read.
Don't stop learning!
He's only got one thing.
You're going to hate the Algerians.
He was a singer.
I didn't have any coffee.
I can't hide what I'm feeling.
You've cried, my friend.
You're the bosses.
I've heard it, but I don't really know what it is.
She's embellished me.
What time is it when you're here?
Today is the 20th of October.
"Have you read this book yet?"
Aren't you a little too young for this?
I'm sure Mary didn't do it herself.

I love someone who sent me a letter.
I know you're missing it.
He's eating grass.
Eat and eat.
I've heard someone talking.
I'd like to help if I can.
Were you surprised to see it?
I thought I'd do it yesterday, but I didn't.
I don't know why Tom didn't do the job.
Have you ever wondered how many stars there are in the sky?
There's some squirrels on the table.
"Did anyone call you?"
Eat it!
You're new?
"How many times did you go swimming last year?"
Go to your bed.
Tom is almost dead.
He died on October 20, 2013.
Everything has changed.
Why don't you call someone?
There's someone waiting for you.
I want someone to talk to.
I'm asleep, are you?
I didn't think it was just a word.
What do you want to read?
It's snowing.
You can run as fast as you can.
Are you a fool?
I'm going to tell Mary to come with me.
What did they say?
Feel like you're fine.
Tom and I are in agreement.
You can talk, can't you?
Tom couldn't get away.
Your work is in the computer.
Are you sure you're going to leave without saying goodbye?

I want to live in France.
"You need a good woman.
We like to sing.
Call the police.
I know you're a dentist.
We were driving slowly.
It's a good day, isn't it? why don't we go out?
Tom would have to agree.
Come on in here.
Somebody stole it from me.
Tom was trying to.
You don't have to be like that, man!
He was angry with Mary.
Do I have to leave?
Do I have to ask a question that doesn't work?
"There's got to be someone here.
At least if it's true!
I hope no one will follow you.
I've been waiting for lunch.
Obviously, we can do that.
It's not that hard to do.
You've tried.
I'm ashamed of her.
Aren't you coming here?
"Are you sick?
You've ruined your country.
Sammy is drinking red wine.
We met at the airport.
They've caught him.
Where do you live now?

He didn't find himself.
He said he'd continue to ask questions.
Smells.
She's lying.
He knew how to kiss.
When you're finished, brush your teeth.
Tom reinstalled the software that was deleted by mistake.
We were swimming in the river yesterday.
Give me your opinion.

I'll let you out soon.
I didn't know how much I missed you.
Sustained.
I'd rather have bought more than one.

It's just talk.

Do you like it with Tom?
You are part of the problem.

Stay on the word!
He was released from prison on October 20th.
He wanted to take care of Mary.
Tom was impressed.
I was in Boston in October.
He needs someone to help him.
"Who went with you?"
There's someone who's running around.
I can't grow up.

It's hard to be happy.
"There's something you're reading.

Someone's been looking at Tom.
Wait for me!
We can't do it without Tom.
Who's got him?
"Have you all found yourself?
If you want to swim, swim.
Everyone called him Jeff.
"What happened to Tom?"
I don't know why he did that.
What do you call it, my friends?

"You're very angry with Mary.
Did you know that it's Kathmandu?
Who did you go with?
He likes to be in London.
Why don't you eat now?
There's something wrong with him.

I want to kill Mary.
"Give me the football!"
Now, listen to it!
He was with Mary.
Looks like he's not in the class.
"What did you learn, Tom?"
I'm speaking the Korean language.
Someone's got to call him.
He said he had written the book for the last two years.
He knew it was too late to call, but he did.
The silence of the night has left us.
MST.
Everyone's happy.

Is there anyone who's hurt?
Hello, my father.
He built a very big house.
It's good use.
There's someone already here.
She was working on Mary.
Someone should be able to stop you.
I cut it in two pieces.
Happy!
Tell her about it.
I've corrected the sentence.
I've done half the work and now I can rest.
What's your plan?
Tom is joking.
I think there's something I've heard.
Tom and I are going to school.
"My name is Joseph, and I'm called Joseph.
I don't know if you're going out alone.
I haven't eaten for three days.
No one is dead.
Tom said that Mary is still living in Boston.
We were kids at the time.
He worked for three hours at a time.
Let's go.
I haven't finished my school yet.
"Come on!
You're here.
Hello, what's your name?
I didn't try anything.
Wrong.
You want to know what you're doing in your life.
This is the one that said to me, "I'm going to go out, I'm going to go out."
Is it the owner of this house?
I love him like a mother.
Tom woke up.
"When were you in Australia?"
Do you think he's going to let Mary do that?
Ask one of the kids to see you first.
He's got Mary.
Who's going back?
Just look at it.
Who's found you?
I thought my wife was a fool.
Someone had tried to kill me.
You're Hungry?
But she's trying to talk to me and I'm going to talk to her.
Are you at home, too?
Shut up, please.
You're good at everything.
Let's get to Layla.
He gave his beer to Mary.
Did you buy them in your mind?

The sky is very clear at night.
Tom has broken up with me.
What can I get you for a drink?
Hey to yourself!
Clean up your clothes.
It's not helpful to use this dictionary.
He left his job on October 20, 2013.
You're too self-sufficient!
I want someone to talk to.

I was wrong.
Don't let anyone burn in the fire.

I've felt that.
Oh, the caf<0xC3><0xA9>!
Have you been at the restaurant for the past week?
Someone's been driving my car.
The event took place in Boston.
She wants to marry Mary.
I'm afraid of Tom.
I'm not sure what I'm seeing.
"Why don't you call him when he remembers you?"
I'll dream of you.
You don't speak French, do you?
What's wrong with doing that?
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the coronavirus is a virus.
Make sure everything's.
He's hiding something.
Go for a run.
Are you an Englishman?
I'm looking just like you.
It's good for you.

Have you ever played this game with Tom?
I've just received your letter.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He's got wine.
"Are you going to swim today?"
He wrote a letter that he loved.
Shut up!
Don't talk about anything!
"How many languages did your wife speak?"
I've never seen anyone like him.
Can you take a picture with me?
No, thank you.
Well, let me show you something.
He likes to sing.
I'm going to find someone.
Just like I see you.
You found him waking up.
"How much bread did you eat?"
Sam said he'd seen it.
He could do that, couldn't he?
Tom has a very nice girl.
If there aren't enough students to go to college, you'll have to cancel the school.
I listened to him when he was angry, but he didn't listen to me.
It may be far away.
You've seen the birds.
I don't think you'll ever forgive me for doing that.
I'm going to send you a memory card from Boston.
Do you see what I want to say?
"Someone's killed Tom.
"I'm sorry you lost.
I want to talk to you again.
She fell to the ground as she passed by.

He didn't read the music.
I hope to see you again.
Someone's been watching Tom.
She was dancing with Mary.
We can kill you.
He didn't let me sleep.
If he hadn't eaten before, he might have eaten with you.
"When are you going to see me?"
Is there anyone who's been calling you?
You think I should do that, don't you?
Don't make it.
You've been warned!
I'm a writer.
Good luck with your new job.
You've won!
It'd be better if I left.
My brother played the guitar.
Somebody's been eating me.

You're crazy?
Let's get something to eat on the way home.
Do you want me to go with you?
Sit down.
Why do you need a piece of paper?
He said his son was a good boy.
Would you like to listen to your voice, please?
Smell that.
They've never been there alone.
I'll dream of you.
She's going to find her husband.
I'm not much older than Tom.

I don't know anything about the potatoes.
Who's got you in French?
So, when's your birthday?
"Do you speak French?"
"Please be quiet.
What's happened to your phone?
They didn't say a word to me.
Don't stop the amusement.
It's a good day!
Don't worry about that, Tom.
They've won.
If you want to eat it, you can.
I've been robbed of my money.
I'll call you when I get to Chicago.
We will be back in Boston on October 20th.
A fool!
No one said that.
I'll call you on Monday.

I got my car this morning.
Tom's a fool, he's a fool.
Why do people want to go to the movies?
You've given me a word.
There's someone waiting for you.
The paper is very easy.
He's still looking for him.
Tom felt like he was alone.
I have a brother who lives with you.
I thought you couldn't read it.
Close up your eyes.
Don't have any questions?
The Albanian word for "terfezia" can be derived from the Berber name for "tirfas", the majority of "tarfist". In Algerian dialect, it is referred to as "terfass".

Is there anyone who can help?
What do you think they should do?
He lived with his aunt.
Oh, how I miss you!
Well, I can't remember.
"When can we go swimming?"
I'm not happy with this because I'm writing a book.
Is there anyone who can help me?

Do not be afraid.
After we ate, we went for a walk.
Dance! Dance!
Tom didn't say anything.
Welcome to you!.
"What are you doing tonight?
You're making fun of me like that?
Please, please, do something for me.
Don't apologize to me.
Don't you have something to do?
Tom was relieved.
Stop with them.
You're in a hurry.
You're kidding me?
There's someone who's running around.
He said he wanted to speak French.
I'd have to show it to someone else.
It's all in French, but it's all in French.
I have finished reading the book.
God will be like you, and He will be like you.
How?
Why do you want to say all that?

I've tried them at home.
I'm afraid for you.
This flight can fly up to 800 miles per hour.

Do you think he killed himself?
That's yours?
Somebody's just called.
Thank you for trying us out for dinner.
Tom is a badass.
I was in Boston on October 20th.
"Please respond to me in French.
Tom was impressed with his performance.
Somebody wants to talk to you.

When did you think you were going to leave?
You've been dreaming too much of a dream!
"I know you're here."
He said he'd come home early in the morning.
See you at the library tomorrow.
Tom bought a flower for Mary.
When are you going to come home?
Don't stop aging.
He couldn't help Mary.
We're hoping to help you.
Is There Any One?
Sam didn't know what was going on here.

"Do you like me?
Do you understand why he's saying it?
He kissed me from the mouth.
Tom wanted to run away.
We don't understand anyone else.

You've turned on me.
You've come back.
I'm going to be reading a lot of books this year.
He thinks he's sick.
Will you stand up, please?

Sometimes he comes home from work to work.
I want someone to talk to.
Look at us!
The word is over.
Maybe someone else will be hurt.
"You have two faces.
Who told you that it didn't work?
Someone's been calling you.
There's something you're hiding.
Call to the home.
So, what do you think?
Keep on keeping on!
"I don't think you're in Australia.
Tom's a car.
I wish you knew how much I hate you!
Tom and Mary are the same age.
Will you open the door, please?
"I like Australia.
I'm waiting for someone.
Do you know how to speak English?
- What's that?
You've got a good time.
She cares about him.
It's much bigger than Mr. White.
I've always lived in London.
I don't think anyone has seen you here.
You're all alone.
Where are you?
I'm always in London.
He was in the middle of the room and sent a message.
I think you're wrong.
They may have told me.
"Can you pass me a spaghetti?"
"You're back in Tibet?"
Looks like he's still tired.
That's very lucky.
You have to make sure that he doesn't do that today.
Maybe it's best if you come with us.
I haven't had any milk yet.
I want to warm up.
It's going to rain.
Keep on going.
I'm going to sleep.
Wait! Wait!
The good and the bad are always there.
No one opened their eyes.
It's only Tom and Mary who live in Canada.
It's hot today.
"Do you eat bread every day?"
Do you sleep?
Amen to Tom.
Nothing's happened.
I don't know if I believe it or not.
Let him do that.
"Can I talk to you alone?"
It's going to be a tactic.
"Listen, please, please.
I'll try to help you.
He's always looking out for his neighbors.
Tom came by himself, without Mary.
I'm sending you something.
Some people say that the monastery was a monastery.

What do you like to do?
It's all where it should be.
He was angry, wasn't he?
Is there anyone who can help me?
I love you both.
What do you think Tom is saying?
Listen very carefully to what I'm saying.
Your idea is bigger than yours.

It's a good idea to write a book about Kathleen.
I hope to be back on October 20th.

Squeeze yourself.
Can you do that to us?
Both of you have to go.
She knows how to speak Japanese.
"I'm not your slave.
They were well on the train.
The man was caught on the tongue.
There's nothing you can do to help.
Kathleen's language is rich.
He's out there, isn't he?
Get rid of the problem, please!
I don't know where Tom is.
No one knows what will happen tomorrow.
"Did you read?
Tom's family wanted him to stay.
I like to travel.

He's approaching Tom.
"You're crazy?
"Someone wants to scare you.
There are two books out of this book.
They didn't tell me.
Are you coming back from South Africa?

I'm going to Australia on Monday.
Can't you stop to help?

He came out of the river.
I need a piece of paper.
You've got to eat now.
Thank you for helping me every time.
"How many books have you read?"
It's really you?
He's getting old.
You can't leave me like that.
No one is dead.
There's something missing.
Thank you for trying me here.
Are you waiting for someone?
Who's running?
He's going to come?
You're always wrong.
I had a cup of coffee.
You're writing a letter?
I wear my hair every month.
Tom needs me, too.
Let the Dogs Get Rid of It.
Now you can take care of your daughter.
It's too much!
"How many times?
Who's using Tatoeba on your computer?
She helped to help Mary.
I'm tired of your complaint.
Tom has changed his mind.
Tom and I went to the party.
No one has ever seen you do that.
I'd like to visit Boston in the spring.
Give me a steak.
"What do you like more meat or fish?"
Well, maybe somebody wants it.
Who's got it going on?
Don't I have to work tomorrow?
"When did you come back from Boston?"
"Have you found yourself?
Now that I'm older, I'm thinking about something else.
I want you to shut the door when you leave.
I don't know what else to say.

How'd you get your coffee?
You've got a lot of teeth in your mouth.
I haven't seen him since.
We're not agreeing.
I hope to be back on October 20th.
The day is already here.
I wonder where she was.
He never gave up his money.
I always walk on foot.
Tell me something about it.
Please, please don't die.
He said he didn't hear what Mary was saying to him.
I think we can help you.
Oh, my friend...
Quit!
Tom sat down.
Somebody stole it from me.
Did you really think he was going to stay in New York?
If I were you, I'd go home and get some rest.
Some of what you're saying is stupid.
Tom and I went to the party together.
Do you believe the stories?
He's going to stay.
Do you want to live in peace with your religion?
Aren't you hungry?
Look to yourself.
Is there anyone here to help me?
She couldn't save Mary.
He lives with his mother in London.
There is GOD.
You've probably lost them all.
Tom is lying.
Who's going to take his place?
I'm afraid of Tom.
I've got mine.
Tom and Mary are here to help.
Give it a go for Tom.
Someone's trying to kill you.
They all agreed.
I told you I didn't do it.
I've got something that I can't stand.
You're a cat?
Don't worry.
Champagne, please.
Where's the kids from?
The world is a small town.
Is there anything else?
You need to ask someone else.
I hope no one has seen us.
Plants are growing.
Sami is running out of steam.
How much are you going to go?
I hope no one saw you like that.
I'd like to know more about your country.
I don't hate French.
He was brought back to work in October.
No one will ever see you.
Please don't call me.
Tom responded in great detail.
It's going to be too late today.
The church has 10 members.
Do you think he loves me?
Good night, my mother.
Do you like it bad?
Do you want to stay longer?
"Have you ever milked a cow?"
Tom took his last place.
I'll take a drink of it.
He loves you, Tom.
I spoke an old English language.
He didn't tell the truth about where he was that day.
Tom is missing.
Hi there, beautiful.
There will be no school on October 20th.
You're lying to me?
You've been waiting a lot for him.
You're getting married.
You are a part of the problem.
Don't stop tossing!
Sam was on his way to the top of the hill.
He didn't answer because he didn't know what to say.
You're an idiot?
"I heard something.
- What's the matter with you?
There's a bit of a pic on his shoulder.
I'm very happy to meet you here.
Tell me about a Chopin.
Move in a little bit.
I hope he's strong.
Be careful of your worries.
Did you know him?
"You're embarrassed?
I bought a new computer.
There's somebody?
I don't know how to write a computer.
My favorite month is October.
I was in the mountains.
Stephen is dead.
"Would you excuse me, Tom?"
You're scared of them?
"Please tell me your real name."
I hope no one is following you.
There's somebody?
I hope no one will follow you.
Mary was with him.
Let's go and tell the others.
That's the wine?
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
There was nothing wrong with what I did.
"Have you seen him yet?"
It's going to be small.
Go back to the race.
You've got a good book.
He knew I wasn't afraid of anyone.
She's reading it.
"Did anyone call you?
I didn't think it was counted.
He took her home.
I hate all of them.
Tom and Mary met at the station.
You've probably lost them all.
"Can I trust you?
Get in!
I want you to go to your room and take care of your needs.
Let's get something.
Don't Please
Don't stop to worry.
"You are our prisoner.
They talked about it.
Welcome to the Home.
You're already here.
"Are you going to work tonight?"
"Stay with me for something.
"Please let me pay for it.
Tom refused to give any details.
I know you're a fan.
He's been in Boston since last year.
It's going to be 30 in October.
Jim is like his father.
"I need you here.
I think there was someone in the room.
Are you scared?
You've become a fool?
I'm going to tell Mary.
Do you write in French?
He didn't want to kill his wife anymore.
No one knows it.
Sniff!
Not one of them is very useful.
Life is still ahead of you.
They all ran away.
We drove around the country by car.
I am a Chinese.
"Did you say anything about his father?"
Tom turned his attention to Mary.
"Are you sick?
No one has ever seen you come here.
Tom was asleep for an hour.
We're all singing.
Sam was talking to his mother.
I'm going to let Tom kiss me.
Sami found a hole in the hole.
Wait for him.
He said he wanted to give it a try.
Tom is waiting for it.
Someone's been watching us.
I'd like to show you a few things that have been translated for correction.
You've started talking.
He didn't tell me he was married.
It's a secret.
Construction began in October.
I've got you something to eat.
Beat it!
I was surprised to see him there.
Please select it.
Listen to that!
They built it.
You mustn't forget that.
I can't see her.
Ack them.
He thought Mary might have had a crush on him.
He didn't seem to care about Mary.
Please tell me who's going to help us.
Tom had stopped reading.
You have to stay away from them.
Don't you think you're close to Tom?
Sometimes, you just have to listen to the sound of your own voice.
We had a party yesterday.
"Okay, give me your voice a little bit more.
"How deep is it?"
You're Welcome!
I was in his room.
You're all crazy.
I haven't been here since October.
Somebody's got their umbrella.
He didn't know how to talk to people.
They were all happy.
It went out in October.
Thank you for your listening.
Can you make this one?
"Please don't worry, the doors are going to close!"
Someone should be able to stop you.
Don't be embarrassed when you're on fire.
He's only got a hamster.
Tom is very poor.
They don't laugh when their teeth are broken.
You Smell.
The registration deadline is October 20th.
"You're swimming better than me."
He said he could speak French.
I'll do the best I can for you.
It's good to swim with you.
I'm a Christian.
He didn't want Mary.
Wash off your clothes.
I'm so glad to see you here.
I was on the road last summer.
Why isn't anyone responding?
Let's eat something!
You've seen a movie, haven't you?
Maybe I should go now.
Tom threw Mary's sunshine out of the window.
"Can I speak to you alone?"
Who's ready to order?
I'd like to call my friend.
I'm very impressed Tom.
"We're starving here.
Sammy is crying like a baby.
Tom and I love each other.
"He who is my friend and is with me is against me."
We didn't ask him to help.
They're lying to your eyes.
Let me out of here!
How do you look like that?
Sam was reading better.
I've got the box.
She read to him.
Whoa, whoa!
You've got it!
Tom had three sets of clothes on Mary.
Don't eat if you don't want to.
He was angry with Mary.
Someone's been stealing my money.
I'll wait a little more.
Tom doesn't seem to be happy.
It's a new computer.
Say it exactly as you say.
The patients need to be treated by their patients.
He never asked me to.
you're asleep?
When are we going to do it?
We've got to get to Mary's as well.
Theblemt.
Is there anyone here?
"Can I go home now?"
She's a woman, she's not a girl.
Sam told me that you were in the office.
You'll be young.
I continued to work.
Ask them.
There's someone coming after us.
I came here in October of last year.
Will you come with me?
Tom wants to work.
Tom became Mary's friend when he lived in Boston.
But you don't have an idea.
He's too young for me.
I went to Boston in October of last year.
Let's talk about Tom!
"Please, please let me out.
It's not an apocalypse.
Somebody's been calling you.
"Hurry up!
That's the TRUTH.
I forgot all about you.
I love you very much.
"I know these people.
It's all good for you.
I want to come with you.
You've read this already?
Tom doesn't want to do that.
Tom and I were together.
You're not all right?
You've got this.
But I'm not your friend.
I hate the coffee.
She's teaching English.
Do you think someone can see me?
Leave it to us.
He sent me a word.
Let's see yourself!
It doesn't make any sense.
Ask for someone else.
I won't let you pay.
I need to be able to think for myself.
Walk slowly, though.
"Do you believe that?
You're eating these.
Someone's been looking at you.
He's an engineer.
Don't expect to be here on October 20th.
You're all crazy.
Is there anything you're worried about?
Tom ate a piece of bread.
Are you still crying?
I don't think that's true.
Get out of here!
Let's make a quest.
He left them on the train.
Moten.
He dances.
This is not yours, it's not yours.
They put up weapons.
Please be quiet, please.
Tom is an American.
The storms began to fall in October.
Read!
He was angry with Mary.
Go get dressed and change your clothes.
The mountain turned it into a hill.
Somebody's done that already.
Tom couldn't help it.
Good luck with your new job.
He hated the Algerians.
Go on home.
- What's the problem?
He's gone.
Is there anybody out there?
"Can you find it?
You can become a writer.
I've seen you in my dreams.
I'll try it.
You're not making any mistakes.
Reply them.
Tom seems to be very happy.
I've learned that from you!
I'm still in love with Tom.
Get up!
I don't know how to answer your question.
I didn't say anything to Mary.
He's rough.
"Think again.
There was power in the group.
Please, do as I said.
You are part of the problem.
Theblem?
Who's it?
You have a cup of coffee.
Can you see it?
"How long have you been reading?"
When did you go to Australia for the first time?
Tom is looking for Ken.
Tom nodded carefully.
"Would you excuse me, Tom?"
You stay at home.
of a question.
Tom smiled at her.
I remember.
She likes to watch the dance.
I've missed.
There's someone waiting for you.
"You're eating bread.
Rear-d.
My heart hurts.
No matter how tired you are, you're going to get the job done.
You've finished the fight.
He's only going to answer the questions.
"It's like you've heard a lot of people say, 'I've heard a lot of people say something like that.'
She's dead.
He built it.
Now, come on now.
"Did you read?
"Call me tomorrow.
It's snowing.
You'll be seeing Tom soon.
I'm sending this letter by air.
I think you'll agree with Tom.
There's someone coming.
It's expensive to.
Everyone's happy.
The first language of the country is its language.
Let go of me!
Just look at my new car.
READ to us.
Where did you find it?
He was sitting under a tree.
You can use your computer if you want to.
Do not play.
Take a look at Tom.
No one understands.
Please help me in my work.
You don't have to stay here.
Kathleen likes his language.
I do not have a solution.
WHERE are you?
Tom has a new one.
You have to pay for Tom's money.
They've all been fired.
She swims very well.
She likes to read.
Tom seems to be scared.
I'm going to tell you that.
He has given us everything we want.
I hate Mary.
What do you do when it rains?
He hates to ask his students when they want to talk to him.
You've just seen my new car.
Happy Birthday to you!
No one knows it.
Tom does it all on his own.
It's going to be pretty easy.
Are you coming back from Thailand?
Go with your feet.
Stop and don't panic.
You've had dinner, haven't you?
Don't watch it.
Tom seems to be very happy.
She loves you very much.
They're very beautiful writing.
We look forward to seeing many of you.
I met him in October.
Are you an alcoholic?
You're going to get married!
"You were at home?
I've only met her once.
Please, please, please, please, please, please.
Did you hear what they said?
Kathleen's house is beautiful.
She was in love with Mary in high school.
Is there anyone in there?
Just let me in.
They're eating millions of dollars worth of food.
Don't be shy!
Why do you think she and Mary are together?
Save it.
I'd like to kiss you.
Tom and Mary were gone.
Have you seen the new movie?
I've found your card.
The beauty of it made him.
I'm playing Chopin.
You seem to have found yourself.
He was born an American.
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
I'll call you tomorrow night.
You should try to get to know him.
I know he's an idiot.
I need a couple of eggs.
I'm told he's still in Australia.
I'm going to a Chinese restaurant tonight.
Tom speaks in French.
He's not talking to me.
Now that I'm a teacher, I feel the same way.
Mary likes to dress up.
I don't know who killed him.
Sam was 6 years old.
Don't stop learning!
You have to tell Tom the truth.
Today, someone was killed by Tom.
I want you to come back today.
Get out of here!
Take it to him!
Is there anyone who's written my name?
It looks like you're from Europe.
Someone had come to our house.
I want you to tell me the truth.
No, thank you. I'm gone.
Let me explain it to you.
Here's the boy.
You're stupid!
He's trying to steal the kids.
Ask one of them to see you first.
When's the last time you've cried?
Somebody's been calling.
He wanted to go back to his room, and he went back to his room and picked up some of the pieces.
Keep this up.
My wife thought I was a fool.
He just didn't speak, he didn't speak.
I'm really looking forward to being at your Halloween party.
Let's hear me!
I know it's a long one.
I've been hit.
Please, please, again.
I don't know what you like.
French is not only spoken in France.
Stay tuned so that you don't run.
"Take this table.
You're happy.
"Go and feel good.
You're new here, aren't you?
It's a small dog.
What kind of food do you eat?
"Somebody can stop me.
Close your eyes and you'll think very carefully.
Look at it again.
He or someone else said that.
Take a break.
I think he's ready for Tom.
Oh, my God!
I didn't know you had a brother.
Speak up!
Sired!
No one can do it for Tom.
<0xE1><0xB9><0xA2>ubb!
"Where does Tom live?"
Let go of me!
Have you read the book yet?
Mary was almost killed by a gun.
We're on the top of the hill.
You're not tired, are you?
He won the Nobel Prize in Physics.
He didn't help Mary.
That's French?
Open up the door.
I didn't read it well.
He didn't want to get married.
Do know.
Dead?
"You're our prisoner.
The paper is good for you.
You've seen him do that, haven't you?
Tom didn't get his head.
My parents couldn't speak French.
There's no hiding.
Today is the 20th of October.
My younger brother was inspired by my grandmother.
I agree.
"You're really stupid!
I'll eat it if you eat it too.
Please don't cry.
He's worth it.
That's the truth, is it?
He was forced to leave his job.
"Someone's just called.
He was dressed like a girl on Halloween.
I saw him at his house last night.
What's your plan?
Am I in on this?
I've won this.
Where do you currently live?
Sam seemed to be out of his mind.
Welcome to the Home.
I can't wait to write with you.
The TRUTH is greater than everything.
Your life is different from mine.
Somebody's been following me.
We picked up the pieces and went straight to the market.
Do you're doing it?
Tom was in front of Mary.
Sam went back to work.
You don't run.
Are you at home, too?
You say you live in the lake.
Tom came by himself, not Mary.
You keep writing.
Try to find the cure.
You'd better cut off your hair.
"Yes, please.
I'm not ready to swim.
Shut up, you're up.
Is it true that Jesus is the Son of God?
"Tell me something.
"When did you come to Boston?"
We're just going to talk in French.
He felt like he knew Laila.
I just got out of the caf<0xC3><0xA9>.
This is the kind of food I like.
I just hope no one sees you here.
That's free?
You've pissed me off.
All of our food is cooked.
Do good to those who hate you.
No matter how fast you want to get there, you won't get there on time.
Show me where he lives.
In order to learn the language, you need to learn the language.
They all died.
I hate to work.
Be on your own.
Do you know how far Boston is from Chicago?
As soon as I wanted to grow up, the Son began to take care of me.
Can you get that?
He hasn't been here in the last week.
Where's your uncle?
I don't believe what they told us.
No one was laughing.
Let them help you.
I heard him open the door.
You're mad?
You're sad?
There was someone outside there.
Sami and Laila are trying to get rid of all of the tyranny of the tyranny.
They want something to write.
We've written these books.
It's your parents?
Make another cookie.
Tom is a good man.
What do we have to say?
How many tickets did you get?
The French language is difficult.
He's very fast.
I think he's waiting for me.
Keyfent.
The people are very happy in Australia.
Oh, how strong you are!
He likes to do things.
You are a problem.
You're a guest here.
I'm always proud of you.
I think you've been deceived.
Hello! how are you?
Tom used to cry a lot.
He said he's never been a fan of Abby.
Don't you swear now?

Reinforced!
You should always have a dictionary in your hands.
It's your clothes!
I hope you will understand.
We left early on.
"You're our prisoners.
He had a lot more money to pay for what he wanted.
Tom agreed to it.
Tom is very upset.
Come on in!
Sam's car was very good.
Let's get you singing.
My love is living.
Close your Eyes.
Is there anyone you'd like to see?
How can I explain it to you?
He left on October 20th.
You're full?
How much?
I want someone to talk to.
I don't want to watch TV anymore.
Mary and Tom are helping out.
Sam had a knife in his hand.
I know you have to have the courage to do that.
Tom and Mary got married in October 2013.
Stay with me for a while.
Go out and boil some cold water.
October 20, 2013 is the year.
Tom's got it.
Check them out.
Looks like you're from Lulu.
It reminds me of Italy.
It is the 3rd of October.
He's drunk.
The snow is white, the snow is black.
It doesn't matter who you are.
It's disgusting for your writing.
I'm very busy.
Somebody's been stealing it from me.
I'll wake you up in the morning.
Who is the best football player in the world?
You don't have the truth.
in your power.
You're probably eating a lot.
It's a fool's errand for people.
Do you know anyone who speaks French in your country?
"Are you going to read today?"
It's our turn!
We eat meat.
I've been drinking more than twice.
I want to see who's calling.
"Do you want something else?
Just talk to them.
You can get milk from the cows.
Get out of the problem!
Let's just leave them alone.
You've failed.
My life is in your hands.
I feel for one.
I hope no one sees you like that.
The results!
I'll always remember Mary.
He doesn't know Mary.
Tom was on foot.
You still don't like it, do you?
What do you know about what happened?
I'm going to wash my clothes.
I've been given a ticket.
I really don't like chicken.
His father had never been to another country.
How many books have you read?
You're talking like your mother.
But I know about Tom.
"You're a thief?
It doesn't matter.
It's best to start right away.
What's the best place in Boston?
I've learned.
When are you going to eat?
I listen to the music.
"I'll call you tonight.
Somebody's been stealing time.
I'm glad I didn't see it.
A man came to visit him at his house last night.
Tom didn't pick up his head.
I'm not quite finished today.
"Do you like Tom's wife?"
Tom said he didn't want Mary to succeed.
I've tried to get Tom to do that.
away from the fire.
Everything is going to change.
He fought Mary in front of everyone.
Get another one.
If you need me, call me.
They won't help.
Don't let me cut my head off.
Can you do this?
I'm praying Tom.
Please tell me where he lives.
I think he's finished.
And he laid hold of him, and fled.
We got married on October 20th.
I'm sure they're wrong.
I'd like to eat sweet potatoes.
I don't know where Mary lives.
Do you like the science fiction films?
And they speak French.
You'd better tell the truth.
Shut up the window!
They're eating these.
Tom knew it very well.
Error!
You're kidding me like that?
He doesn't know what the future holds.
Somebody's got to do that.
He gave the teacher an apple.
You're asleep?
Tom seems to be very strong.
I'm so glad he got caught.
Did you learn to cook or anything else?
The full use of wood.
I wonder where they are.
I understand it.
I wish I could have done something like this.
Tom doesn't live in London.
You were at home.
Hurry up, or you'll get off the train.
I met a man who knew him.
Take a closer look.
I like the pop music.
No one said that.
They all smiled.
"This guy was a cat.
Do you want to go to school by train?
"Why do people lie?"
I'm going to buy the same car as my grandfather.
Do you think we will succeed?
Check it out again.
There's no one inside.
I wish him a good night.
Tom is staying here.
I think his opinion is a good one.
Just take a look at my new car.
Don't stop craving!
This thread has been captured.
The water, please.
This will make you stronger.
Sammy is quick to respond on Facebook.
Somebody's broken the wall.
I don't read the music.
I don't know where he is.
I've been raining.
I know.
What kind of paper do you want?
She's worried.
Do you work in Australia?
Commit.
I can't write that well.
Your father's got a lot.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
For example, the phrase "the Muslims love Jesus and Moses, or the devil" is clearly a cross between the gulf and the gulf between these and the gulfs, and the gulf between the gulf and the gulf, and the gulf between the vultures and the vultures.
Where's your grandma?
My sister is a very beautiful girl.
"You're Anna?
"Please, find it.
You'll wait until Tom arrives.
"Did you see your table?"
You're a Hungarian?
"Look at that kid, he's going to be quiet.
My food is here.
She's been in a bad mood.
Just send me one of them.
Someone is waiting for you.
Tom's going to run.
He came to visit Mary.
Who'd they talk to?
I didn't have any money in my pocket.
The animals were terrified of them.
Tom is very nice.
You've been blinded by love.
Everybody knows it.
Please, please, please, help me open the door.
Can you give me a copy?
Put your hand on me.
You've been waiting for a lot.
I don't think I should have asked that question.
Don't stop the arduino.
Bninet.
Are you waiting for someone?
The girl is familiar.
"Stop the fight.
Come in!
"Quickly.
This happened on October 20th.
"How old are you?
You are a great writer.
I love my brothers and sisters, too.
Do not use this train in front of the water.
I hope it will always be like this.
It's really hard to figure out what that is.
"Stay with us.
Tom had left them.
I hope it will always be like this.
Keep your feet out of here.
I want you to read this letter.
Thelkem.
Tom nodded.
You've heard it, haven't you?
You're dead.
I know you're a student.
We bought a bottle of water.
In your class.
He's got to do something.
Leave it all.
I can teach you how to read.
He is one of my father's disciples.
I'm very Hungry.
You have to apologise.
Sam had a bad day.

Do you think you're all right?
"Did you hear me?
Nfares.
He's going to fix everything.
We forgot him.
I'm going to Tom's tomorrow.
Mary gave birth to a Halloween dress for her children.
How long do you have to stay in Boston?
Why do you think non-Muslims should be allowed to die?
You are the love of my life.
I hate him, too.
He sat next to his daughter.
Take all of it.
You know, the names I have given to those who are in the city of Jezreel.
They're all waiting.
I don't want to live with you.
It seemed as if he had turned to me.
"Please give us two cups of coffee."
I was sent a word.
"Don't you think you speak French better than me?"
"Kiss knows how to work.
Let him do it.
He likes to read.
I told him where I wanted to go.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to succeed.
He was looking for Mary.
They've gone.
She writes poems.
Don't stop crying!
I think about it day and night.
You've done a lot of dancing. I wish you were there.
Take it easy on yourself.
You're a muslim.
"Where's your uncle?
You couldn't get the ball off.
It's hard to be alone in French.
I'm pretty sure we'll do that.
Give me a watch.
I love the trains.
"I told him he wasn't here.
I hate all of them.
There is no one in this room.
It's very nice of him.
I bought a piece of pizza.
Tom and Mary told me, "You don't have to do that yourself."
He's been listening to his parents.
I don't know how to read.
"Can you swim?"
I didn't use my right eye.
Give it to everyone.
I HATE the job.
I want someone to help me do that.
Gzant.

Well, I have a guitar.
We'll meet again in October.

Please stop, please.
Why don't you go to school?
How do you make them laugh?

"I haven't seen Tom.
Now, go and change your clothes.
They all Laughed.
I sing the music.
They're not bad.
As soon as she came, she came.
Please take a look at the future.
Well, come here.
It's so lucky!
Read.
I didn't know that.
I really like Mary.
You're worried.
He's done it so many times.
Get away from me.
There was someone there.
I love to tell stories to children.
They went to Boston.
"Please get up.
Get rid of the problem!
Someone should be able to stop you.
This book is important for a number of reasons.
That's all that?
Maybe we'll see later.
Give me the ribbons.
Do this!.
Take it to him!
Aren't you happy?
Are you going to let us go now?
Let him go.
I really really love you.
Are you sick?

It's been raining for two days.
"No, I don't know your brother.
I can't remember your name.
The day will come.
I like to swim.
Tom's swimming.
Just leave him alone.
If it wasn't so expensive, I'd buy it.
He didn't know Mary.
What makes you feel bad about me, too.
Who's got these books?
"Why do you want a car?"
You're not fooling me!
I hope no one will see you.
I'm Hungry
Three days later, Tom died.
Give it to whoever you want.
You're on your own?
Do you want to open it now?
"Get us out of here," he said, "and get out of here."
No one understands me.
"Get your clothes on!
Have a little tea.
"What do the birds eat?
Cut them all out.
I'm driving to the beach.
I'm going to miss Tom.
You're such a fool!
I'm too old for that.
We'll be with you tomorrow.
He's afraid of the horse.
We shared.
Now you're on your own!
"Shut up!
She likes to go out with her friends.
You don't have to stay here.
The world is a crying river.
What kind of French language do I have to buy?
Are you ready for it later?
He's checking them?
"Did you kill Tom?"
He will then give his opinion on whether it is a summary of the book or a subsequent issue.
Can I ask you a question if you don't mind?
You're here?
I'm not here to do you any harm.
Who'd you give the book to?
Go and see if anyone can help you.
It started to snow.
Tom knows what you're thinking.
"Please hurry up!
Is it time to leave?
I was married to you.
"I know that voice.
I'll trust you.
Let's hope it doesn't happen again.
In fact, I hate chicken.
Something's happened.
No one has ever seen you.
"No, I don't know your brother.
She's going to cry when she's gone.
Let's hope for the best.
The truth is screaming.
Can you get to 9?
He's going to clean up the mess.
Your life is different from mine.
Tom went to Mary's in Boston in October.
"You're in the blood," he said.
Where do you live like that?
I can't take care of you.
Cease to cry.
You deserve.
You're all on your own.
I really wanted to love Tom.
I can't do that if you don't help me.
That's too much for Tom.
I know what it's all about...until they ask me.
It's Tom who's calling you.
I won't try to stop you.
Who's got it?
Why aren't you doing anything?
Hiding?
There are a lot of places in Rome.
Take it with you.
Somebody's going to pay.
I invited them to the party.
Don't do what Tom wants.
Get started!
It could be tomorrow.
He's right about Mary.
You're out.
You've done a lot of dancing. I wish you were there.
Are You Tired?
I love the music of rock.
Mary liked it, too.
"I need these letters.
Is there anyone who can help me?
But you're in Boston.
Do you want to go to a party?
You're lying.
Don't stop the booze.
He met the cyclists at the time.
Have you read this book?
He could be swimming.
I hate Halloween, too.
Who told you that you can't swim?
So, what's new?
We're listening to music.
Do the same as him.
My wife thinks I'm crazy.
Tom and Mary are the same way.
We agree.
Kathmandu is able to learn all the languages of the world.
"Have you ever eaten a cow?"
Tom had died yesterday.
Well, I'm a Thai.
Tom is very old and very gentle.
He doesn't know how to use a computer.
I got into a fight.
Tom nodded his head.
He wanted to ask Mary.
I want everyone to be happy.
You're idiots.
She wants to leave now.
I don't think they believe us.
"Your parents love me very much.
You're angry?
I'll call you again later.
She said she was terrified of Mary.
In order to learn the language, you need to learn the language.
We need someone to help him.
"Stay outside.
Sometimes things don't work out the way you think they do.
There's no one here.
They are from Asia.
Don't stop here.
They want to learn English.
Hello, my sweetie.
Fennan
Sit down!
"You'll have my car.
It's an island of poets, artists, and legends.
Smuggled.
I just believe it.
He found a chicken and woke up.
He said he wanted to learn French.
She's going to sleep with him.
You'd better cut off your hair.
But he didn't see Tom.
The work is free.
What did you say to him?
He was married to Mary.
I couldn't speak French when I got there.
I hate the Algerians.
"I hate football.
Do you have a home in Australia?
Go back home early.
He seems to know Mary.
Call to us.
"I love Tom.
Come in.
Where'd you find this key?
I don't know where Mary is.
My wife thought I was ready.
Somebody's eating.
Is there anyone who's come?
Speak up quickly.
Mr. Jones has come to see you.
Do we really need to go back?
Get out of here!
Don't let them down.
You know the law.
I'm continuing to sing.
"Break your hands with blood.
The snow was beginning to rain.
Shut up already.
I've never seen Tom.
Do you speak like an Italian?
Tom is able to succeed.
"Did you see a lot of them?
I'm running at 7.
I can't go to Australia this year.
You're young?
"Are you going to work tonight?"
He turned to the other side.
The so-called "British" language no one can find in it.
She wanted to see Layla.
Sit down at the table.
Look at the back!
I don't want to go back to Boston.
Well, we don't know.
I'm almost out.
Don't you think about it, too?
But nothing's going to change.
Do you like the literature?
Who's going to use Tatoeba in your life?
Just go slowly, though.
Oh, how I missed you!
Maybe I'll forget the keys.
I didn't think he needed our help.
Tom did a great job.
I wish him a good night.
He likes to drink wine.
Somebody's been calling you.
Combine.
Now that I've done half the work, I need to rest.
You're the one I wanted to talk to.
"Do you like my friend?"
"Why did you go there?
Is there anyone who can help?
She couldn't listen to Mary.
The Bible is.
He's lovingly working on his own.
It's been a long time since he's been working on a computer.
- What are you doing?
Somebody's been calling.
I'll take my advice to people.
"I don't know the rules," he said.
I think there was someone in the room.
I hope that something bad doesn't happen.
Apparent.
So you've said!
We wait.
I remember watching this movie.
You said you were going to get it.
There's a wind.
I will live in the city.
I'll never forget the day I met you.
I wasn't a good high school student.
Tom is pissed.
I left the house before I got home.
You just have to stay here.
Try to get to know him.
Did you give him a gift for his birthday?
Tom and Mary came to Boston with me.
"Stay with us.
You're not going to help.
Tom is always very good.
I'm not building it.
"Do you live here?
I hope no one saw you.
I love you very much.
Are you the one who took this picture?
I want someone to talk to.
"Please, take me to my seat.
I've been running.
He didn't believe the story was true.
Have you ever read this book?
"Please respond to me in French.
I'm not worried about you, I'm just sorry.
He hasn't written to me since October.
Yuba is the king of the Berbers.
Aki-d!
I'm looking for Tom.
READ THIS!
You're an idiot!
Am I Wrong?
I wasn't the only one who was upset.
That's good.
Is there anyone who has written my name?
He likes to read.
When you're done with your work, you'll be back.
I want to be a movie star.
I know you're a millionaire.
Tom is a good speaker.
Sam was sitting in a chair.
She kissed Mary.
Take it! Take it!
That's not a good man!
I'm still cold.
"Where did you cook them?"
The car was wrecked.
My husband bought a new car.
Sammy was wearing my shoes.
Give it to whomever you want.
I slid down from the right eye.
Russia is home to many famous men such as Lenin, Stalin, Malenkov, Kru<0xC4><0x8D>ev, Brejnev, Andropov, Czernik, Gurba<0xC4><0x8D>ev, Elsin, Medvedev, Putin.
But I don't know the truth.
No one has ever seen you.
They're caliphs.
Take some examples.
Well, somebody knows.
I like to eat Russian food.
I saw it in the school.
Are you going to go?
I don't want to buy them a drink.
Agreed.
He didn't write or send anything.
Inu uvilu-a.
You've tried.
You are very different from us.
He saved me, Bob.
"You have a little sister?"
Can you give me the card, please?
I'm still living with Tom.
Is there anything I can do to help them?
Who's survived?
So, what's up today?
If you're in Rome, live like the Romans.
"Call me again.
He's alone in the woods.
Don't stop tossing!
This place is very dry.
I hear someone talking to me.
We're back from Australia.
Don't be afraid, I'm here.
I sent this message to you.
Trying to keep up with Tom.
You've been there?
We didn't do it!
I was a manager for 3 years.
I hope for a year of peace and prosperity.
I'm tired of your complaints.
You're talking too fast.
A little bit, please.
You're giving me rest!
"Hurry up!
What I've won?
Stop it's.
We were driving slowly.
Do you write in French?
I've struggled a lot.
Mr. West called when he wasn't there.
You have to come with me.
stop there.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Tom and Mary were together on the road.
Sami is now in jail and is in jail.
Somebody's been talking about Tom.
I'm using aspirin.
Mary is sick.
It's snowing, and it's black.
So, what?
I'm sorry for your success.
Did you check it?
Call him.
I did that, too.
Elaine is very beautiful.
Is there anything that's changed?
She cleaned up the bag.
They've made.
It's been late.
Tom is a very good singer.
"You're dead?
Tom will be here until October 20th.
I'm getting married in October.
I like the reading.
They all danced.
I can get you something to eat.
You don't have to be afraid that way.
You're not going to wait!
How'd you spend your time in Boston?
I forgot all about you.
We're being bullied.
Unfurnished!
I want someone to help me do this.
Put your boot on. It's cold outside.
Enter it, Tom.
I'm drinking milk.
You are part of the problem.
Let go of me!
She's always changing her mind.
But I can't write.
I know it's Tom's story.
You've closed your eyes.
He is working a lot of hard.
Open up your eyes!
It's my destiny.
Like a cloud, I'm flying over the top of my home.
Tom came with me to London.
When I closed all the doors, I went to sleep.
He's the only one who'll come.
Let's drive in a hurry.
I'm using Firefox.
I've been bad.
You're young?
He said he was happy with the results.
Do as I told you.
Why don't you want to see it?
He's been talking about politics and his friends all night.
Tom is very smart.
It rained during the night.
"Please come in.
You're not going to eat here.
"He gave me his key.
Keep on reading.
Read this book with the help of your voice.
He had a good reason to learn to speak French.
You're new to me?
Are you going to do that to me?
When he was a young man, he died.
He didn't tell me he was married.
I need to buy something to eat.
Pass the teas.
Somebody's been singing.
He said he wanted to sleep.
"Help!
WHY?
You can change it if you want to.
Tom started to get angry with me.
You've read this?
Hey to yourself!
Do you have time to eat before the wedding?
He lives with his family in Los Angeles.
Go on your own.
They've caught him.
Have you reached your goal?
I just wanted to talk to Tom.
Is there anyone who's sleeping?
Take this!
We are at home.
The one who didn't eat it was the one who ate it.
Don't have the courage!
Welcome to canada.
We agree.
He called me when you weren't there.
I want someone to talk to.
You may say it!
Sell it.
Do you want to go to Boston tomorrow?
You've broken the door.
I didn't get you into this problem.
"Sing, please!
I've known Mary since she was a child.
I don't agree with your mistakes.
You're eating sweets?
Six a Tom.
We pray for you.
I haven't had dinner yet.
They were all clapping.
You've got a lot of friends.
Is there anyone who has come?
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
You'll be able to swim a lot.
Oh, you're a jerk!
He said he had to get some money.
Please tell me who's going to help us.
There was someone outside.
Tom didn't have any success.
I don't have this problem.
I think there's something in the room.
You thought you were saying that.
They all helped.
You're mad?
If you want to wash it, be careful.
You're too tall!
Tom denied it.
That's a cat?
She knows how to speak Japanese.
When do I want to go to Boston?
Come back at once.
Where'd you go?
He turned to Mary.
We've been hit.
He never asked me to.
Sam started to do that.
I think it's all right with Tom.
There's just something that's just happened.
Let's go down below.
Tom has become a hero.
She'll do it.
Sammy likes to do that.
The woman was reading.
Is there anyone at home?
Tom is very high.
Kathmandu is like any other language.
No one has ever seen you do that.
You are a problem.
"Why can't we eat here?"
He killed a man with a knife.
Are you a U.S. citizen?
There's somebody there.
That's what someone or someone else said.
They're all waiting.
It's a good one, isn't it?
This guy is eating almost everything.
I didn't want to get up!
Put out the window!.
Why don't you take it to our table?
Did you read it all?
That's an arcade!
I can teach you how to read it.
You are a part of the problem.
I'm going to get some flowers.
I don't want to go to school tonight.
Get your asses off!
You can eat whenever you want to.
There's someone watching.
It didn't translate correctly.
"Who invited you to the party?"
So, what are you talking about?
I didn't find it.
I think he's afraid of Tom.
"You're married?
Thank you for telling us that.
Who's dead?
Sam was talking a lot.
You're drinking fresh water.
I'm going to stop.
"Try this.
It's your pics?
He speaks japanese.
I haven't changed. You have changed.
But it's still hot.
Tom and Mary will always be together.
I want someone to help me do this.
Take this.
She's reading.
I understand!
I love the pictures I've got here.
I've got a good idea.
You've closed the door.
I like to laugh very much.
Mary Abbott was killed.
If you want to eat it, you can.
It's a breeze of the night.
"Do you have a brother, Anna?"
"We were afraid that he didn't have any friends in Boston, but he did find himself.
For you?
He lied about where he was at that time.
Tom is very upset.
Find the cat, though.
"Did you drink tea?
It's true?
Let's get you running.
What can you do for someone else?
It's not easy because it requires a lot of money.
You've got my mind!
Tom doesn't have a plan.
When I'm done, I'll come back.
Ask them.

He wasn't with Mary.
Well, who knows?
Well, something happened.
A red wine, please.
It's over learning.
What's happened to your phone?
"Can you stop the fight?
He drove his car to the back of the car.
In peace.
Take a look at this.
Someone's been talking about Tom.
He's three hours older than me.
Sam didn't stay away from me.
The birds eat the birds.
That's what Tom does.
I read it to Mary.
Tom was working on an airplane.
I told him you'd know.
Eating!
He nodded in red.
Do you like the science fiction films?
Have you ever been to Kyoto?
You understand it, don't you?
Have you seen this film?
I'll be watching you and I'll be watching you until you're dead and I'm not going to let you down.
I can't stay.
So you're new?
I was on a mountain.
Why doesn't anyone believe in me?
Please tell me who I'm going to take.
It can't.
You are a Doctor.
I'm going to be 30 in October.
You can come back every day.
I'm going to call him Tony.
It's not good.
It's hard to believe that you should do anything to your parents.
Sam was gone.
Are you waiting for someone?
He's moving fast.
Do you think I'm pretty?
I know I've come.
When do you want to eat?
I love you very much.
I'm a little behind me.
Where's your God now?
"Show me your papers!"
He doesn't know what's going on there.
I'm ready
"I think I can trust you.
Take care of yourself.
It's been sold for a lot of time.
Please, please, forget about this issue.
Go and find someone who can help you.
I don't think I would do that.
Give to us.
You have spoken very carefully.
Please call him on the phone.
Do you really want to eat all that?
Would you mind if you continue to work in this kind of place?
Please, please, please be calm.
What's that?
Kathleen is your light.
I don't think he did it.
My older sister is going to see you.
They all know it.
What happened to what we asked for?
I love you as you are.
Hold on to it.
There's someone watching Tom.
Fuck-it!
Succeeded!
"I think I can trust you.
I want to eat now.
If I did, I'd tell you.
See you, Sayoko.
Are you sure you've seen the same person?
Do the best you can.
I have nothing to say.
They're waiting for you.
I've stopped smoking.
Champagne, please.
Who's that?
She's laughing.
Ravens is the name of the city, but it's actually the name of the city.
Is there anything you want?
I only know English and French.
The sale of beers is done.
He was trying to do it when he tried to do it.
Everybody's changing.
I know what he's doing.
Jbed!
I'm pissed here.
Let me pay for it.
That's the car.
"Can I go home now?"
When are we going to do it?
I think he saw it.
I know someone who's been talking to me.
Can't talk about it in the morning?
Look at it.
"I'm sorry, Tom.
I'm not finished writing a book.
God will bless you.
I was born to love you.
Be kind to you.
Come early on.
I know you.
I'm tired of dying.
She didn't want to see him.
I'm speaking your language.
I've followed her.

He speaks a lot of languages.
No one hates you.
What's the time in Boston?
"Give me the book.
I've seen a jump.
I know Tom.
Understanding.
You've found him!
Tom's performance was a delight to him.
There's just someone who just called.
Mary ran away.
He can't cook.
Tom seemed to be a little girl.
I hope you'll be back in Boston soon.
You are John.
When you have the time to read this book.
The women will come first.
I don't think he would have seen that.
Do you have any friends who don't eat?
It is October 20th.
I like the reading.
You're worried.
Ddremt!
I want someone to help me do this.
You're well-known?
Mary was a widow, and she could have been a rich man.
You're wrong.
Do you think you're going to have a time?
What kind of book do you write?
It's very build up!
Can we see you again when?
He went out to help Mary.
Have you ever played with your partner?
Please don't cry.
He gave it to Mary.
Have you ever written an article on wikipedia?
"Are you going to eat or come with us?"
We believe you.
Tom is working at home.
They cut off my hands.
"Why did you call Tom?"
You've read this?
We returned to Australia on October 20th.
She really likes Laila.
"Why did you just come here?
The tree is a fish.
"Are you going to have dinner at home today?"
Sami learned Arabic in Cairo.
Be of the courage!
They want to get rich.
There's someone calling you.
Don't let anyone go to the fire.
Have you ever read "Moby Dick?"
"Who are you calling, please?"
Don't give up others.
Afraid of you?
Have you read this book yet?
That's why he didn't do that.
"You're a foreigner?
He said he wanted to do it, but he didn't.
I've lost my words.
He's so young that he's got to work for us.
"When did you get back from Boston?"
Mary was hiding.
They tried to get me married.
That's true.
You're a German?
I know you've lied to me.
You're wrong.
It's going to be Tom.
You can talk for an hour at a time.
Are you asleep?
Is it from Russia, or is it from Russia?
Put a good word in front of you.
I can see why he did it.
Why isn't anyone helping you?
I respect you.
He arrived in Boston at the end of October.
Do you want to speak French?
There's someone waiting for you.
He turned his back on the back of his head.
I'm sorry I can't learn all the languages of the world.
Football is a crazy game.
"Please don't leave me.
Stop the fight with you.
That's not possible!
I told him I'd wait for him.
It's a language that doesn't eat anything.
"He can't wait here alone.
You don't have to be afraid that way.
He saw a light from a distance and was happy.
Tom's contract expires on October 20th.
Tom is fat.
Eat with a spoonful.
I'll do everything I can to make sure you don't lose weight.
"When did you leave?
That's a good question.
"Do you want to be a writer?" he asked.
I do that every day.
We've got to do something.
Well, I'm Irish.
Sami came home for lunch.
You're very drunk!
How did we get to this situation?
It's been a while since I've been told that it's not easy, but it's never been easy.
Please, please.
He's never talked about you.
I really like to play golf.
He's going to be 30 in October.
"Why do people lie?"
I didn't know he had any friends.
You're idiots!
He loves the people who beat him up.
You're new?
What's been stolen?
Keep your eyes up.
Good?
He wants someone to look at him.
It doesn't help your dictionary.
It's very good Tom.
Maybe there's something you know.
If you want a good place, there's nothing like an early start.
No one answered.
He wants to buy some books.
Them?
Do you have a little sister?
You're going to have a little sister.
I've had three fish this morning.
Tom's room is always nice.
he's working.
Are You Afraid of Movies?
He was busy day and night.
I know you're a stranger.
But it's not October yet.
I was told not to buy an old car.
He's going to eat later.
You've got to be careful.
What time do you have to come home?
It smells like a dog.
I thought there was a problem to be solved.
Give it to whoever you want.
It's a good one, isn't it?
- How are you?
We've got to do something.
It's an English.
"You're our prisoner.
It's raining.
You can't sleep without the light.
You have to go home.
I need to talk to somebody.
Don't stop now!
Don't talk to me.
in their power.
Please let me know if there's any change.
Please take a step forward.
I think the same thing about Tom and me.
What do they want from them?
He is Mary's husband.
He said he'd leave the door open.
you're there?
You'll find her car in her room.
I was told not to do that.
Tom is a good teacher.
I'm going to let Mary do that.
I haven't seen you since Halloween.
People are afraid of war.
They want to come back.
I love you very much.
you're talking?
He did it on October 20th.
I don't have a very good dictionary.
The trees are killing plants.
The guards are dead.
Tell them.
"Help yourself.
He's always yelling at me.
There's something about Tom.
Kiss those who love.
I'd like to pay you, please.
I don't think like you.
I heard the door open.
She was so angry that she didn't want to leave her mother.
In the 1980s, people from Poland came to Kabyle to study the animals.
Tom is angry.
"Please, please, please.
"Did you try the chicken?"
Somebody's been watching you.
The girl looks just like her mother.
He returned in October of last year.
We've been doing a lot of this stuff.
To be honest, I'm not a man or a woman.
I'd like to try something else.
Have you read it all?
Please, please don't die.
There's someone who knows.
You're reading your country.
There's something I'm going to tell you about Mary.
Look as hard as you can. I'll show you how to do it.
I've been going to Boston since October.
Tom was out of his mind.
I'll show you what to eat.
This test is available for us.
I'm looking for Tom.
There's no doubt!
He tried to kill Mary with a knife.
"He wanted to do it, he said.
Do you think I should do that?
Tom died in Boston when he was 30 years old.
You've got these.
Tom was elected.
Tom seems to be a little bit.
My dog has a very long necklace.
I think he was a bit drunk when I saw him last night.
I went out with a French-speaking girl in high school.
You are the United States.
Tom's head was turned upside down.
Whoa, you know.
You are the mother of my heart.
Let the animals out of their prisons.
I'm going to buy it.
You'll end up apologizing.
I know you don't want to doubt anything.
You've fooled me!
He went to Boston.
Someone's been watching us.
He didn't want it, he didn't want it.
He didn't know I was hungry.
He will be in third place on October 20th.
I love the cherry.
I don't think about that.
Welcome to the Home.
You're a CHICK.
"Who invited you to the party?"
"Where'd you forget your umbrella?"
What do you think of your new book?
What a beautiful young man!
I don't think I should speak like a mother, but I just want to be able to talk.
Yes, sin.
You have to read this.
God doesn't see me that way.
I'm walking in the dark.
I can teach you how to sing.
My father used to travel.
I hate Mary.
I'm not your servant!
How do you think you're eating all that?
You've gone crazy?
Thank you for listening to them.
I'm just looking for my new car.
Where's I am?
They're innocent.
What kind of paper do you want?
That's where you're wrong.
It's been three months since October.
I hope it will always be like this.
Get more.
Tom was starting to get heavy.
"Stay at something.
You must be all wrong.
Many houses have been burned down.
Why didn't they say anything?
Tom was with someone else.
I'm afraid we won't get there soon.
My father's grandfather is my mother's grandfather.
No one knows it.
You are ALWAYS together.
There's nothing there.
Keep on running!
I hope you've learned from some of your mistakes.
You need to write a novel.
Somebody's been calling you.
I prefer to work at night.
This is Nina, your son's daughter.
You're playing sports?
You've got it.
Nothing will take your word.
"You're rich?
But don't forget about us!
You're done?
We're done.
Above all else, be kind and gentle.
"That's your slave, isn't it?"
I hate to lose.
Someone has to be the first to go.
Sami jumped into Laila's car.
I hope you will listen to me.
You're welcome.
Go to facebook.
I've bought it.
They don't need anything.
"Have something.
Tom nodded.
There's a bunch of dead bodies.
He never gave it to anyone else.
Everybody was talking.
He knows you're lying.
So, what else?
You talked to them, didn't you?
What am I going to say!
I'll take it in October.
You're drenched.
in your own power!
Tom doesn't know I'm here.
"It's not over yet," said Stacey.
All of you are crazy.
"You're praying.
It's all obvious!
I know you're right.
I'll call you before I leave.
I can't swim with you today.
She drinks a lot of water.
Close your book.
When someone's looking for you, don't worry about it.
"Why are you crying?
She's reading.
Mary likes him, too.
He usually wakes up early.
He's grown his hair.
You've looked at her.
Tom was trying to kill Mary.
You know the way.
What's wrong with going to Boston?
Write in Spanish.
You have to ask someone else.
He wasn't an idiot.
Because it's so hard, I can't help it.
Please, don't be angry.
The flowers are so beautiful!
How come you don't know?
Kathleen is still living in North Africa, even during the time of the Civil War.
Seems like we need to do that.
"Listen to me, boys!
You've stopped the quest.
They've got a problem.
Take out the apple before you eat it.
He said he had to learn French.
Tom is swimming.
Maybe they're asleep.
We've got some good things waiting for us at home.
Close up your ass!
I smelled something was going on.
Crying!
I'd like to show you some of the recipes.
Well, I don't know him.
Tell him I love you.
Did you hear what they said?
I hope no one has seen you.
Mine is bigger than yours.
I told you what I had hidden in my heart.
"I love the tea.
"Drop it!
I moved to Boston on October 20th.
I'll buy it for you.
Tom has been stolen.
Keep on running!
Somebody's going to do it.
Go and get back.
This event is scheduled to take place several times a day.
Tom is sick.
Make it a small one.
- How are you?
Are you laughing at me?
His legs are red.
I'm surprised Mary didn't do that.
"Did you smoke?
Tom nodded.
"I left my keys in the car."
Wait on the outside.
"Do you like my friend?"
No one is listening.
I'm hurting my body.
Why didn't he want you here?
According to the police, Tom was shot with a knife before he cut off his leg.
I don't know what Mary is thinking.
No one remembers it.
What's your father's name?
Faith is not a gift. It's a gift for people to believe.
I won't let you go.
As soon as I got home, I went to bed.
These pictures are beautiful.
"Can you speak French?"
He hopes to be in Boston by the end of October.
- What are you doing?
help to me.
I forgot Mary's phone number.
I'm happy for you, aren't I?
I think I speak French better.
Sam was following me on Snapchat.
I saw a man talking to me.
"Send me to you.
He is one of the most famous people in Japan.
She's lying.
You're still?
Don't let go of unnecessarily.
Tom is the son of a well-known Boston teacher.
We can say, can't we?
I've bought some new bread.
They weren't the ones who came back.
Why is it that's this?
"You're our prisoners.
"You're crying now?
Forget it.
We haven't found it now.
Where'd you get this piece of clothing?
Do you want me to call him?
I want you to stay in London if you find someone to call.
I hope to see you in October.
I didn't think he needed our help.
Tom didn't know I knew.
It seems good.
Your father's got a good one.
He was the last person to see Mary.
He prayed at the table.
Leave it.
That's a yes.
Oh, how I've missed you!
Tom knocked on the door again.
You've been a fool?
It's never going to change.
He told someone to give him something to eat.
He likes to read books.
He went to see her while she was living in London.
Somebody's been coming.
The cat is back.
How's it going in Australia?
He likes to talk about art.
I need you to do something for me.
He didn't talk about Laila.
Let me take a look at what you've written.
He saw it, too.
Leave it to be sweet.
Tom is not married.
He's looking for his pen.
They understand.
The dates will be October 20th.
I'm waiting for a baby.
I can't see very well.
Shut up.
Hello. Hello.
I don't have any money in my pocket.
The sky is a great place for the people.
They all left.
You've made me.
I hope no one will see you here.
No one has ever seen you come to see you.
Why didn't you do that?
I only have one question.
We don't use it until it's necessary.
I'm hoping to play the game.
Get your asses off!
Come along with me.
Like Mary, she doesn't know how to speak French.
He gave it to Mary.
Read it on.
Say hello to me.
Oh, how I miss you!
Somebody's going to pay.
I like to watch some Western movies.
I hate Mary.
Please be quiet for me.
Oh, it's beautiful.
He's got a lot of good ideas.
Forbidden.
I don't have a lot of friends here in Boston.
We don't have anything to eat.
Are You Ready to Go?
Sammy went into the store.
Laugh at it, please.
I'd like to travel abroad.
Where do you live now?
He said he would be back on October 20th.
Be careful with calmness.
Call me if you have any questions.
I'm leaving now, if you please.
We hate you all.
He may come.
What kind of paper do you need?
"Shut up Tom!
No one has ever seen you come here.
"Would you like your dad to have dinner with you tonight?"
I came to Australia on the 20th of October.
She loves her.
I'm going to go out and get something to eat.
Get married.
Tom's performance showed me that he was doing well.
He's going to his father's room.
We must uphold the laws against discrimination in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the workplace, in the study and in the study of the environment. This is what our values and practices are all about.
"When are you coming to see me?"
The Coronavirus is caused by the virus.
Just tell him what you want.
It's EASY.
I'll go with you.
Are you going to be insane?
Tom was in front of Mary.
Just do what I've done!
You're wrong.
He built a big house.
Someone's been stealing my money.
They've messed up your writing.
I lied when I said I didn't like it.
No one stood up.
I'm going to start working in July.
There's a lot we can do to help our families.
I don't understand anything.
Tom is going to call Mary.
Tom threw out the car.
Mary's words are easy to understand.
They're waiting for you.
"You speak my language.
I'm happy here.
When Tom and I went to Boston, we visited Mary.
When you have the time to read this book.
I'll see him tomorrow.
Let me know if you'll reply to me sooner.
It's very hard for Tom.
What am I going to say!
I asked Tom Mary.
It's a long road.
Try to make it up.
Are you ready?
Somebody's been calling us.
You remind me of someone else.
Give up your bags.
We want to get to know you.
Do you like all the music?
I've watched.
They let the animals out of their cages.
Hurry up with your clothes.
So, what do you want?
He got up.
Mary and I are adorable.
That's good!
They all sat down.
"Wait for something!
Aren't you happy?
I've got your number.
Hello, is your name?
Tom and Mary knew that they had to do this.
They're looking for me.
Too much!
"You're a foreigner?
A lot of people are waiting.
He said to Mary, "Goodbye."
Keep away from your dreams.
I'll show you how it's done.
Say good-bye to your friends.
Maybe not.
Tom is out.
He knew that Mary was going to follow him.
It's too late running.
He was behind Tom's back.
read this book.
He said he didn't want to die.
They're still following us.
How long are you going to be home?
Is there anyone who's hurt?
I hope no one will see you here.
Tom's gone down.
This party isn't for you.
You're the one who built a house with roses and gowns.
Everybody knew it.
No one wants to be miserable.
I'll get you some food.
He's got us singing.
"Would you let us go now?
The river was very rough.
Read this book.
I can't take it off immediately.
I like it very much.
"I heard what happened.
Lana hadn't lived like that for years.
You've become an idiot?
He hates the Algerians.
I've followed the breeze.
That's my phone.
I can stay in New York until October.
Do you care what people think of us?
I'll be posting on Facebook every Thursday.
Sam is a criminal.
If you want to leave, go now!
I've seen you everywhere.
I think it's a beautiful place.
He said he wasn't just talking to you.
You're a part of the problem.
We've met before?
She speaks 10 different languages.
If you eat it, you'll die.
It's against time.
Well, that's all we have.
I think I understand it.
It's a little hot today.
She's my sister, isn't she?
Tom had been killed.
I'm always thinking about Mary.
Tom doesn't care about you.
It's beautiful dreams!
He said he'd never seen a car before.
"Did anyone see anything?
I know he's a millionaire.
You're screwed.
That'll warm you up.
I'm hoping it's a dream.
Love is blinding you.
You've ruined me!
Who's been complaining?
"You're Julia?
Do you have any other questions?
But that's not how Tom is.
You'll find someone.
Don't give up on you.
It's a Kabyle.
He didn't look at it.
You're human?
All my problems are over.
"No one has ever seen you come here.
Alice smiled at her.
I'm not really a man or a woman.
Please close the door with the key.
Let's live life!
I don't want to go alone.
He said to the carpenter, "I'll take it off." He said, "What shall I say?"
God will be like you, and He will be like you.
Somebody's got to do that.
My son has become a man.
What if I asked a question that didn't work?
I've got you caught.
"I know Tom.
You've read?
I've lost.
A few months ago, he wrote a poem about his mother's death.
"Shut up your face!
She's looking out.
He is a great singer for Mary.
Did you learn how to cook or something else?
He likes to play football.
Sammy still has a guitar.
They all love you.
I can't believe both of them.
Where's your grandpa?
Get out of there!
They all sang.
If you don't speak the same language as your mother tongue, you'll be more likely to learn from the mistakes.
You've done all that?
Let them help you.
You're going to redo it?
They didn't ask for help, just like Mary did.
I don't trust where there are no people.
Those who are in a state of disrepair are in a state of disrepair.
Tom and Mary have the same personality.
Is there anyone who's dead?
No one cares.
Tom's got it.
"You're lying?
I don't think it will rain tomorrow.
I'm doing what needs to be done.
Sami read the message from Laila.
I want you to get up.
But you refuse to pay.
Tom continued to read.
"You're lying?
Mary liked it, too.
You have to do this work.
I think you did it without your consent.
She's reading English.
let me know.
You've got the ball?
Everybody's got a hand.
Tom and Mary are like John and Alice.
Selbent.
You need to talk to me.
Who's running?
Tom's birthday is October 20th.
Forget it.
It's a great piece of furniture that I know of.
Tom was shocked.
I saw a dog.
I'm afraid very much.
"Help me.
The festival will start in October.
Please tell me who's going to help us.
"I can't just leave you here.
Sammy doesn't know who she is.
What's the name of this fruit?
"Please take me home.
I hope no one has seen you do that.
I love the way you kiss me.
You've finished your work?
What's the Language?
You are a good student.
That's art?
You'll find someone who has left you.
Who's are they?
You're embarrassed?
You've got a lot of good ideas.
Stop it!
I'm going to follow Mary.
Don't worry, it's easy.
"Why do you need a knife?"
Tom is pissed.
Get back to us!
If you don't want to read, stop reading.
You're crazy?
I bought a steakhouse.
We jumped over there.
Let's dance.
Please, please.
Somebody's got to do something.
They fell.
You're finished?
Maybe it's your friend?
Mary knew that she believed him.
You've changed your clothes!
We wanted to hear it.
Aren't you happy that you're rich?
Take a look at this. What do you see?
Tell me what you want and I won't believe you.
Your life is different from mine.
Sammy went out that night.
Take this.
They're all joking.
He knew that no one had seen him.
"What do you want your dog to eat?"
I'm not your love.
Sami went to the game.
He arrived in Boston in October.
The moon is still shining.
THANK YOU for your call.
There's someone I've seen.
Thank you for inviting us to dinner.
Tom was waiting for him.
He didn't smoke anymore, he said.
You've fooled me!
Kurt Cobain died on April 5, 1994 in Seattle.
I will be back in October.
Well, I have a daughter.
Tom was feeling unwell.
The aristocracy is in control.
She's coughing very well.
I'm going to pay.
The affair is over.
"Can you watch Tom?"
He bought it for us.
I don't want to go to the party.
I like to read.
Tom was very upset with Mary.
Give me a pound of tomatoes, please.
Hold on to your power.
Sam felt that something was going on in his head.
Ken is happy.
You've got to eat something.
We're done?
"Send me there."
Why did you write this book?
I want Mary.
Don't stop saying it!
No one is inside.
Say bye-bye.
But you can't stop us.
My grandfather, who was still in the early stages of life, always knew how to dress.
That's for you.
Don't forget to tell him to do it.
It's useful!

"Please eat your dog every day."
I've got to see Tom.
You're the one for me.
Just let me in.
So, you're Canadian?
You're waiting for me.
I'm still looking at Tom.
The event will take place until October 20th.
<0xC5><0xA2>-k.
What you said is true.
I have to go to the next one.
Is there anyone you want to read?
It's useful!
Well, I can kill you.
Are you ready to eat it?
He told me he loved you very much.
Take care of everything.
Tea, please, please.
I'm feeling well myself.
Let go of the animals.
He said he'd come back.
"I'm glad you called me.
Shut up!
Sammy and Laila were kissing each other.
It looks like you're from Japan.
Let's go to school!
Well, I have.
Sami taught me how to play the guitar.
I've seen you.
I'll make you coffee.
I've told him many times.
"There's something I've shown you to Mary.
She's very nice.
That's what's going to happen.
Mary told me that she was lucky.
"Did you see a lot of them?
You're giving me a break!
It's no problem.
You're Laughing.
We've got to say it again.
There was someone who knew something.
I've heard of Tom.
You're relaxing.
Just check out my new car.
I've chosen.
You've got a fever.
We remember.
Who's won?
Read This!
Tom is going to be missed.
I don't even know if I have the time.
The one you found was Tom's.
Sam picked up his little girl.
You understand it.
He said he wanted to speak French.
There's someone in the house.
Tom is involved.
Check them out.
Listen to it all!
Tell me what you like about it.
You're stupid.
Just follow him on.
Tom looked me in the eye.
He may be coming.
I need someone to help me.
"Why do you need me?
You've helped me!
Would you like to give me a Japanese version?
She saw Laila once a year.
come on to us.
You don't need to do that.
There's someone watching Tom.
So, how did he find it?
Emmet!
Say goodbye to your friends, too.
They're walking up to the gate.
I did this without any help from anyone.
Don't let me cut my head off.
He didn't think anyone would do that.
Sam didn't need that.
I can go home to you tomorrow.
I'm not going to swim today.
He doesn't have a word.
Tom seems to be very happy.
I was born in this hospital.
You're a tyrant?
I need you to do something for me.
Tell me the TRUTH.
He's been in Boston since last October.
You've got a lot of wigs in your teeth.
Give it to whoever you want.
Do you have a lot of friends who don't eat meat?
Do you have time to eat?
They're all happy.
He asked us to shut up.
She died of a stroke.
Give me something I don't know.
Who's got him?
Mary would have to start.
It's true.
Let go!
Don't make any mistakes.
You're doing the chicken.
Yes, I know.

We need to be stopped by someone.
There's someone waiting for you.
Don't stop using it.
Tell him.
Well, I know.
He was working with Mary.
Tom threw out the beans.
He was the only one at the party.
Do you know me? - No, I don't think so.
I think she can understand Mary.
Hello, all of you.
God is Suffering.
I hope he'll leave me alone.
It's your turn, my friend.
Do you know how that works?
Follow in your sister's footsteps.
I'm worried about him.
Put them all out.
Tom and Mary are different from black and white.
I've never had a chance to read or write.
This will make you stronger.
It's your father, Tom.
It's a 1-inch.
"Why don't you go to Tom's house?"
You look like you're awesome tonight.
Tom is out now.
He died in October.
The work is going well.
I think he was right about Mary.
We all hated him.
They bought a bottle of water.
You were supposed to do it yesterday.
That's what love is?
Is there something you don't like to eat?
Someone's been driving my car.
I did not read.
He's going to protect us.
A friend of mine and his friends wrote a book.
Tom wanted to get out early.
You're doing it now.
He left the country on October 20th.
How do we get rid of the British?
She needs to rest.
You've already paid.

I've written a lot of things in Kathmandu, but it's been a long time.
Who are you waiting for to succeed?
Tom likes the squirrels.
Football is very popular among Japanese teachers.
He said to the carpenter, "I'll take it off." He said, "What shall I say?"
I'll show you how it's done.

There was water for two days.
"Do you have cats?"
She wanted to help Mary.
Tom is a very good boy.
"Didn't you read this book?"
You can't speak French, can you?
Wrong.
She will stay with him.
When's the flight to Boston?
"I heard you didn't eat meat.
I've bought the word.
Tom launched his blog in October.
Did you try to eat all of that?
You're not really involved.
Are you a U.S. citizen?
Please tell me the other ones.
I thought you couldn't read it.
Your writing is very beautiful.
Tom was soon to die.
The chicken is fried, and the chicken is fried.
Stop with them!
He only slept for an hour.
"Why are you talking to me?
Try to do more.
I didn't think I was going to get that tired.
Call me back anytime you want.
"You can use my dictionary."
Tom still wants to go with you.
You've said that now.
Tom's got it.
"Did you swim last night?"
Let's get started!
When was the last time you came to Boston?
He said he had written the book for two years.
He stayed here for a long time.
I'm afraid for you.
You've read this?
I've Laughed.
You're scared.
You can go home now.
You are a dog.
Some people swim in the river.
What's the amount of food?
Well, thank you all.
Tom is on his own.
"Because you've been here a lot.

I'm now married to Tom.
Someone's been stealing my food.
You're pissed.
What are you looking for, man?
Els.
What's the number of your room?
I told the TRUTH.
Do you have any friends?

She's better at singing.
I'd say you love your work.
These notebooks aren't mine.
I made you a coffee.
He was brought back to work in October.
James is very well-rounded.
Clean up your room.
"Why don't you go see Tom?"
He told me he loved me.

You're Hungry?
Tom didn't know how to explain it.
"Can I go home now?"
You're lying.
There's nothing going to get you out of the way.
He called me to say he didn't want to.
Poetry is medicine.
Let's say it again.
It started with this man.
Go to the site!
"What do you like more meat or fish?"
Get out.
I'm having lunch for you today.
He won't be back until October.
"Can you open the door for me?"
Somebody's been knocking on the door.
I'd like to forget about Mary.
He ran down to see what was going on.
You've found out what this is!
It doesn't hurt like the truth.
Well, he can do that.
Singing.
I'm afraid it's going to rain tonight.
He never kept his word.

I'm speaking French.
I didn't talk to anyone, I wasn't afraid.
Someone's been stealing from me.
Do you want to come to New York this weekend?
For whom?

If you continue to work in a place like this.
It's clever.
B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-
Tom's heart was broken with a heartbeat that came from the jungle.
It seemed as if he was looking at me.
I don't have any interest in this matter.
There was snow in the river.
Kissed her.
He's smelling it!
Oh, I forgot.
Somebody's got to stop you.
He was afraid of Mary.
It's all about my things.
You need to talk to me.
Write it in French.
Something's happened.
You're staying.
Speak in haste.
He didn't like to wait until he found something to do.
I've been talking to Tom.

Don't you remember!
"Please don't die.
He will be in third place on October 20th.

You've got a very nice smile.
Who's got this book?
I'm sure he loves Mary.

You idiot!
Take good care of your journey.
It's pretty cool, isn't it?
You're dancing.
Someone had told him about it.
I hope no one will see you here.
He speaks a lot of English.
Tom was completely out of his mind.
You're feminists.
You kissed?
Thank you for your donations.
That's the wine?
You're warned.
We need to think about what's going to happen.
"Are you rich?"
Tom took it to sleep.
I'm going to school with him.
I want you to work with them.
Be patient with her.
Let go of me!
Mary and Tom went to see him.
He's a good writer.
Where's your uncle?
Tom asked for a good look.
She's blind.
I'm tearing my eyes.
But he wasn't inside.
I felt like I was alone these days.
I'm hoping for some light and flowers in your garden.
Shame on me.
I'm guessing that's not true.
Stay with me.
Which team do you like?
It's been lost.
So?
I'll dream of you.

She got up.
He's at home today.
"Please read it again.
Do I have to ask a question that doesn't work?
Tom started to talk.
"Can you wait a minute, please?
Now, let me remind you of something.
I've never tried to do that again.
"Can you help me?
Hey, can you wait?
I'm going to tell you a secret.
I can teach you how to read.
You're too self-sufficient!
Somebody's got to do something.
Tom's going to the party.
Sami didn't get the last message.

You can call me if you want to call me soon.
They think they're the only ones who are right.
You've read this?
I'm going to call you on Monday.
"No, I don't know your brother.
I'm not running.
What's going on now?
That's this?
Are You Trying to Me?
I won't wash my car.
I was born in Boston.

But you refuse to pay.
He's checking it?
I haven't said anything yet.
We were FRIENDS.
I wrote you a note.
I'll meet you downstairs.
It's a word.
Somebody's been watching you.
Look in front of you.
I like to read the books.
I'm glad you won.

How many of them do you need?
Come back to us.
I love the walk.
Tom and I are very good friends.
"Sorry, where are the eggs?"
"Stay inside.
I'm going to the hospital every weekend to see Mary.
Tom made a splash.
You're ashamed?
Tom put his feet on the ground.

You can't go in there.
Oh, how beautiful you are!
Find me.
I just want to get married.
I like the reading.
Write it in French, though.
Are you going to do that for me?
I know he's calling me.
He lives on the beach, but he doesn't know how to swim.

Are you looking for someone?
I'm waiting for Tom.
He turned to Mary.
Please, please read this book.
We'll wait for you here.

You're being punished?
You're looking for food?
Don't stop tossing!
You can't trust Mary.
Somebody's seen you.
We fought.
It's solved the problem!
Everybody's got you wrong.
Answer me with a word.

We need to save him right away.
We're going to send someone.
You must be eating a lot.
I've been trying to find another one.
"How much do you eat?"
Hey, how's Tom?
This has to stop.
Tom is sick.
"Did anyone hit you?"
I'm interested in Mary.
What are you all afraid of?
Just send me one of them now.
Get some food.
What's the story you like?
The dog was surprised.
Tom, are you waiting for me?
I wish them a year of peace and prosperity.
She's stopped talking.
Do it again again.
You've been lucky.
You can change it if you want to.
Don't stop telling me.
It's just a cup of tea you want.

You have to do this in your own way.
Leave her to be nice.
Did you eat as much as possible?
You're idiots.
"I know you're here."
She's hiding her secrets.
"Why are you angry?
It's not that hard to do.

I think it's a beautiful place.
I need to see someone.
You've become a fool?
Tom's been reading slowly.
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
Did you check them?
She remained silent there.
Somebody's got to do that.
"Are you a Christian?
I'm living in Australia.
I think Tom is a badass.
You're lying.
Do you know how to teach?

Why do you think Tom?
"Have you found yourself?

My mother gave me a new dress.
Do you've been lucky?
I've lost my mind.

You're tired?
Look at this .
Exam!
So, why are you here?
Tom's almost finished.
Don't know what tomorrow will be.
I can't do that without your help.
I love the life.
"Did you see anyone here?"
What's the plan we're getting ready for?
There's some Poles.
"You told the dog to stay, didn't you?"
Reading and writing in California has become a problem for us.
You know you're surprised.

I'm going to ask for a couple more questions.
Somebody's been calling.
They all Laughed.

He said he wanted to learn French.
You can get your money back if you want to.
They left early.
Keep listening to it!
Mary was picked up by Mary.
Mary was pregnant.
Are you at home?
Tell me when you'll call me.

"Why did you call?
Someone is waiting for you.
Mary is better than the rest of the time.

He answered them to you.
It's worth it.
You're gone.
Do you think I'm going to live?

Look behind you.
I'm here for you.
I don't want to hurt you, I want to help you.

What do you want to do?
Come and see me.

You've been a good one?
Sam was singing.

Please, please correct it.
I don't like to eat where people eat.

Why are you so afraid of that?
I'm still at home, but I'll be home tomorrow.

There's nothing to be ashamed of.
There's someone waiting for me.

Call me if you want to talk to me soon.
I ate the cakes.
The paper is good.
You're drunk?
"Did you see a lot of them?

Do you think I should do that?
Do you like it bad?
It's time against time.
I have a fever.
Ask them if they want one.
We've achieved some success without success.
They tried to get me married.
The animals drink the water.
Let's play some game.
I don't think he likes Boston.
I don't know what I was waiting for.
"Please respond to me.
You escaped.
I was surprised to see you.
And don't forget your money.

There are things that break.
It doesn't work much anymore.
James is a fun one.
"Why do you wash your hands?"
I'll take some very expensive ones.

You've heard that!

Someone had opened the door.
Get up and fall!
I'd like to go swimming tomorrow.
Tom is dancing.
You don't want to succeed, do you?
If you don't want to do it, don't do it!
He's not there.
Get me some milk, too.
The moon's already blooming.
Oh, you freaks!
"Can you please wait a minute?"
He solved the problem.
It's your turn!

I think we're all here.
We won't leave you.

That's where Tom is.
I like the French.
I've been walking.
The birds are flying.
Snuffset!
He's got his job done for you.
He called Mary to tell her about his death.
Let the water run.

I'm listening to music.
What do you think of your dog?
We have a black dog.
Tom is watching.
Who are you talking to?
I have two friends and a couple.
I want to see who's calling.
That's it!
It's just a joke.
He has been in Australia since October.
Can you find him? - Yes.
I saw a dog.
Tom was interested in it.
Would you like to try it?
He died on October 20 in Boston.
Stay here.
I thought someone had died.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I think Mary and Tom are right.
What do you think of Boston?
We're worried about you.

Don't worry, the day is coming!
He's said it many times.
Are you happy?
He's not hungry for bread.
Who's going to pay for that?
Well, let's try something.
I've never forgotten you.
You're finished?
I want to marry him, but I still don't know.
I'm sure I can do that.
You're dumb.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
You're all being invited.

You've cleaned up your room.
Who doesn't agree?

Do you remember what he said?
Ah, kill!

So, what do you want?
I'm glad to be back.
He said he wanted to learn French.
Have you ever worked with them?
I want you to work with them.

Get out of the problem!
You're crazy.

My life is in your hands.
Do it-
You're a fool?
We need somebody else.

I think there's someone in the room.
Please respond to it.

I'm speaking your language.
I will never ever forgive you.

I hope you didn't tell me to do that.
But I won't forget it all.
She didn't laugh at me anymore.
"He's talking to Tom.
I can't help you today.
I met her once in a while.
I'm infuriated.
So?
STOP there.
Of course, he loves her, too.
I'm afraid for you.
She's a pretty girl, but she's very much alive.

Theblemt.
Very good.
You'd better cut off your hair.
If you put your money in your pocket, you'll find a treasure in heaven.
It's obviously art.
I'll never forget you.
I'm a human.
Have you seen the new movie?
They all nodded.
Tell me the way to go.
Where's the book?
But I don't eat fruit.
What are you going to eat tomorrow?
"When will you come back from Boston?"
Go away from me.
Give it to whoever you want.
He took Mary's place.
He held my hand.
"Why can't we play tennis today?"
you've read?
Hit him for it.
You shouldn't have to work.
"Are you going to stop Tom?"
"I want to eat here tonight."
"Did you see the star?
Do you write in French?
My sister's going to tell you.
Two beers, please.
You're afraid of Tom.
Tom picked up the apple pie for me.
The little cat sat on the back of the cat.
I'm a stranger.
Somebody's been eating us.
It's where everything is waiting to be.
From your heart?
"Do you have any girls?
He is a young boy who follows the teachings of his parents and teachers.
Hello, once again.
You've got the names.
Are You Afraid of Me?
If you want something, I have something for you.
Switzerland is a country of railways.
Arabic is not my language, it's my language.
You're scared?
October was a difficult one.
You've read this?
Maybe it's not.
There's someone inside.
I don't care if you kiss me.
That's the reading I want.
Open the Door.
Tom and I are going to Boston to see Mary.
It's your father, Tom.
Tom was the first to complete the test.
This time it's no different.
I'm sorry.
Well, it's raining.
She went to visit him while he was living in London.
Somebody's been calling now.
I want you to work with them.
October was a busy month for me.
We're thanking you all.
I have to read.
Take Tom to the house.
I'm going to eat here.
The truth is real.
I ate it.
I've been to Boston a long time.
What do you want for us?
She wants to marry Mary.
He couldn't drive.
Sam knows where she lives.
Why do you think I need help with it?
I don't want to kiss you.
You're not helping me.
I'm not going to eat at home tonight.
Look at it.
You're happy.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
He picked up the tree and went straight to the market.
Take this one.
How much are you going to go?
Sami was tired of it.
"Why are you crying?
You guys! You want to put down the key! I didn't see it!
When it's dark, people go to their homes.
They were all happy.
The fire was burning at night.
Why Are You Alone?
"I love the parties.
Well, you have to try.
Get your hands off me.
We're not leaving you.
It's good to swim.
France is a country.
Get to know them.
"Just wait here.
There's someone who's Tom.
Mary built it.
Tom and Mary are smiling at each other.
Someone's been knocking on the door.
Sami used to eat in the kitchen.
You're going to have a little sister.
Tom's not good enough.
She had lost everything she had.
behind you.
Who's standing up?
Take a look at Tom.
He said he knew who did it.
Tom is very rich.
I'm not talking about that with him.
Who knows what it's about.
What's your friend's name?
I told you it would work.
You're crazy.
You've been blind to love.
It's like football in this country.
I'm not going.
I'm licking my clothes.
You're going to run fast!
See you, Ian.
Don't give up on us.
Stop with them.
I think it's my birthday on October 20th.
Get on with it!
"Are you blind?"
Eat all you want.
How much longer do we have to wait?
The life is beautiful.
It's windy.
Oh, it's beautiful!
Why didn't you take him home?
Tom was screaming.
The whole dictionary isn't good.
"Did you find anything?
When you're welcome, you're welcome.
You're wrong, Tom.
Do not play.
I'm very worried about you.
They were all outside.
"What do you want from Tom?"
Why do you want all of these?
Do you think I'm talking about it?
If you can't do it, no one can.
I really need to eat something.
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.
You're Hungry?
They've got a problem.
Let's get your clothes on!
Tom is going to get it.
When did you learn to speak French?
I've played the guitar.
"Why not?
I'm going to ask Tom to do that.
"Did you find anything?
I know that he really loved me.
I like to go to sleep.
Tom and Mary have the same idea.
I hate all of you.
Do you know what Tom's password is?
You can talk to him at his house tonight.
We know it wasn't you who killed him.
Sam was in Thailand.
You've tried to do this to me.
Tell me who you are!
No one knows why.
That's what love is?
You're going to survive?
I can see Mary.
One, two, three, go!
You're worried?
"I heard someone talking.
I thought I was Mary.
Who's the boy?
We don't have a book.
How many eggs do you eat per week?
Tell him what you want.
Somebody was talking to.
You've read that?
I'm waiting for a call this morning.
What do you want to say all this?
You have to follow the rules.
You've done what's best for those who hate you.
What do you want?
Don't get dirty.
It's really sad.
I need someone to talk to.
Say 'ahh'.
But I don't like Tom.
Let me look at what you've written.
Keep on Laughing.
He was quick to write the paper.
We need more evidence.
When you're welcome, you're welcome.
Is there anyone you want to see?
Come along with me.
Be to you.
You've got a good time.
I'm just saying, it's been a while.
You're a Canadian?
I hope I will do it too.
There was no room at Tom's house.
Somebody's got to talk.
I respect you.
October 20th is a great day.
At once, it started to rain.
Tom was driving faster than Mary's.
Write your name.
Somebody's been killed.
No one spoke.
You can get your money back if you want to.
I don't miss you on this.
It's our car.
I believe you.
Do what you like.
I'm tired of the TV.
No one ate the car.
Will you be able to help me again?
They're all waiting.
Your success depends on your difficulty.
Who's got your teeth hurt?
Please come today if you want to.
Tom lied to me.
"How much did you eat?"
Can I have a look at the list, please?
Don't be yourself!
He was trying to save Mary.
He thanked me when he wanted to do it.
You need someone like me.
"It's your father, Tom.
I didn't know I liked that.
You're mad?
Take it all.
"Did you drink Tom?"
Laila didn't come out of the closet.
What are you going to do with that?
I didn't read it well.
"Who invited you to the party?"
She kissed Mary.
We're impressed.
I don't understand how this could happen.
The pen you've got is now mine.
What did you say to him?
I'm going to be friends with Tom.
How long do you have to stay in Boston?
He likes to speak French.
He stayed at home.
Leave it to you.
What did you learn to tell me?
The year of snow is a year of snow.
It's snowing, but it's very cold.
"Shut up!
I need to figure out how to get out of here.
He went to the bar to get some beers.
I think he's a lot older than me.
Take it easy on yourself.
We've got one?
Please be quiet, please.
Sam believes in his mother.
But I can't do anything else.
Hokkaido is located in northern Japan.
He was born in Australia.
They've waited.
Did you hear what they said?
I'm a tactful.
"Who told you he was going to be here?"
"Can you come to us?
How do they know?
He saw me all at once.
Give it to Tom.
"Have you found yourself?
You look like a baby.
It looks like I've been back a long time.
I've never tried to drive a car.
He ran outside to see what had happened.
It's the kind of guy I like.
Who's survived?
He stopped at a place of rest.
It's Halloween in October.
"Why don't you do anything?
He gave me a lot of money.
You're new?
Get in!
The cat survived.
You work a lot.
Somebody's come to our house.
My husband is a good man.
Tom had a reason for it.
He said he had never heard Mary sing.
I'd say I slept with him.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I will never love him as much as I love you.
"Who speaks French?"
Do you have a home in Australia?
Leave 'em.
Tom is pissed.
Tom was out of his mind.
I like to go in.
Someone was sleeping on the bed.
You've got a book.
Mary and her husband wanted to buy a house.
He told me that he had seen someone who had given him a gift.
I like the apples.
I went to a Halloween party.
Who'd they talk to?
We've lost.
I believed you.
"I'm here in Luxemburg.
Well, I know EVERYTHING.
It's cold to me.
Did you read it?
He's dead.
He returned home in three hours.
He let his dogs go.
I love you very much.
Get back home early.
Tom went into the kitchen.
You're dead.
I don't think he's been calling us.
The apples are great.
I'm overwhelmed by life.
They've won.
It's easy to use it.
You don't have a heart.
Just stay where you are.
You're an idiot!
Somebody has to do that.
If I had, I would have told you.
I'm writing a book, and you want me to read it to you?
"Can you help me, please?"
You're checking them?
Thank you for telling us that.
This is my brother's.
They all died.
"Is that Tom?"
Learnt!
"We need a car.
I don't eat fish if I can't.
"Call them.
Please just tell me what's going on.
Tom is terrified.
When I'm back from church, I like to drink a glass of wine before I go to sleep.
She built it.
I'm going to be 30 in October.
in your calmness.
Tom is very heavy.
Tom stood up.
It's not a problem!
Now it's time to go home.
He's coming here!
Sami bought two pairs on Amazon.
Axe!
you're using?
"He's working for you?
The words "heads" and "heads" come from a single tree and are "heads": a tree of the fingers that can be headed.
The women are spoiled.
You're all crazy.
Sami is ready.
He likes to speak French.
Do not smoke.
Is there anyone who can speak Spanish?
Don't eat that.
But he didn't see Tom.
"Send me over there.
Which of your brothers is the greatest?
That happens sometimes.
"Why did you call?
I'm continuing to sing.
We all know it's his car.
You're smoking?
He's changed his situation a lot.
It's hard to keep working in this position.
I understand.
Tom's laughing.
Mary wasn't surprised.
Tom had changed his job.
They're birds.
There's no hope for her.
Let's get the light.
Don't stop the agitation!
I'm like a friend here.
You'd better not do that while you're here.
The girls love both of you.
Tom and I have not known each other for a long time.
I saw a man who gave him a gift.
Can you give it to me?
I'm back with Tom today.
There is nothing better than love.
I'll be in Boston on October 20th.
"Where did you learn Italian?"
Let's try something.
I'll go with you.
Don't stop crying.
"Did you see my sister?
Laila had a hard time.
"Look and see!
Tell them the TRUTH.
We've succeeded.
I don't wash my car.
I met a man whose father knew him.
I'm not here to do you any harm.
They've sent you away.
Sam ran to the beach.
Smile.
Someone had opened the door.
I thought we were friends.
Are you ready for it?
I'd like to eat Chinese for dinner.
"Shut up your room!"
You have to follow the rules.
She's a Kathleen.
"We're having guests tonight.
Listen to me!
The church joins the Algerian Protestant Church, a foundation for the Protestant Churches.
You're a cook in the kitchen.
Somebody's got a look at Tom.
Do you watch TV every day?
You're not going to eat too fast, are you?
Life goes on.
Is it really Adam's fault?
I love you as you are.
He's been talking about you all day.
No one had gone there.
They've lost.
You've got to eat something.
Sya.
I asked Mr. Smith.
"Your sister is more than all the other students.
You can't get in on that.
It looks good .
He stole the money from his mother's bank account.
Don't you know that Mary is still here?
Tom inermes Mary.
"How long have you been here?"
Now, look at you.
you're saying.
Please help us.
Who's you?
I've only felt it a little bit.
Mary didn't know she loved him.
Boys and girls play together.
"Your eyes are lying.
No one knows it.
I'm listening to the music.
"I'm going to Tom.
He didn't ask Mary to help him.
He was jailed for writing the book.
"I know your language.
The art is long, the life is short.
Tom is ready to work.
"I don't want to talk about my son.
Tom and I are married to each other.
Tom is pissed.
I haven't seen you since Halloween.
Forget it.
Well, we can do something.
He ran.
Tom is looking at Mary.
Sami stood up and prayed for him.
Who's going to be there if he isn't?
Someone would like to send a letter.
He was assassinated in October.
Seems like you know how to do that.
They're the same age.
No one told me it would be so cold.
You're not helping me.
This time it's back.
I believe him.
October 20th was a very hot day.
There is nothing more true than the truth.
He thinks like a child.
Tom is a very smart boy.
"Why did you go there?
"Where are your dogs?"
Tom was in doubt about it.
What are you going to do this weekend?
Half of the work is finished.
Some of it comes from religion.
He tried to keep his eyes open.

My dog is black.
Your mother is eating.
Mary is a chef.

They love the language of Kathleen.
I know you'll be able to do that.
Somebody's been calling us.
I know who's good.
"Wait outside.
He's really hating my ass.
I want someone to say it.
Cut out the room.
There's something you've been hiding.
you are here?
Didn't you know he was going to Boston with Mary?
He wanted to kill Mary.
It's a good idea to agree with one another.
You're so cute, I have to do it!
It's snowing.
Somebody's got their cat.
It's snowing all over the country.
Somebody's been on their own.
He can do whatever he likes.
Please, please, don't be angry.
Someone's been stealing my car.
"Did you call?
You are the love of my life.
If it's hot, we'll make it with olive oil.
Aren't you tired?
Do you like all the music?
I was in Boston last year on October 20th.
Get out quickly.
I'm not your slave.
"Why are you alone?
No one answered.
It's true.
I was on the right.
I wonder why he didn't do the job.
I don't need your work.
It's been a long time since she won the award.
She didn't kiss Mary.
We'll see you for dinner.
Tom has done a great job for us.
I wonder if he likes me.
He likes to eat eggs.
Can you give me a drink, please?
Tom nodded.
"How are you, Tom?
That's great. No one's blocking it.
It's a good life.
I've lost my pen.
Who's gone with you?
Are you ready?
Would you like to go to Boston?
Tom's been gone ever since.

She picked up the car and went straight to the market.
He began to fear.

"I hate the fight.
Tom continued to read.
I didn't say he wasn't okay.
They've all found themselves.

What he said doesn't make any sense.

So, you're German?
Maybe he needs to do it, too.
She kissed me.
There's someone coming.
She said she didn't like him.
They've got wine.
We can!
You're dying?
She is dying in fear.
Come on over here.
Did you have an answer?
He was talking about Mary.

They've all gone.
"Do you have a brother, Anna?"
Good Luck to you.
No one knows why.
Is there anyone who is going to heal?
I was so excited to get out of the phone.
If you'd like something.
I won <0x24>100 a day.
Tom has never been forgotten.
Tom knocked on the door in anger.
We are the light of sight.
He sent him a message.
Take it all.
You know very well how this happened.
Did anyone know what he was doing?
He knew Tom.
Let go of me!
I've heard it differently.
This project was approved in October of last year.
I didn't sleep early.
Tom and Mary stayed behind.

I want to come with you.
It's good for your coffee.
You have to come with me.
Is there anyone who's going to heal them?
I'm going to talk to you again.
Someone's been stealing from me.

I haven't seen them since October.
Now, let's eat!
Do you have a good time to drink?
I'm glad you won.
You're so stupid?
Tom had arrived.
Sam was in Egypt.
You seem to be surprised.
We need to see each other when we get to know each other.
She didn't smile at me anymore.
The sun shines like snow in the sun.
Tom will be able to wait.
This is also not true.
It's LOUD.
I have to tell somebody.
I'm here for you.

He's got more money than Mary.
Can't you take it?
Have you been to Japan?
Swimming in the night is fun.
Stop apologizing.
What did he say?
Don't be afraid to dream.
I'm not friends with Tom.
I hate it when we do that.
Tom was flaunting himself like a cockroach.
He didn't want to do anything for Mary.
Life is good.
Squeeze yourself.
France is our second country.
Well, I can call.
"Please, please, call me in.
Is it the time you need?
Maybe it'd be better if he came with us.
Sammy's wife is very proud of you.
I know everything about them.
You've got this.
You don't have a heart.
We'll be waiting for you here.
"I'm not your servant.
I'd like to go see a movie.
Open up your eyes.
you're coming?
He's got problems like that.
I'm with Tom.
He knew that Mary had done it.
You're on your own.
Can you do that?
Is there someone you would like to read?
Just take me home.
I've been a snake.
Do you know how to swim?
Please go on, please!
I'm going to ask you something.
It's so easy in French.
We know.
I want to put my tongue out in French.
We met a writer.
You can buy a book and read it whenever you want, whenever you want.
You're scared?
What I'm saying makes sense?
Who's replying?
Did you see him?
Someone's been stealing my watch.
Your son is a beautiful young man.
I miss him.
Maybe we'll try something.
I hope no one saw you when you did this.
Someone was sleeping on the bed.
But you're not Japanese.
I'm not your slave.
Let go of me.
I know you're a teacher.
It was raining in the morning.
He's asleep.
Tom is obsessed with Mary.
I liked it when he was with Mary.
"It's not over yet," said Stacey.
Mary is better than me.
I'd like to see.
He knew that Mary was following him.
Can you make a change?
Everything is good for you.
What if I don't have a question?
Can I have a look at the menu, please?
You talked to them, didn't you?
Somebody's got me on my back.
I'll give you my car.
Get out of here!
Sam began to tell a story.
Tom is always on my mind.
Are you Laughing?
There's a little pride in you!
Maybe there's something you've seen.
Tom and Mary were pissed.
Don't ever complain!
He opened the door and told Mary John he wasn't home.
It didn't happen anything.
Amelia just wanted to.
Somebody is Wrong.
I love Latin because it's the language I love.
Somebody's been listening.
Tom seems to be very happy.
"Why are you reading this?
I'm drinking a glass of ros<0xC3><0xA9>.
What kind of games do you like?
"Can you read that?
He went to Boston last week.
I'm tired of Monday night.
So you're an idiot?
"You're German?"
I'll find a way.
He didn't eat pizza last night.
What time do you have to eat?
Turn to the left!
Tom's in Boston, but Mary's not here.
Someone's been calling the security guards.
Stay in the back.
Doesn't it matter to us?
Looks like it's good.
Everybody was talking.
Open the Door.
I just got your letter from you.
I don't want to eat beer.
The bag is very heavy.
I've got something to give you.
What are you going to drink?
Good luck, too!

Well, I can kill you.
Well, it went well.

You're up.
They want to become citizens.
Stop them! Stop them!
Have you read the book yet?
"That's your slave, isn't it?"
I'm going to talk about poems.
Do you know what I want to say?
It's the same as last time.
Do you think I should do that?
We are on a Thursday.
You're starting to.
It's going to snow today.
He's a child in his mind.
Tom doesn't have any.
Tom's face turned red.
He needs someone to see him.
She's been taking this medication every few hours.
I was very happy to be back in London.
Sami knows who he is.
It's just the fun you want.
What a beautiful city it is.
He doesn't always tell the truth.
Someone came into the room.
The snow has stopped.
I miss you very much.
I need to see somebody.
Tom and I are married.
"Stop crying!
I'm going to try to get Tom to do that.
She likes the oranges.
He knew something about it.
"Could you please wait a minute?"
Can I take a picture of you with me?
The one for you.
Is my response good enough?
Time is running out.
Who told you it didn't work?
What are you going to do tomorrow?
Tom and Mary got married in October.
Are you waiting for me?

But I don't understand art.
Get away from me!

We'd better go.
"Please help me, please.
Are you going to be crazy?
I've been to you, have you?
You're doing well in English.
"Why didn't you call him and remind him?"
Dreaming with ease.
This is Mary's husband.
Tom is a writer.
Can you get me a cup of coffee, please?
I bought a bottle of water.
She said she didn't like her job.
It's a bad life, it's a bad world!
The store is closed on Mondays.
Tom woke up very well.
Do you have any other questions to ask?
"You can call me tonight."
Only for the big ones.
It's better not to talk to him.
Bring on Tom.
We talked.
What's in the room?
There's something you've seen.
I've been to Ken.
Everybody's dreaming.
I'm able to forgive you.
Can anyone tell me why I'm so upset about it?
That's for you.
Take out the pics.
I've found a place where we can be alone.
Well, I can kill you.
I apologise.
It's snowing.
Just take a look.
I've always loved Mary.
The spring has come.
No one will believe us.
Be kind to you.
I called home.
He didn't stop talking to us.
Somebody's been calling you.
Your mother is eating.
"Wake up, why are you so hot, why are you so cold?"
Why don't you eat something?
It's a good idea, isn't it?
That day was a blissful one.
Say "aah".
Tom walked in front of Mary.
Someone's been stealing my money.
Take a look at it!
What a mess, Tom.
Speak up quickly.
I'm not used to working outside.
You have friends, don't you?
They're all joking.
You've been working since yesterday.
At the end of the day, the house was quiet.
Well, I can kill you.
We're going to go ahead and take our shoes.
They are to me.
"Where does your grandmother live?"
He let his dogs go.
Tell them I'm here.
It's an easy one!
You're a drinker?
What are you reading?
I think you're swimming better than me.
Tom killed a man with a knife.
What's your friend's name?
I answered it.
"The kids love Halloween."
It's hard to speak French.
He said he wanted to learn French.
Is there anything we can do?
That needs to be fixed.
You are the teachers.
Mary's been hurt.
His name is Tom.
She's thirsty.
We had a great time in Boston.
Don't make it!
Don't watch it.
Tom's happy.
Chuck Norris was born in a house he built.
I have a very heavy internet connection.
The night has just come in.
I'll buy you something to eat.
Ready to fly.
"How long have you been here?
You're underwhelming.
Get up on you!
"Could you pass me the salt, please?"
I want you.
It's not going to last forever. Coffee is smothering. Smoke is shrinking. Time goes by with people changing.
You're very good!
"Are you asleep a little?
I didn't feel like I was hungry.
Am I Wrong?
Do you like to lose it?
Theblem?
Tom wants to get back to me.
It's going to rain tonight.
I just got out of school.
I don't miss you on this.
What's the name of the song?
Who's been helping out?
Stay away from it!
Hello, my name is Tom. How do they say you?
Would you like to stay longer?
I'll be staying in Boston until October.
He felt like he was Tom.
He didn't care who he was looking at.
He could rest as much as he wanted.
Go where you're going!
You've changed your clothes!
You've got to see this.
Stay where you're going!
I can't read without books.
I don't like swimming in the ocean.
"Do you hear me now?
God doesn't see us.
You don't sleep too much.
We are trying to help you.
You know he likes beer.
I'm glad you were there.
"Where are you going today?
It looks like you're from Japan.
He said he left his keys at home.
"Did you stop Tom?"
No one is a cat.
What did you think of Tom?
"Open your mouth!
I'd like to try.
I'll show you how it's done.
My words are the truth of my life.
If I were you, I'd go home and get some rest.
I don't need your regrets.
He doesn't seem to eat much.
They're not doubtful.
You're all adorable.
Sam wanted to know where he was going.
You're laughing.

"Your parents love me very much.
"How much is Kyoto?"
Don't pause here.
Are you waiting for someone?
Have you ever played with a friend?
I didn't know you didn't know how to do it.
He's the only one who needs to know that.
No one can do them!
I'm really looking forward to Paris.
If I had been in London, I would have been there.
I need to learn how to take care of myself.
We hated them all.
Have you ever had a meal?
It wasn't long before he died.
What are you going to do on Halloween?
Don't give up!
"That's your slave, isn't it?"
When did it start?
She took it.
Let me explain it to him.
I can't decide if I'm going to stay or not.
Mary knew exactly what she wanted.
Try to pick up a dog, cat, or cat.
"I know you're here.
The Mesothelioma is the basis of the struggle for human rights and freedom.
I'm here to see you.
Do you really want to go to Germany?
Sammy was shocked.
He's waiting for someone.
I'm going to have a drink for Mary.
I love you very much.
What if I don't have a question?
Where's my computer?
I'm not your servant!
You can understand French, too.
Take the example of your sister.
You know I can't.
I'm going to talk to you again.
They live outside the city.
The food has arrived.
"Why did you wear a coat?"
The god d.
Somebody's been watching you.
Mary was going to sleep.
How do I get to the train station?
I'm going to help you out.
You have to read that.
Why doesn't anyone believe me?
Who's this ?
I'll buy it for you.
Tom had his brother's.
I will be back tomorrow.
We saw them.
you're hurt?
We've got to do something.
"You speak German very well.
Talk to someone else.
Tell me if there's any change.
They laughed.
Don't make excuses.
Who's been cheating?
He sent me a letter from Australia.
He held his hand when he knocked on the door.
How much are you going to go?
"Why do you want to help me?
Well, I've got another solution.
It's a work.
Who's talking?
What makes you feel bad about me, too.
And he wants more.
Tom's got his shots.
Thank you, I don't drink coffee.
These are my books.
Tom turned around.
Somebody's been calling.
Can't we talk about it in the morning?
You don't need to smoke!
He's coming!
I give you a lot of money every month.
We hate them all.
Hurry up to home.
She's helping him.
Be ready for it!
I don't think anyone has seen you do that.
Somebody's killed Tom.
Tom and Mary don't want to go to Boston.
He bought a drink for everyone in the restaurant.
Why do you want to say all that?
He's not a good writer.
No one can forgive them.
"Tell me about your job.
Look for someone else.
He's dead?
"Who remembers?
Let's dance!
He didn't like Tom.
Tom didn't quite understand it.
Somebody's been killed.
I love the pics.
He wants to see Mary.
So, what are you talking about?
Somebody took my place.
Sam picked up a piece of wood from his neck.
Do you remember what he said?
Zwirr.
He was married for money.
What did you see?
Tom's brother is a friend.
Have you ever been to Australia?
He didn't see Mary.
I know you're an idiot.
"Are you crazy?
Who's been banned?
"Break your hands with blood.
There's somebody?
There's nothing left in the shower.
"Tell him tomorrow.
I've heard someone scream.
Who's got it wrong?
He wakes up early.
Please tell me how I can help you.

I feel for someone.
Tom and Mary don't have anything to eat.

"What brought you here?
They're all waiting.
Can you tell me what he did?
I'd like to see who called.
"Please say hello to your parents."
I'm not afraid of death.
THANK YOU for your help.
Don't you know how to kill it?
She shrugged, "I'm not going to go, I'm going to go."
My mother was sick for two days.
There's something you're hiding.
Split up so you can feel good.
I'll tell you what I did last year.
The company has announced that it is not looking forward to the next phase of the project.
It was built by Mary.
Come on, come here.

He kissed me from the tree.
I don't believe in Boston.
Lwennas Mematob and John Lennon of Kabylian.
Don't give up what you asked for.
There was someone who came.
I don't think Tom would agree with that.
When do you think you're going?
you're talking?
I gave him my car.
You're lying.
But I want more money.
Keep on Free!.
I'm glad to know you.
Someone's got the time.
And he's got a new friend.
Is there anyone who's coming to see us?
Well, I can drive.
"Can you see it?
Fernen.
If you eat it, you will die.
I want someone to talk to.
Somebody's been watching us.
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
I haven't forgotten you all.
I want you to forgive me for everything I said.
You don't like your dog, do you?
Tom, Mary and John are all here.
They're running.
He is scheduled to return on October 20th.
"I heard someone crying.
He hadn't seen Mary since October.
Tom called to Mary.
No one went there.
We were both tired of it.
Can you break my heart in two?
We're embarrased.
The dog is dying.
You're beautiful.
Don't hold on!
I know you have the courage to do this.
It's your word.
"Have you called him yet?"
Those who have never slept have never slept.
Somebody's been looking for you.
You've already answered?
Tom has arrived.
ANSWER my questions.
Someone's been calling you.
He said he was waiting for 30 minutes.
I'm going to try again again.
The dog said to him, "Why don't you get tired of being hungry?" and he said, "I'm tired.
He bought it for Mary.
I was ready for them.
I like to watch.
Someone's trying to kill you.
Who's said that?
I won't do it again.
This is Tom's idea.
No one has ever seen you do that.
There is always a problem in the war.
How much do you put on your shoes?
They're good people.
Just go there.
This girl is mesmerized.
I want to hold your hand.
Get out!
STOP to talk.
This is WRONG.
Where's the nearest bus station?
I'll be back soon.
We will never stop learning.
It's a gift for you.
Get up for you!
She followed Laila until she was ready to go.
Mary's parents are friends of mine.
You've succeeded.
I don't have any other way.

I like this movie.
Read it now.
It was snowing in the snow.

You're all right?
A beer, please.
I'll trust you.
Who's stopping it?
"Just let me go.
"I'm working on Tom.
You've got my mind!
Sam was struggling a lot.
I didn't want to wait that long.
Somebody's got a fire.
Tom has to go to school.
It's still good to go.
Somebody's been seeing us.
No one ate the cart.
I'm saying.
"Have you ever worked with him?"
He doesn't want to go.
He said he could cry.
They all laughed.
"Please call me tonight, please."
Sam was in jail.
We did this on October 20th.
Tom is going to get up.
He knows he trusts you.

I think he's an artist.
You can speak French.
You've got this.
How much you've got?
I'm very much caught.

I'm sure your father is proud of you.
It's difficult.
Just apologies.

You kids should be ashamed of yourself.
He looks just like his father.
As Franz Kafka said, "When you're gone," or perhaps Woody Allen, simply saying, "It's a long, long, long time at the end."
I was so scared when I opened the door.
A cup of tea, please.
I'll call you before I get there.
I can't wait to see your Halloween costumes.
He could do that, couldn't he?
Leave it to us.
I think it would have been better to leave in October.
What's your father's name?
He'd seen him again.
I want to stay in the middle.
So, you're a badass?
I'm not too long.
You need to be careful when you're breaking the law.
tell him again.
It's good today.
My father didn't care.
Can I ask you a question that isn't helpful?
The book is good for you.
I'll tell you how to do that.
You've seen a movie, haven't you?
the world's peace.
I want someone to help me do this.
It's never!
I'm going to Boston next month.
Have you ever been to New York?
That won't happen.
He said I couldn't go in.
Would you like a red or white ribbon?
Somebody's got his umbrella.
Can't you stop crying?
Are you at home?
Don't call my back.
What kind of movies would you like to see?
TRY this.
He's got a man.
I've missed you.
Eat whatever you want.
Tom is missing.
I was in Boston when this happened.
You've read that?
"You're right behind Tom.
It's like it's snowing.
Answer it to be.
I think I'd like to do that.
I love the games with you.
I wanted to get married with Tom.
People like to eat.
I haven't been there since October.
How'd you find me?
"Jonathan came to see you.
I like to learn languages.
They don't even know how to spell Tom's name.

I think you'd do that if you didn't want to.
Can you take a few drinks with me, please?
Well, it's Monday.
Tom, Mary, John and Alice were born on October 20, 2013.
Sami broke down Laila's house.
And you, too.
Talk to someone else.
He stayed here for 5 or 6 months.
Do you have the problem?
Tom and I were having lunch.
Someone's broken my heart.
I'll meet you again.
"Remove your room.
They're always waiting for others.
He came to believe in Mary.
She's dead.
They never said anything about it.
He said he and Mary hadn't seen him.
He said, "I don't care what you say."
You're getting up early.
Are you coming back from Thailand?
"I know Tom isn't dead.
He wants to buy some books.
you're talking.
For what?
He asked Mary to listen to him.
I was reading a book.
Tell me that you're sorry.
I want you to come right away.
Clear your tears.
Rita is a student.
How'd you get your anger?
Thank you for your donation.
I saw one.
WHY do you say that?
I'm talking about Tom.
"Can I have it?
There is no more hope.
I know you need to have the courage to do that.
It's a place where people listen to the sounds of the night, the sounds of the night, the sounds of the night, and the sounds of the night.
Maybe there's something you've seen.
I had coffee with milk.
I hope no one has seen you.
You still don't like it, do you?
He seems to be the one who tells the truth.
"I know you're going to Boston in October.
I'm wearing my clothes.
Why didn't you send me a message?
I love you very much.
Are you sure you know what needs to be done?
Tom is speaking French.
Tom was crying.
"Can you eat?
There's somebody there.
How many tickets did you get?
Oh, what a fool!
"Please stop, please.
A little red wine, please.
He said, "We've got to get sick.
Somebody's got it wrong.
He didn't leave Australia.
"We know it wasn't you who killed Tom.
He's been with Mary for almost an hour.
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.
Speak up!
"I understand Tom.
When you're coming?
The milk is cold.
That's good!
He went to Boston to find a job.
You've got to help your father.
It's been over two years waiting.
I'm glad to see you, too.
"Why are you bothering us, Tom?
Do you want to learn French with Mary?
"Why are you so afraid of dogs?"
Go on behind me.
I've learned French.
These guys are going to be fine.
You've won.
Let's go faster!
Instantly!
Excuse me, where are you from?
What do you want your dog to eat?
The beauty of "Kathy" is Kathleen.
Tom is in Los Angeles.
I hope he didn't tell me to do that.
Who likes you to them?
Look at it here.
He met a lot of other artists while he was in Boston.
This morning, he picked up his car.
I'm going to the Halloween party in a vamper dress.
He stayed here for a while.
"Leave Tom alone.
I want to call Mary.
I can't see her.
Now I see the world differently.
I saw a book.
You've read that?
I don't understand how you feel.
Rhodos is already here.
I don't have a sister.
Tom and Mary wanted to know why they were there.
"You have two faces.
I'm learning art history.
Get out of there!
Maybe we should tell someone else.
He wasn't at all concerned about the fact that he was being bullied.
I'll write to you when I do.
I've been delayed.
I know you've lied to me.
You're going to worry about that.
That's good.
How many people are in India?
She couldn't find Mary.
He writes slowly.
You're testing me!
He kissed me.
Is there anyone who has seen anything?
Believe on me!
You won't stop.
Can you help me to translate this into English?
I want to come with you.
We went to the next station.
Sam called his mother.
Somebody wants to kill me.
She started to feel good about Mary.
Someone's been stealing from me.
Did he tell you anything about it?
Can you help me to translate this into English?
It's already started with Tom.
I'm going to swim with you.
"Please, speak slowly.
"Please come in!
He wanted to kiss Mary.
"There's something Tom said to you.
We apologise.
I've been trying to do better.
"I was reading French when you read it last night.
Get out right now.
She's said.
You don't look like a baby.
He's really hating my ass.
There is no internet connection.
She's selling this car.
Well, you can come in.
Tom helped to help out.
Let go of me.
Somebody's dead.
You've been so stupid?
Give it to me.
I need to talk to someone.
I've got something to give you.
Somebody's been eating them.
Do you understand?
Tom was out of it.
You didn't come into my room without a shower.
I'm pleased with your letter.
I'll show you how it was done.
If you want to leave, go now!
Thank you, I'm still understanding.
They're fat, Tom.
But you're not Japanese.
If she could, she would know.
Don't stop singing.
Don't wait.
Be patient with him.
Choose the flowers that you like.
"Sell me.
Someday someone will be successful.
You've called?
Are you a new one?
Mary would have been able to help us.
Speak.
"Where did I leave my mother?"
It's a good day!
Tom doesn't seem to be happy.
You're OK?
I can't do what I want.
I can't take care of you.
Sam's friend is dead.
"Why did you buy it?
"Please give me the sugar."
Call it the milk.
We've been waiting for them.
We wrote them.
Keep on going.
I need someone to talk to.
You're going to walk fast!
We've got three players.
Afraid of him.
Tom swore to Mary that he wasn't the one who stole his inheritance.
I miss you very much.
I've never said I'm sorry.
Don't speak!
Tom is in the seventh heaven.
They did a lot of things for me.
Wouldn't you rather spend a lot of money on that?
Go again!
Where's the stillness?
I'll tell them about that.
He knew that Mary was following him.
"Hurry up!
This is not Australia.
We haven't found the right solution yet.
I don't understand the three.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth.
Yes, please.
He's gone.

You're calling your country.
Sammy had been drinking from Laila's cups.
You're in love?
I need to talk to someone else.
They were EATING.
He didn't do anything about Tom.
No one has slept.
"You've rejected my advice.
They're all singing.
What else do you want to buy?
But I'm not your friend.
I think he's ready.
Take some rest.
"He really loves you.
They want you dead.
I am a Muslim who believes in Jesus. Is there a problem?
You should always have a dictionary in your hands.
You want to talk to me, don't you?
You have to be brave.
"I can run.
I know who this book is.
There's a little girl on the table.
Do you want to know what you're going to get for your birthday?
You seem to be good.
He's hurrying.
Don't have any questions?
I told them they didn't tell you.
There's something smelling.
Follow in your sister's footsteps.
I've tried too much.
"Stop looking at it!
Tom's room is always nice.
Keep on singing.
You've given me my mind!
I'll be in Australia until October 20th.
LISTEN to this!
We can do that now.
Get ready for it quickly.
I've got to eat now.
I'm not breaking anything.
He gave me a few books.
I'm sorry for your loss.
It's going to wind.
Squeeze them.
Someone's been watching you.
It's a pity you can't come.
Swingmet-as.
He paid Mary <0x24>300.
I don't know who can swim and who can't.
They left yesterday.
He said he had never heard Mary sing.
Nothing has changed.
Let him live as he pleases.
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
I've done that.
Reply if you can.
How did you find out about Tom?
My dad used to call me every three days.
She didn't kiss Mary.
Try to make him feel it.
Do we really need to go back?
They're on the way.
And then I'm alone another day.
Tom had to get some flowers for Mary.
Mary followed him to the house.
Tom will be buried on October 20th.
Tom won't let you go.
Everything has a limit.
Why do people go to the movies?
Why don't you blame me?
I've bought an old car.
Hurts!
No one understands me.
Shu Tom!
Are you an Artist?
You're thinking?
Jesus is Tom.
Tom came out of his dream.
It didn't happen very well.
Go where no one knows you.
I don't like big dogs.
Is there anyone you'd like to know?
I don't use a computer all the time.
Tom can make a meal.
Uraremt!
I want to become a writer.
Let's get it!
He tried to get Mary out of the house.
Tom is an atheist.
If you don't eat much, it's better.
I'm the Kabyle.
There was someone at the house.
I'm not a student.
He said he wanted to stop smoking.
"Someone's just called.
But he didn't see Tom.
What are you waiting for ?
I want someone to help me do this.
Tom and his wife.
The song is well-received.
I like to watch some Western movies.
I can't see so much.
We'll see you tomorrow.
He loved Tom.
You're in Australia?
I hope no one will follow you.
Aren't you ashamed?
Who? We?
Shum!
He always speaks to me in French.
I have a report to write.
I know some of them.
Wouldn't it be better if I took a break?
He didn't want to see her.
I didn't find you on this.
Smile, please.
I'm going to pay.
He tried to swim in the water.
Are you Laughing?
Go on home.
He needs to be careful with his teacher.
Why did they respond to you?
How'd they tell you?
I need to do that today.
All my problems are over.
I sent him home.
I like it.
I heard a man whispering.
I'd like you to close the door when you get out.
Where's the band?
Someone's been watching you.
You don't want me to succeed, do you?
"Did you know him?"
How'd you do?
"Why didn't you call him and remind him?"
Someone's been talking to him.
"Please tell him to come in.
They all love you.
Can I ask you a question if you don't mind?
As the saying goes, a man comes from a tree.
He's not a good witness.
Don't stop me when I'm talking.
Mary had asked for it.
You've done something!
They gave me the books that they gave me.
He went swimming in the river.
I think you should read this book.
Why Are You Afraid?
These are the new ones.
Is there anyone who can help me?
Somebody's watching us.
You're better off if you continue to work in a place like this.
Tom is not dead yet.
That's why we're going to climb a mountain.
Someone's been calling him.
Who's that close?
I'm going to eat now.
I've been bought by Tom.
Tom was terrified of it.
Please tell me something different.
Lost.
Why didn't you tell me you were going to London?
you're talking.
Did you check them?
I was walking with my dog.
I saw a man kissing me.
Maybe we should tell someone else.
The kids of the day are very young.
Please don't be mad at me.
Someone's been calling you.
Now he doesn't know what to do.
Do you have any questions?
Let's go!
Please, please stay on the sidelines.
Shut up!
What's that?
I had understood it.
Don't eat it.
What do you want your dog to eat?
Tom has until October 20th to decide on it.
They got me out of work.
take me home.
You've got to see his movie.
You're all walking.
Mellish.
He was the tallest man in his class.
How's it all going?
She's flowering.
You may have done this to us.
Eat your heart out, John.
He doesn't always tell the truth.
I'm just saying you're trying to get my hair cut.
I came to Australia on the 2nd of October.
I wonder how anyone would want to do that.
He said he wanted to be buried in London.
If you continue to work in a place like this.
I've been robbed of my money.
I know he's busy.
Gent.
"What can you give me, Tom?"
I remember doing that, too.
I begged him to come.
He just can't swim.
I'm taking care of her.
Drink the water.
Is there anyone who can help?
LISTEN SOMETHING.
That's what's written, my son.
I'm wondering if he's got a badge or not.
Tom still wants to go with you.
He said he didn't want to sing.
I like it very much.
Thank you for coming to my house.
I was hoping to get back out.
Bring me back to work as long as I love it.
What do you think of his new book?
One of them can stop me.
So, you're Russian?
He said he'd never eaten a chicken.
He said he had a day off.
Friedrich Nietsche was a German philosopher.
Do you know how to remember?
You're all crazy.
"When did Tom come?"
What did you put in the box?
He's become very popular.
I called for security.
you're dancing.
Mary's been hurt.
"This house is small.
We're not ready to ask now.
Get out of here!
Who's got the idea for this?
"I gave him a dog.
Have a coffee.
I hope you will understand.
How'd you find me?
I thought it would solve the problem.
"Where are we going to go, Kathleen?" he asked.
Computers are installed.
I'm not afraid of anything.
I'm not trying to stop you.
I want to know everything you've done.
Is there anything that has happened?
I think there's something.
"Do you have a dog?
"Can you speak slowly, please?"
Somebody wants to talk to you.
Take it to him!
You're here?
Tom lied to me.
Tom and Mary aren't in Australia.
I didn't feel sorry for him until he showed up!
He said he wasn't alone.
Take a look at this water.
THANK YOU!
There's someone waiting for you.
I love the light of the candles.
"Do you like Italian?"
"Did you find your letters?"
I don't love you no more.
"I saw a dog.
What's the name of this fruit?
What's my prize?
I won't forget all that.
I just hope no one sees you here.
I'm sorry...
When did you start doing that?
I'm going to quit the job.
Finished.
"I'm going to have to speak French," he said.
He couldn't finish his dinner.
Go back to back.
He told me that Mary wasn't dead.
He wrote a letter to Mary.
I just can't do it anymore.
James is a gentleman.
A cup of tea, please.
Do you speak French.
Let me know if there's anything that's changed.
Get away from me!
"Have you seen him yet?"
They're going to play football tomorrow.
Wa John.
Oh, how strong you are!
Tom nodded.
Go on ahead.
There were two things that happened that didn't happen.
You don't like your dog, do you?
It's coming on Monday, and it's coming on Sunday.
I'll be in Boston in October.
"Did you see the smile?
Do you remember me?
You were right.
You're talking too fast.
You're Hungry?
Is there anyone who's come?
Well, come here.
He was drinking until he got drunk last night.
I've lost my job.
He likes the art.
There's someone watching.
You've never told me that you know me.
It's coming on Monday after Sunday.
I'm not your servant!
Why didn't he want to stay?
What's your name on Skype?
Someone's broken his neck.
Uraret!
Get on your feet!
It's not expensive to eat in the restaurant.
I'm almost living.
"I hate to lose.
Shu-t.
You're sick.
You've got to write a novel.
They're going to get screwed.
I understand.
"Who went with you?
the same people who know each other.
Take care of that.
Help me to.
You'd better cut off your hair.
Tom was married to Mary.
We've picked up on the raft.
You're sure you know what you need to do.
I'm going to stay in London now.
She went home to Mary.
He's been reading my books.
You're lying.
"Mary and I are coming back.
I wonder if you like me so much, or if I just love you.
It snows all over the city.
"Give me all the money.
We found him alive.
Where you've been?
The one who opened my eyes shuts my eyes.
Someone would like to send a letter.
"Did you see his face?
I want you to participate.
You'll find someone.
You're a feminist.
I was ready for them.
"Are you wrong, Tom?"
You can drive if you want to.
They're joking.
Read it!
You've woken me up.
Somebody's got to do something.
I want to eat something.
He's used to drinking beer.
It smells so bad.
"Did you eat last night?"
Don't let them come here.
I think he needs someone to help him.
You've come back.
He said he had never eaten anything.
Somebody's been singing.
She's coming?
We need to be stopped by someone.
They've sent you away.
I'm going to study in my country.
"Someone can see us.
I don't miss all of Boston.
"These books are yours or mine?"
She didn't think she loved him.
That's all you need.
"Bring me my bags.
Stop it!
Take these.
He just sent me an e-mail.
Choose it very quickly.
You can go home now.
You're behind me.
I forgot to eat my dog.
You're in the kitchen.
He's freaked out!
I live in Erevan.
there's nothing here.
I know you're going to do it.
He can swim.
Don't be afraid to dance.
They agreed.
Don't stop crying!
There's someone who's been watching Tom.
"Get your clothes on!
He's holding my hand.
Do you want to swim in the winter?
I'll never forget Mary.
Don't forget to say hello to your family.
You're lying.
They've helped.
I miss him, Mary.
Mortals
You can read this book.
I asked him to come with me, and he agreed.
Afraid of you?
I'm going to let Tom kiss me.
Let the water run.
You've been to the United States?
You don't know what true love is.
They're looking for you.
Go ahead and take a shower.
Get up on you!
Tom is playing the guitar.
It's a good idea to have a picnic and it's scary too.
Somebody was listening to it.
Have you seen the new movie?
I'll be going to Paris tomorrow.
Get out of the way!
That's your fingers?
"Who's going to get us?
That's all it is.
"You're lying?
Tom is thinking.
The reading enhances the understanding.
You may have to stop.
Have you ever been to New York?
He said he was afraid of Mary.
You've found us.
Do you think it's going to be a good place?
Help those who are in need.
Is there anything that can't be done?
He doesn't look like his brother.
Keep your eyes on them behind you.
Open the cab with this key.
I didn't leave her alone.
What's a computer?
Why do you want a horse?
It's famous?
Did you know Mary before you went to the club?
Get to know yourself!
Somebody's broken your neck.
No one went there.
Tom and I are just friends.
You're lying to me?
The book can't read for itself.
Please teach me how to write in french.
I told him I didn't want to do that.
Tom and I will always be friends.
That's French?
She's calling.
Oh, how good it is!
Would you like to have some food?
I really love you .
Let's get you out of here.
Try to keep it up.
One for you and me.
He's talked a lot about you.
I'm tired of reading.
How many books have you read?
That's the story.
Tom was shocked.
"How much time?
Somebody's singing.
"Open your mouth!
How'd you spend your time in Boston?
Where'd you leave them?
Sex with the TV.
"Do you need food?"
Make yourself at home.
You can't see where the card is hidden.
Get to know them.
There was silence in the forest.
I can eat when I want to.
One day, Tom and I were born.
Mr. Tanaka called when you weren't here.
"Your parents are still here?"
I just can't sleep.
Sixf.
They're all happy.
We're talking.
Tom nodded to Mary.
I made a big mistake.
He was sitting next to Mary.
Tell me the story of the books.
He speaks 10 different languages.
Sam didn't play this game.
He built a big house.
He thought he was better than all of them.
I'm always proud of you.
I can't speak any other language.
He's never had a problem with anyone.
Hello, all of you.
He didn't know that Mary had done it.
He is a man with many dreams.
Tom was infuriated.
Sammy was just writing.
Why don't you pay attention?
All of the students in the class are looking for a new way of teaching.
He doesn't know how to work with people.
Call me when you get here.
Why didn't you ask someone else to do that?
I have lots of food.
The snow is getting snowy.
Tom had changed.
It was Tom's face.
But you still don't understand.
Take care of yourself!
The day will come soon.
The Holidays.
Your body is a feather.
How do you think about the weekend so far?
They've got another.
Tom saw Mary at the Halloween party.
Get up on you!
I'd like to see my sister.
I married him to Mary.
He died on October 20, 2013.
Tom's scared of me.
Tom is going to Australia.
"Can you give me a little money?"
You're a good writer.
Dillonen.
She sings Julia.
That's an arcade!
Is There Any One?
Sam was trapped in a small town.
He didn't do what he wanted to do.
Someone's seen you.
You're so different from us.
you love me!
Go back on!
Those who refuse to grow will not grow.
Sakaki has come to see you.
He started reading at that moment.
Is there's a problem?
Tom didn't agree.
Do you watch TV every day?
I like to play.
"Please do it slowly.
"Can you come?
I'll do my best for you.
If anyone wants to get his or her head and his or her hair cut off, it's not necessary for anyone to pick it up. If they want it, they're on their way. If they want it, they're going to take it away. If they want it, they're going to give it to you. If they want it, they're going to give it to you.
I'm reading the book.
I need you to do something for me.
You're going to leave me?
He said he had to take the money.
Take a look now.
He told me that I was beautiful.
You are at home.
You've gone to them.
So who's it?
Can I have a cup of coffee, please?
Please give it back.
The room has a capacity of 5,000 people.
The East Coast has paved the way.
Tom's father left his family.
Is there anyone who's been calling you?
It's the wind today, isn't it?
I don't want to wait that long.
I'm very happy to meet you here.
I'm not going to Boston until October.
You've already answered?
You kissed?
I told him he had to do it.
"Can I say something?
We may need them.
So, who's the truth?
Somebody's been calling.
Do you make a meal for him?
Who do you think you're looking at?
Is there anyone who can help me?
"I gave him the money for a lot of money.
"Seal me!
There's someone waiting for you.
The cow is a big cow.
"Do you like Italian?"
I'd like to see you another way.
The march.
Let's try it again!
You're going to get another one, as the first one says.
There was a fire in the house.
I told him why I wasn't there.
He looked at Mary.
Today is the 2nd day of October.
He said he could help us do that.
Who's going to like them?
When did you come to Boston?
He asked, "Why didn't you come to the party?"
I've come alone.
He asked why he didn't come to the party.
They're new?
You are my only hope.
Don't hold on!
Take care of yourself.
He said Mary wasn't too scared.
They made the bread of France.
I've never needed that kind of money.
They've waited.
You need to talk to me.
Tom went back to the park and watched from there.
He told me he wasn't going to say he wasn't going to.
I need to talk to someone.
Are you joking?
You'll be happy if you continue to work in this area.
"You're poor?
I will be back in Boston on October 20th.
You're too tall for me.
I felt very happy about it.
"When did you get your car?"
You've got that.
Tom nodded.
What do you say to your friends?
How'd you get to Australia?
Who did you see in the movie "Breakfast"?
Tom and I were on the same train.
I love my cat's tongue.
There's somebody?
Can you speak French as well?
You're used.
Tom is a very good writer.
He's playing piano all the time.
He doesn't need to go to school today.
'Cause you're a girl.
Somebody's already been there.
Sicily is an island.
People are changing.
I don't want to leave you.
"Can you watch here?"
You can use this dictionary.
I like the coffee.
She likes to play tennis, but she doesn't.
Tom is going to Australia.
Tom is a good man.
He was laughing at Mary.
Let's dance!
I'm afraid we'll have to go home before it gets dark.
They're still following us.
<0xE1><0xB8><0xA4>ader!
We're all sorry for you.
Now you can go home.
Oh, thank God.
That's not my idea, it's not yours.
I'll get you out of there.
"Everybody came to Australia.
All the lights are on, so that the light can be seen in the dark.
Somebody's eating.
I thought someone had died.
What's the report?
No one's ever been listening.
Who's screaming?
I've been ignoring Mary.
Do you want to lose weight?
He dances, Tom.
He promised to come back soon.
You idiots!
It took me a lot of time.
It will be over.
Don't call the shot!
"Stay here until Tom arrives."
Tom's the truth.
Please don't leave me here.
You don't know who we're going to meet.
Do you remember what he said?
"Show me your papers!"
"How long have you been in Boston?"
There's someone outside.
I don't like Boston.
"My doctor is very nice.
I told him why I went to the hospital.
"Go and call.
I love the Miles.
Somebody's been waiting.
I'm glad to see you again.
Naomi turned her head from one side to the other.
You're getting closer.
I'm his brother's friend.
He didn't want to help Mary.
Why did you come to me?
Hello to all of you.
I'm not different.
That's your book?
We're happy we are.
They lied.
Tom is silent.
They still have bread. Do you want anything?
Where I'm from, where you're from.
Tom's appointment will be on October 20th.
Birds are sowing in the spring.
Somebody's got their umbrella.
Take a look at this car.
It's all a movie and a movie.
You've heard it, haven't you?
He's not laughing at me.
Is there anything that's changed?
I'm going to go out and get something to eat.
Is it possible to change the world?
Tom was tired of it.
Tom's got it again.
They picked up the pieces and went straight to the market.
I'll never forget the day I met you.
I play the piano.
What do you want to know about my work?
"You're all alone.
I heard someone talking to me.
"Please bring me some milk for my coffee."
He believes everything I say.
She wants it.
When are you going to eat?
You're getting married?
I think I'm just tired.
You are a good student.
Please, please tell me about it again.
He had a drink for everyone at the bar.
Hi there, beautiful.
Please come in, please.
"Did you see my sister?
"Did anyone tell him?
I want someone to talk to.
"Why are you telling me these words don't make sense?"
It's better red.
You can get your money back if you want.
"You've got a lot of courage.
Don't look at two of them.
When I was in Boston, I was 30 years old.
I'm waiting for someone.
Make that up.
Aha-san,i mean y-id.
I made a promise that I wouldn't go back there.
What do you think is missing?
It may have hurt someone else.
Sam's phone number came back.
We need somebody.
You're lying, I'm not.
The book is very expensive.
"Where's your son?
He is expected to return in October.
Mary was saved by him.
I think he needs someone to help him.
"Did you see the Queen?
It's not Tom's book.
I don't know who you want to know.
Fulfill your dreams.
I was talking to Mary last night.
There may be other reasons.
Someone's been stealing my food.
Let go!
They all agreed.
Be strong!
Just take a look at my new car.
But it's still hot.
My son went to Japan.
Have you ever talked to me in French?
Do you want to give it to Tom?
They're always looking out for others.
"Where is God now?"
Sam was starting to freak out.
He likes to read.
A house!
He shouted at Mary.
Tom and Mary aren't in Australia.
He called his sister.
And God knows it.
We talked.
"Are you Tom?"
No one understands you.
He likes to sing.
I'm hoping someone will do it now.
Maybe he'll be able to help you out on Sunday.
The dog is asleep.
You've got to get used to it.
All of my friends have one.
In any case, this virus may have been caused by Covid-19, because we didn't build it, it's gone viral.
I've been coming from Australia.
Get out now.
Look at the way.
You've told them a story.
You can talk, can't you?
Do you know a man named Green?
Ddret!
He's got something for Mary.
No one understands the meaning of Amar.
You've read that?
You've found them.
"Call me tomorrow.
The bird can't fly.
Wait for him.
Choose with your own mind.
It's white?
Is it true that God is calling Muslims to kill non-Muslims?
She's got a coach.
I think he might have seen something.
Who's going to run?
Tom seems to be scared.
Tom lied to me.
"Where were you this morning?"
Can you see it?
Can you give me a piece of bread for medley, ania, piotr and lech?
He killed someone else.
I'm not lying, you're lying.
Did you get a little sleep?
I love the art.
I'm not your love.
Be a good one!
I'll show you a few people who speak German.
Take good care of your journeys.
I'm so happy for you both.
They're all speaking French.
Well, you know yourself!
It's my little garden.
He'd found them.
This is not enough.
You've got Tom.
Don't care about him.
He bought a cat.
What'd you read to him?
Are you coming back from South Africa?
"What did you say to Tom?
He was dressed in Halloween costumes for the school.
They all died.
Have you been waiting for someone?
Somebody's watching.
The woman said to him, "Let me go of the woods, I will leave you alone."
He was born in prison.
He started work on October 20th.
We've been waiting for them.
Don't say to anyone.
You've spoken.
Somebody's got the time.
"Open your books!"
I think I'll start with a beer.
Tom knew that Mary had gone to Boston.
It's your clothes!
There's nothing in his place.
It's empty cavity.
He'll come tomorrow.
James is jealous of it.
I don't think he speaks French all the time.
Take care of yourself.
Get up early and find your place.
What are you doin'?
Somebody's already done that.
Do it now.
"Did you eat lunch?"
Do you remember what he said?
I can't wait to see your Halloween costume.
I'm not crying anything.
You're too tall for him.
Thank you for your post.
In order to learn the language, you need to learn the language.
Come on!
Who's listening?
Mary and Tom didn't want to be together.
Someone's been stealing my money.
I was surprised to see you.
She helped him.
Tom was relieved.
"Stay with me.
Please respond to it.
Every morning, I ask myself why.
I'm watching the TV...
Somebody's got to do something.
Are you finished with your work?
Can you leave us alone for a minute, please?
You're lying.
He's got his head full of problems.
I'm not the right or the left. I'm the right person.
She already knows the answer.
What do you like? What do you not like?
You've got yours?
Where are we going? What do you think?
Where's your son's son?
I'm going to follow Mary.
Well, then!
Try to find the cure.
Let go of me!
He's already on the bus.
You don't look like a baby.
"Can I go home now?"
He nodded his head at Tom.
"When are you coming to Algeria?"
I heard him get angry, but he didn't talk to his brother.
You're lying.
He doesn't believe me again.
What works in one language may not be the same in the other.
Is there anyone who's been hurt?
It's snowing.
I like to eat out.
Someone's been stealing from me.
Tom is back.
We've found Mary.
Who is the author of this book?
Tongue is a beautiful language, which produces music with an open mind.
That's Tom's car.
I've been thinking a lot about Mary.
Are you sure you can go without saying goodbye?
Tofu is very good at it again.
"Why would you think that?
He introduced Mary to the devil's school.
Tom is up.
He might have come.
How do you like a girl who doesn't love her?
Most of the water comes from the water.
Do you think I'm beautiful?
Someone's been stealing my food.
Sam was sitting in a chair.
Tom and I are together.
You've got the courage!
I wish I could be alone.
I won't wash my car.
"She's seen him beautiful for a long time.
You can change it if you want to.
Don't lie to me.
He is a true prophet, isn't he?
Who's in there?
You've gone crazy?
Tom's time is not too late.
He's lost everything to Tom.
Water, please, please.
I need someone to talk to.
He wanted to talk to the people.
I was just joking with it.
I don't like to play baseball.
I'm leaving work in October.
They have a lot of money.
Tell it to everyone.
Do you have a problem?
Tom is dying.
He was spotted on October 20 in Boston.
Tom is a genius.
I'm glad to see you again.
Don't stop the sarcasm.
I love the games with you.
I felt like someone was cheating on me.
She loves her.
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
Someone told him the truth.
I can teach you how to cook.
Where do you want to eat?
He's got to do it again.
"He's my real friend Tom.
It's snowing.
Mary was an accomplice.
Alice was sleeping in her room.
"He called Tom.
Help! Help!
Do you think it's good for this dress?
Smile.
You're it.
Is there anyone else in there?
Tom cheated Mary.
Please call him, please.
Leah and I have been fighting each day.
Would you like to read something?
I opened the door for him.
Is there anyone you want to read?
Tom was wearing a halloween crown.
I think she's going to get out.
I need to learn how to take care of myself.
We all know how to speak French.
He plays the guitar very well.
Do you want to talk to your wife in Spanish?
He married his sister.
Someone's following us.
There's always someone there.
Do you think you'll get him?
I've sent you a few messages.
Who's the owner of this car?
I don't think I'll be today tomorrow.
You can't drive.
There's someone sleeping here.
You've already paid.
Australia was the only country I saw last year.
It's really amazing.
"There's something Tom told you.
Is there anything you want?
"Show me your papers!"
Now, go and change your clothes.
It's already October.
Ah, the screams!
We are brothers.
Be good to all people.
"Who can open the door, please?"
I'm living in Azerbaijan.
So, what did you do today?
"Are you crazy?
I'm mad for you.
My husband calls me every three days.
This book is heavy.
Do you think I'm beautiful?
You're dead?
He said we'll have to wait here.
Leave it to us.
I'm sorry they didn't try it.
I'm so happy for you both.
Tom went to Mary's.
Choose one of them.
It's your time!
She's talking.
You're a Canadian?
You guys! You want to put down the key! I didn't see it!
Mary's going to help her.
No one can do you!
There are plants that are very cold.
I've been singing for a while.
I was walking by the lake.
You can have whatever you want.
She's here!
Speak to your teachers.
Tom is a well-respected man.
Let each man have his own faith.
"I know Tom's secret.
You're excited?
The art is dead.
You're not your friends, are you?
he smiled.
This is for you.
"You're a man?
Are you happy with that?
I've called for help.
You like to dance.
I believe in Mary.
It's clean.
"He's a man who's sick or has been raped," he said.
Well, I think so.
You'll be amazed at what he's drinking when he's out.
Are you waiting for someone?
you're mad?
Please, please, forget about this.
I think he's busy this morning.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Follow me.
Take it easy, Tom. You're good.
I'd like you to know that.
Someone had stolen it from me.
Do you want to eat it all?
He died on October 20, 2013.
Sam is scared as well.
Take a look at it!
Are you going to swim?
Someone's been stealing my food.
Forget it.
Are you going to sell your house?
I love the games.
I don't want to tell you what happened.
Check it out.
Tom is moving to Australia.
Mary's response was a surprise.
"You know the truth.
I didn't recognize him.
I won't do that either.
He was jealous of Mary.
The bad is good?
He's going to kill me.
No one has sent me a letter.
I've got an idea of that.
I can't take care of you.
They're still here?
"Who went with you?
He wanted to make a lot of money quickly.
nothing has changed.
"I have to meet Tom.
I've got something.
I'm going to take Tom's place.
That's a piece of paper?
I'm at home.
You can go home now.
"Where are your sisters?"
I didn't really do what he told me to do.
Today, it's a mess!
They all pay for themselves.
used to say it.
Somebody's going to pay.
Continue to write.
I don't need your help.
Have you eaten the children?
He's crying.
"Why do you need a sword?"
He currently lives in Australia.
I'm a freelance.
It's the wind.
Tom and Mary are having a good laugh.
Tom is asleep.
How can you get away with a guy like that?
Where I'm from, where you're from.
Tom's got caught up.
Is it legal to live in Australia?
Somebody's paying for it.
I've forgotten how beautiful it is.
We need to find someone who can help us.
He was on the fast track.
He's tired.
She likes to catch fish.
Someone's been waiting for Tom.
I can't grow up.
We were both tired of it.
The spring has come.
Is there anyone you want to see?
Tom took the keys to Mary's car because she was drunk.
"You can't drink here.
He's got a car!
Leah and I have been together for a few years.
The two of them kissed him.
I Agreed.
His ideas are bigger than yours.
Get up!
"I hate computers.
Tom gave him a cup of coffee for Mary.
It was his idea.
Listen to Sophia.
you're finished?
She'd stopped it.
Where's the party?
HELP us.
Sam didn't see me at all.
We've got a new one.
Whoa, whoa!
Where did you learn French?
He was reading a book.
There's someone eating.
Can you give me a minute with you?
Leah was a bad girl.
You can't show anything.
Mary has come in.
Don't complain to me!
He couldn't solve the problem on his own.
She doesn't know who Laila is.
How many books do you have?
You are fools.
Nothing has happened.
He paused.
You keep on reading.
He went to Spain.
I asked for 40 minutes.
Where's your son?
Tom's been complaining.
They didn't say anything.
Somebody's got a problem.
Shut up, please!
You've got to eat something.
That's a starve, not a star. And you're a boss.
I'm reading books.
Forget Tom!
"You're afraid of Tom.
I ate it.
Come on home.
Asked by Alex.
I like to swim.
Kiss me!.
I don't agree with your mistakes.
Tom is going to Mary.
How much can you pay for it?
Why Are You Afraid?
You're afraid to fly.
That's what she had when she was with Mary.
Come into my room.
I have to do that now.
Let the water run.
Well, we're in the spring.
The contract expires on October 20.
Did you check it?
"Daddy, give me a hug!"
Help us to us.
I was surprised to see you.
You're still running.
Do you think Australia has a good reputation?
I don't think Tom did.
The wind was blowing against him.
He's old.
I left Australia on October 20th.
"Did you eat your eggs?"
I can see what you're reading.
He's afraid of his father.
Let go of me!
Hi, I'm Nancy.
I ran away.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
I'm going to get dressed tomorrow.
They didn't even know how to spell Tom's name.
Fernet!
I don't usually go to Boston.
Sam didn't stop.
You're scared.
You are a problem.
James was jealous of him.
"Did anyone see anything?
Someone's been calling you.
I need someone to help me.
"Wait, you're getting old, it's not going to come soon.
"You're Chinese?
They met in Boston in October.
Uli Rohde, a beautiful German woman, sings a love song in Kabylie.
"Did you put it all in there?"
Somebody's got to do that.
Latin is a dead language.
He's the only one who needs to know that.
You're Welcome.
How do you feel about yourself?
You seem to be sick.
Of course, I will do that.
Tom and Mary seemed to be the best of friends.
It's never.
You want to talk to me, don't you?
I've got money.
I love her, she loves me.
Lana finally went to the party.
Love is going to make you blind.
You've been very lucky!
We know.
I know her.
Tom has been stolen.
A black cat eats a white cat.
I'm going to go.
Let's get your clothes on!
Somebody's been tired.
She bought a bottle of water.
Called.
We'll ask for something else.
You're mad?
Which team do you like?
Take the example of your sister.
He came close to my house.
But you still don't understand.
It's dinner!
I asked him to come out right away.
You can't go to Mary.
Can you show me a picture, please?
Sami was there to protect his family.
You're lying to me?
It's Japanese?
"Did you see anything?
"I need you here tomorrow."
I'm waiting for Mary.
Tom seems to be upset.
Tom nodded his head.
The god d.
He's back from Australia.
Forget Tom.
We are talking about Australia.
He said he couldn't eat any more.
He's not a boy.
Somebody's already done that.
I don't want to live with you.
I speak a little French.
He told Mary that he was thirsty.
I've been to a lot of Asian countries.
My garden is a small one.
I will die for you.
Your job is done with just one piece of paper.
Wwet Tom.
Our work is just one piece of work.
By Uber.
It's not Tom's book.
I'd like to eat with you.
Get some rest.
Give it to whomever you want.
"Can you watch Tom?"
"What did your mother say?"
Tom's wife is Canadian.
I'm going to eat the beans.
You're not laughing.
He wants to marry me.
I didn't sleep until the sun came up.
He thought that one day he'd come back from the dead.
She knows how to live.
I was very upset in October.
"Can you help me, please?"
Come and relax, please.
Sam is a very difficult person.
The teacher was looking for me.
"Please, I want this book.
I like the laughs.
I'm a human.
It's our turn!
Could this have happened in the United States?
"Call him Tom.
There are only three months to come in October.
You're happy.
It's merciless.
"Don't kid me, Tom.
I'm not the one who cheats.
I was married to you.
What's in it if someone sees it?
The one who is looking to find.
There's nothing you can do to help.
Sami knows his secrets.
Just let me see him.
"I don't know why I'm laughing.
It looks good.
I'm not your servant!
You're drinking too much?
There's someone who came.
It's the word that comes out, it's the word.
"You're still in school?
You're a bit of a worry.
Someone wanted to help you.
Let's talk about this issue in the third place.
"My name is Jack.
Don't call us.
He couldn't run away.
He wanted to make a lot of money.
They paved the way.
I'd better tell him.
If you don't want to do it, don't do it!
The patient was seriously ill, and the doctors were waiting for him.
Oh, what's happened!
I like to write in my own language.
I hate to work.
Leave it to you!
"Save yourself!
He won't find him.
Don't you have to go in tomorrow?
There is no Nobel Prize in Mathematics.
Please, please, please!
I want to know everything you've done.
Let me know if I'm going to make a quilt.
"Did you see your table?
He said he would come tomorrow.
I'm sorry for your success.
I'll see you in October.
I got married to a brother.
I don't need to leave this place if I don't have anything.
Squeeze yourself.
I forgot about your number.
you're sleeping?
I'm starting a new life.
I've been thinking about you.
I like to eat pizza.
Those who are able to climb the mountains will be able to climb the mountains.
He was talking about Mary.
No one knows why.
We've just finished the meal.
Are you Afraid?
Don't go away!
Take care of yourself.
Somebody's been sleeping in there.
"You'll understand Tom.
We only did it once.
"I know French.
You have a Fever.
Are you happy with that?
You don't have to feel that way.
Someone's been calling you.
I'd like to surprise everyone.
"Did you find the umbrella?"
Open up your book.
See you later, mother.
He said he had a day off.
Oh my god!
You are a good student.
Somebody's broken the wall.
I'm going to talk to you again.
I'm not going to be alone.
Look for someone else.
Tom started to laugh.
What type of writer do you like?
"I know Tom.
"Let her go.
She built it.
Do you want to tell him?
Who's that close to?
I'll try to help you.
No one is listening.
I want to learn to inspire.
I'm asking you to help me.
No one does not care.
Who am I talking to?
I'm going to like Tom.
Oh, my brothers!
I want a new dress.
He likes a good party.
This is coming from Australia.
He's quit smoking.
Somebody's got to stop him.
Duggle.
What kind of girl do you like?
It's your day!
Trying to keep up with Tom.
Why didn't you take her home?
It's crazy.
Did you give him a gift for his birthday?
Construction is expected to start in October.
Tom's got it at times.
Do you know how to play?
You're sick?
Listen-d!
Don't speak!
Just like I see you.
There's nothing.
Have you ever had a bad day?
The day is going on.
You've got a rosy?
He LOVES himself.
He asked me why I didn't do it again.
He paid for Tom.
Tom's going to be a little slow.
"How much bread did you eat?"
The boy is clean.
It's hard to be French.
I think there was someone in the room.
It's finally snowing.
He refused to believe her.
Who's that close?
You're married in the woods.
I'm very happy for you.
I need the TRUTH.
"This house is very small.
And don't forget your money.
Have a good rest of the day.
Tom is very smart.
Someone was looking at it.
Sell him.
It might be true.
Every question has an answer.
He'll show you how to do it if you ask.
Don't stop tossing!
How many of us will be there?
A friend of mine called me last night.
He ran outside to see what had happened.
"I saw a man kissing me.
Well, you can read this book.
He loves you, Tom.
You've got to watch your move.
Is there anyone here or has been there.
"You're here alone?
Keep your eyes on.
Who's said that?
It's good for you.
We did what we had.
I don't want to buy them anything to drink.
I haven't said anything yet.
It's my job to teach English.
Tell them I'm here.
I think he ate his paper.
I need someone to help me.
I had to tell the truth.
Leah heard the sound outside the door.
When he was young, he found Sammy.
Do you and your family understand French?
You're at home?
Where did you come from?
I'm waiting for someone.
They'll do as I told them.
"I don't want Tom here.
Who's said that?
That's the world?
You're all alone.
My wife has a lot of work.
I don't need to say anything.
No need to smoke.
You've got a very nice smile.
Don't say anything.
But that's not how Tom is.
Why don't we go back home?
I want to be someone to talk to.
I did NOTHING.
Sam saw the video.
I swung to the right.
I remember last year.
Tom's got blood.
Let's dance.
Somebody's got to do that.
Good luck and you'll have a better day!
You can have whatever you want.
Take good care of yourself!
I love you very much.
I'm working on Mary.
It's a gift for you.
Just take me home.
I think he believed that.
Michael Jackson is a writer and I love him very much.
I wanted to kill you.
No one knows who killed him.
Ask!
Don't forget English.
Tom's got some old stuff going on.
No one has heard it.
I'll take those.
You've already paid.
You're missing Tom.
Look to yourself.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth.
Mine is bigger than you.
That's a good car!
I know you're an idiot.
Eat whatever you want to.
What's your favorite game you'd like to play?
Don't forget to say hello to your family.
He was afraid of Mary.
Can I ask you who you are?
Don't forget me.
It's important for teachers to explain everything in a simple way, not just to make it easy for students to go and read their books at home.
Tom didn't drive his car today.
Who's the last one?
Them?
You're the people?
What doesn't make us stronger.
Are you going to be crazy?
Most of the Hollywood movies have a happy ending.
That's all just now.
Who's car is it?
Let's go there.
Is there anyone who's calling the police?
We need to get to know Tom.
Do you watch TV all the time?
We're looking forward to our guests tonight.
Get out of here!
I don't know what to say to him.
If we want to, we can't.
I can ask you to come with me.
"He who does something will come back," he said.
Tom's drink.
Actions!
In truth, to you?
You're drunk?
According to Kabylie Mukayen Ferhun, the OAS culprits in 1962, "Until we have another one to see what we are doing."
I need someone to help me.
He's going to learn French.
I think it's a beautiful place.
Well, come here.
I think Mary and I are tired.
We didn't go to Tom.
"How much time?
Sam didn't need that.
It's the path that leads us to the path that leads us to the right path.
I hope you're scared of him.
He didn't help his father.
I called home.
Religion is more important than God's.
I haven't heard anything.
Don't go away!
I don't eat fish.
I'm eating and drinking.
I thought you'd know.
Check this out.
Leave it all.
I'm not a girl.
"Do you like dogs?"
"Do you like football?"
Champagne, please.
I want you to work with them.
Sam didn't like it.
She tried to give me my address.
Mary's daughter is Mary's daughter.
Who are you waiting for?
I want to know who's coming with us.
Somebody's got to stop you.
I'm worried about Mary.
I just want to tell you that I love you.
Who's your brother?
"You're here alone?
I've known Laila for many years.
Go to the site!
Mine is bigger than yours.
You can kill someone else.
It's beautiful feat.
I don't understand what the teacher said.
I can't believe he kissed me.
I spent a few months in Scotland.
I'm going to eat the beans.
We've tried.
It's your day!
WHY?
There is no idea.
Have you read the book "The Beginning of the Last Temptation"?
Ah, a fool!
"Please, please, call me in.
Are you going to be in Boston next week?
"Did someone call you?"
She can't love you.
He lives in Australia.
He's said a lot of words.
Tom's hair is black.
Don't forget your phone.
It's not a problem!
There's a snake!
"Did you see my sister?"
How do I get rid of the error message in the free version?
"Why are you alone?
It is only through the Word of God that you can understand the Word of God, but it is also through the Word of God that you can understand.
Your father's got a lot.
"You need a good woman.
There's something missing.
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
Some of the stars appear in the sky at night.
Add another cookie.
What are you going to eat for lunch?
What's going on in Boston?
I know he's from Australia.
"Tell him tomorrow.
He didn't want me to sleep.
Why don't you do all that?
"Let Tom go.
He wrote it to Mary.
Mistakes have been made.
Somebody's got to do something.
Quit!
Just talk to them.
I'd like to see your sister.
What do they need to know?
Now I'm going to learn English.
We'll do it again.
I didn't speak French when I was there.
You're going to sleep if you continue to work in a place like this.
What do you want to do?
Thank you, that's all.
She's getting married in October.
Don't you know you can solve this problem yourself?
Is there anyone you'd like to see?
Sam was trying to do good.
Sam was very young.
My parents were born in Boston.
He asked his friend.
The room was all messed up.
He couldn't go to Harvard University.
I don't think you talked to me.
The people were praying for the people.
My father loves to read.
I want to see my son.
He loves his work.
Sam didn't get caught.
"What did your father say?
Open up your eyes.
I'm an aristocrat.
Do you understand?
You've fooled me!
He knows how to play with words.
I'd like you to close the door when you get out.
Open up your window.
He'll be coming tonight.
Tom seems to be tired.
"Sometimes you call me, don't you?"
Let's get him!
"You're a Japanese?
I've added.
Oh, how I miss you!
But I love her.
Tom's a big one.
Can you do more than that?
He took his daughter to school.
It's an exaggeration!
They're trying.
Please, please, please.
start to sing.
He was born on October 20th.
Tell me what I have to do then.
This is for you.
She said she did it for Tom.
You're dressed?
"Show yourself!
He loves both of us.
I want to make her happy.
My father is a doctor.
Tom was hiding out.
He drove his car to the back of the car.
He can speak.
You're all ready.
Why do you want to leave?
It would be better not to do that.
He was born in Boston on October 20th.
"Are you going to come with me tonight?"
They turned him into a squirrel.
Tom did a lot of work for me.
There's someone outside.
You've got a book.
When are you going to leave?
"Are you worried about something?
Checked them?
How many sentences are there in each sentence?
What time do you want to eat?
Somebody's killed Tom.
I think Tom is doubtful.
Stand up and learn.
He cleaned the room.
"Please write it down.
You think I should do that, don't you?
Cannibal Corpse is an American brand of death metal.
There's someone waiting for you.
Mary agrees to it.
The squirrel is passing.
They're gone.
Tamil is my mother tongue.
No one is listening to it.
My body is empty.
He called to Mary.
Our father is an idiot and we're not stupid.
I'll be going next week.
I've heard some things.
Tom is a good person.
He said we need to be patient.
Shumt Tom!
I don't know if you can't sing.
It's none of it!
I know you're kind.
Somebody's been eating us.
I've called my friend.
How much money do teachers have to pay for it?
What do you say?
Tom started to talk.
I don't know where I'm going.
The women like to talk.
I'll put you in your shoes.
I don't think he wants to do that.
Can anyone tell me what's going on here?
I don't know about Tom yet.
There's no joke.
I'm Russian.
Is there anyone you'd like to see?
We'll send someone.
"Did anyone call you?
There's someone waiting for you.
Tom didn't make a fuss.
I haven't been home since October.
I don't like to eat much.
He's got Mary.
Give it back!
He's got your work done.
I didn't eat anything.
I've read.
I didn't know.
You've pissed me off!
I was just like you, too.
Somebody's been calling.
Open up your eyes.
Is there anything that bothers you?
I've been waiting a long time.
Leah was following him in his footsteps, and he was following him.
Somebody's dead.
We doubted him to be a liar.
"Stop it!
Please, please, sit down.
You fell.
You cleaned up your room.
I grew up when I was young.
Tom has been arrested.
Thank you, Sherlock.
Somebody's left their umbrellas.
No one was listening.
I'll talk to you on October 20th.
Can't you eat with us?
You kissed?
Sami got into Laila's car.
I told him I wouldn't go back to the store.
