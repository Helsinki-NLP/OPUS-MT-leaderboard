AMs from Wales are afraid to "be seen as stupid"
There is a consternation among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of Parliament of Wales).
This was raised due to plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliament assembly.
AMs across the political spectrum are worried that this will make them appear ridiculous .
AM Labour said his group was concerned that "this has the same sound as Twp and Pwp."
For readers from outside Wales: In the Welsh language twp means ibleh and pwp means raw.
AM of Plaid said the whole group 'was unhappy and suggested alternatives.
A conservative from Wales said his group had an "open mind" about the name change, but noted that there was a slight verbal difference from MWP to "Muppet".
In this context the letter w in the Welsh language is pronounced similarly to the pronunciation of the letter and.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptor of what should be called the Members of the Assembly will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 empowered the Welsh assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that had broad support for the assembly to be called the Parliament of Wales.
On the issue of the title of AMs, the Commission favoured Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching consensus could be a headache for the presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes within a few weeks' time.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the question of how to be called when they have a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia they leave public opinion in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was set up with the aim of resolving a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plot over the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
But referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the consequence of entry into the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells stop playing as churches in Harlem are sending
"Storically, the elders I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr Adams.
"Today, there is no."
He said that he could understand how the bars disappeared.
He said, "People socialize differently today."
"The bars are no longer the center of local activity where people go on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later they will end up where they were at the beginning."
He added that churches can be replaced with apartment blocks with condominiums filled with the type of people who will not help the rest of the locality sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who buy condoms in this building would be a white carnage," he said, "and thus, they will not be bothered when the day comes when they are opened to these churches because it is likely that many of these people who enter these condoms will not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white-carnations congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of white-carnations - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original Methodist Congregation of people of white carnage left in the 1930s.
A congregation of black carnage people who was practicing the nearby religion took the title for the building.
St. Martin's was taken by a congregation of black carnations under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who ran a retailer's boycott at 125 Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, which resisted hiring or promoting carnations.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson's and successor to St. Martin's, was proud when he called the carillon "the bells of the people."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "cultural treasury" and "a unique historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that she was the first carillon in the world to have had a black carnage musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not change with anyone else.
What happened in St. Martin's over the past few months was a complicated story of architects and contractors, some introduced by the leaders of the lay church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The 'vestry' - the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "will seek to pass on costs" to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in hiring architects and contractors who sent him by the diocese.
Some of the parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy has been injured by a shark in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he huddled for the lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. where Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was staying with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then went over to a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the excitement of catching a lobster, but then "realizes that he was shouting, 'Girl me!
Giddimni!'
"It's all over the place, and it's all over the place," he said, pointing out that he's been there for a while.
"I shouted so that everyone would come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
They took the boy by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack was not known.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said in a media meeting that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with shelves corridors similar to those of a 'department store' of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial entry into the UK beauty market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow as sales of clothing and household goods decline, larger corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and the idea will be more successful.
The investment in beauty came after supermarkets were looking for ways to use the space on shelves that was once used for TVs, microwaves and items for domestic use.
Sainsbury's said it will double the amount of beauty items it is offering up to 3000 items, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space with branded areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are fit for vegans - something that is increasingly being demanded by smaller buyers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will examine concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened at Croydon, in Lower London, last week, while the second opened at Selly-Oak, Birming later this year.
Buying online and switching to shopping with small amounts of food every day at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that shops will increasingly look like ‘department stores’ as the supermarket chain tries to fight shops that are priced at Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has long put Argos's stores in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of Habitats since he bought the two chains two years ago, which he says boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie ended after a fight over how to split pharmacy revenues into its supermarkets.
The new strategy was introduced after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds will play a role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury leather care firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to be suitable for every need and environment that attracts you and the convenient positions of shops mean that we have become a beauty product destination of interest that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones is 'deeply ravaged' after Holly Willoughby cancels <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons character Den Peter Jones 'very angry' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby canceled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks I and Spencer TV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home products and accessories brand, Really.
The pair's business has been compared to the firm of Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop.
This Morning presenter, 37, has appeared on Instagram to announce that she will be leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' character Den Peter Jones very angry because she canceled being part of their business of a life-style firm that makes a lot of money at the last minute - to focus on her big contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "very angry" when the very popular television personality admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his enrome business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, whose new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of time - meant he didn't mean enough.
The business was compared to the firm of Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce she was leaving with True, Jones left Britain and moved to one of his private villains.
A source said: "Truly was by far Holly's first priority.
It was going to be her long-term future that would fill her with the next few decades.
Her decision to leave has left everyone completely amazed.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was almost over.
There is a full store produced at Marlow's headquarters that are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning's presenter, which is among Britain's most profitable personalities, could mean a cost of millions for the company due to a large investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and the potential for its further delay.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
A mother of three, Willoughby and her boyfriend Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby actually settled with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman chairman in March.
The couple travel together and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become an M<0x26>S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity presenter of ITV.
Last night, a source close to Jones said "We do not comment on his economic affairs."
"It's hard to find love, but then we find love"
He joked about criticism he would earn from the news media for making a comment that some people consider "non-presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why do you think President Trump is so out of control?
Trump said in a voice that mimics that of a "news presenter".
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump boasted that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations of denuclearization were halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders on Saturday at the General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "correspondent response" from the United States to the early steps of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, note, the United States is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in the speech of his demonstration.
He said, "We're moving well with North Korea".
"We will go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have a very good relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results - the end of rocket tests, help in the release of hostages and the return of American veterans who had stayed behind at home.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing directly at the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia Destroys Island, Kills Hundreds of People
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they were not needed.
Even after more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to move out of their homes, no national disaster, a prerequisite to catalysing international aid, was declared.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, which is a challenge," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to travel to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign personnel can operate on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman of the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the earthquakes that occur in Indonesia often, the country is still not well prepared for the great anger of nature.
While a shelter from the tsunami was built in Aceh, they are hardly seen along the coast.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite issuing a warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
At the best of times, travel between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make the logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was stationed in Lombok to care for the victims is en route to Palu, but will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made improvements to the falling infrastructure of Indonesia, the center of his election campaign, and spent a lot of money on roads and trains.
But Mr Joko's administration sent out due to lack of funds as he faces his re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from sectarian tensions still in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to move from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the road, using machetes, bows and arrows and other types of weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge equals points in last minute vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a 'goal' in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received the ball from <0x58>herdan Shaqiri while he was 27 metres away from the Chelsea goal with his team losing 1-0.
Hit the ball slightly to his left before firing the ball into the pole.
The ball above much of the box as it finished entered the upper right side of the net.
Eventually, the ball came down behind Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped to try to welcome him, and fell into the net.
"I was trying to get into that position, to get into the ball and players like Shaq always send him forward as much as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming at me and I touched the ball once and I didn't think much about it and I tried to shoot the ball."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 to the middle of the game after bringing a ‘goal’ in the 25th minute by Belgian very good player Eden Hazard.
The Chelsea striker handed the ballum back to Mateo Kovacic, before leaving running towards the middle of the pitch and then quickly entering the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic distributed the ball quickly in the middle of the pitch.
Then he shot the ball very nicely, which led Hazard inside the box.
Hazard ran more than the players in the defence and sent the ball into the net with the left foot and passed through Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool are battling Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday afternoon at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday afternoon in London.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths in Indonesia's tsunami rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
Many people have been reported trapped under the rubble of the building that collapsed due to the 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused high waves up to 20 feet, a spokesman from the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency said in a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was filled with debris from the collapsed building.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was killed with a knife
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found injured by a knife at Grayson Mews in John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who saw or heard something to talk.
Investigative Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages but I appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to everyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have picked up something on dashcam videos to contact us as they may have information that is vital to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to re-enter his apartment but is being informed by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He had no words when he knew what had happened.
Residents are now being informed that they have hours left until they are given permission to re-enter.
A police officer was heard telling one man that the entire area is being considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene with tears in her eyes.
She continues to repeat "it's a terrible thing."
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the enclosed area and another van just outside.
A number of police officers were inside the closed area monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and quote log 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's Parliament statue becomes the last monument affected by the 'rewriting of history' argument
Its removal would be a form of justice appropriate to the destruction in a manner similar to that of the Taliban, of many of the British religious and cultural artefacts carried out by his fanatical ‘Puritan' followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to re-write history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The ‘iconoclasm' of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent portrayal of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of an opinion of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure recognisable for representing one side of that divide.
His achievements as ‘Lord Protector' also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
Killer Swine Attacks and Kills a Chinese Farmer
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with cut artery, covered in blood near a fence in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in ‘hoggery' on 30 May 2005 in <0x58>ining of Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the province near Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin was found dead, and he discovered a door for the pigs' flock near the open.
He said that there was blood in his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had attacked and killed the farmer, according to the report.
"Cousin's feet were bloody and mutilated," said the cousin, who referred to him with his surname "Wu," as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up not to attack others, while police gathered evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking people have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig kept a farmer from Wales with his tractor until the animal expelled his wife.
After a farmer's pigs from Oregon attacked and ate him in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "cause."
"They're playing.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The ruins of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rainfall across the southeastern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves on the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding across northern Mexico and the southeastern United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought an 85 mph wind, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles in a south-western direction of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a ‘trough’ over the Pacific Ocean and is heading east to the U.S. West Coast.As Rosa is approaching the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a United tropical storm will begin to push the strong U.S. tropical humidity into the north.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity interacting with the approaching ‘trough' creates heavy rainfall spread south-east in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially on a large part of Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the diffuse character of the tropical rainfall.
It would not be a good idea to go out into the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause the ‘canyons' to become dangerous rivers and storms will bring very local blowing winds and dust.
The ‘trough' will bring some rain to parts of California's southern coast.
Total rainfall of more than half an inch is possible, which can cause small bursts of debris and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region of their rainy season.
Some scattered rainfall floods begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more scattered late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall spreads in Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October, there may be some strong temperature changes across the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropical areas remain rather warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a big example of dramatic temperature differences from the U.S. Center on Sunday.
There is almost a 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
A large part of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a hot start in October with temperatures in the 80s spreading from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City can go up to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is approximately 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts are indicating high possibilities for above-average temperatures to the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people saw Thursday's highly intriguing testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of committing a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political fight continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with the shocking last-minute news of Friday: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh babasha when he was under the influence of alcohol and tried to remove her clothes when they were a post-secondary school level party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate witness, said he is 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday saw it.
The company was counting the average amount of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen generally finds it difficult to calculate how many viewers there are from offices.
To put this in perspective, it is a size of audience similar to that for the decisive football game or for the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was at the forefront of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was right behind it with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, protesters from CNN and CBS cameras were caught on Friday morning and were shouting at him as he tried to climb the elevator for a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood there staring down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticized, in a live broadcast on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to a country?
They said to him, "You have power when many women have nothing."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator doors were closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcasting networks were broadcasting live, hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate in full for a vote.
But Flake said he would do so only on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee in the following week, which Democratic minorities have been urging.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was powered, because it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "taking advantage of politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "taking advantage" of politics and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May came to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another one-on-one interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack of the so-called ‘Chequers’ Plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s tariffs was a "completion.
Shooting on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson after LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports the CBS affiliate, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said they admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bond was set at <0x24>350,000, reports the Advocate.
East Baton Rouge Parish's coroner's office issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was damage from a head-to-neck gun.
The department is giving credit to the task force of the Louisiana State Police clandestine, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and the area's citizens to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement for "dueness and the pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The striker who was 2 metres long, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 ‘rebounds' per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade told me that the team is "lost" and "under shock" after Wayde's death.
"That's what I worry about all the time," said Wade.
Vulcan throws ash at Mexico city
Ashes being dumped by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern area of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring various sounds and tectonic movements.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash that covered the car windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico City such as <0x58>ochimilco.
Geography physicists noted an increase in activity in the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The well-known "Don Goyo" volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization vote on the secession.
A group in favour of face-covered separatists who were held back by riot police threw them eggs and dust paint, creating a dark cloud of dust on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
There were also minor clashes during the day and the police had to use the lembobs to control the fighting.
Over a period of several hours, pro-independence groups have been struggling "not to forget, not to apologize" against union protesters who were shouting, "Spain Forever."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries they received in the protests, local press reported.
Tensions have remained high in the region that wants independence a year after the October 1 referendum was seen as illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose with a large gap to become independent, although turnout was low with those who are against the secession making a large boycott against the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent fighting.
Pro-independence groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said they had no hope in the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my mother and father crying with joy that they could vote but now we are alone," he said.
Despite having a vital and narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties are sending to maintain this year's momentum with many of their best-known leaders either in exile who decided themselves or in detention and waiting for a role in the declaration because of the process.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone in support of police, said the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"There is more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he will contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"By standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car crashed into a Londonderry home more than once.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Investigative inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
A ‘crossbow' could also have been used to shoot at the car at some point.
Menga's goal to win a 1-0 match for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first 'goal' for Livingston wins game
Livingston, who was promoted, sacked Rangers and so Steven Gerrard lost only a second time in 18 games as coach of Ibrox's 'club'.
Dolly Menga's ball shot made all the difference as Gary Holt's side was tied in points with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has not won a single away from their Premiership field this season and next Sunday they will play against Hearts, who are in first place and behind them with eight points.
Before that game, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna on their pitch in the Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingston continue to have no loss in the division in six matches, with head coach Holt still not losing a game since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against goofy visitors
Holt’s team had long assumed he was winning before he had a ‘goal', with his direct gaming style causing many problems for Rangers..
Scott Robinson managed to pass but passed the ball in front of the bar, then Alan Lithgow was only able to pass the ball with a wide rod after he slipped to get the ball from the headshot from Craig Halkett near the bar.
Those who were playing on their own pitch were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, because they knew that visitors could give them the problems at certain moments.
And that was the way the crucial ‘goal’ came about.
Rangers allowed a ‘free-kick' to enter and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and put it in the bar from the center of the box.
By that moment, Rangers had been dominating possession of the ball, but were finding the defense of the team they were playing on their own pitch, not penetrable, and the ‘goalkeeper' Liam Kelly had little trouble,
That style of play continued even in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to welcome the ball.
Scott Pittman was unable to find a ‘goal’ due to Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow shooting the ball wide after handing out another Livingston player.
Balls were constantly entering Livingston's box and were always removed from their players, while two demands for a 'penalty' - after Halkett's attempt on substitute Glenn Middleton, and another after the ball was touched by a player's hand - were rejected.
'Phänomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Performance and phenomenal result for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
The style of games and their staff has not changed much from returning to the main fight, but the most credit has to go to Holt for the way he has teamed up since he arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
Chief Halkett was very big in his games, organising an incredibly well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall with seven eyes.
However, Rangers had a lack of inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at certain moments under Gerrard, there was a lack of good standards this time around.
Their last chance with the ball was not good - only once they managed to separate the defense of the team he was playing on his own pitch - and it's a sign for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the rankings.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) there were people laughing and a blue sky as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many people who supported him showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also spoke out, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero to certain German Turks and believed to be an ‘autocrat' from others.
Road crash in Deptford: Cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist died in a crash involving a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics attended, but the man died on the spot.
This crash occurred a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by a car and continued on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday’s crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus diversions are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in disorder
Six prison officials were injured after a disturbance in a high-security men's prison, the Prison Office said.
The disorder began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officers were brought in to address the disorder, which involves eight prisoners and is located in one of the sections.
Officials were treated for minor injuries to their face on the spot.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to address an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year anti-riot officials were called to the prison to address a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with ‘pool' balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake city with Rapid Flooding (Drying Areas May Benefit)
Tropical depression is rare to hit Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves through the southwestern desert, leading to risks of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already established a rapid flood watch for Monday and Tuesday for from western Arizona to south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Las City.
Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Phoenix Weather Service noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status at a distance of 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950"!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to have from 1 inch to 2 inches, with possible isolated totals up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, Rosa's rainfall could be a positive thing as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the drought monitoring device, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, the second-highest category," reported weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa led to the touching of the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who will still be a very strong hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, will lie 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will travel north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting colder waters in the Pacific and therefore loses power.
Thus, it is expected to touch Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be severe, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with a possibility of no more than 10 inches," they reported by weather.com.
Then Rosa will move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and will then move through Arizona and south of Utah until late Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and in the U.S. southwest desert," they said from the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening rapid flooding and debris flows in deserts, and landslides in the mountainous terrain.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrested after attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured at Excelsior Terrace in the Midsomer Norton area, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon, said Somerset Police.
Officials called for anyone who could have a video of what happened to the mobile phone to speak.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘sent green and anger’ to Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said during a demonstration in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "sent out the green and the anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally rejecting an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her claim.
On Saturday, the President said that, on that day, the "American people saw the bravery and the quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable public service record", he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't want to argue, but in reality, I'm arguing," he said.
"That's why I'm running everywhere and fighting for very good candidates."
Trump has argued that Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant of the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds have been killed by the Indonesian earthquake, the tsunami, with the number of deaths seen increasing
At least 384 people have been killed, many carried as huge waves came down strongly on beaches, after a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to six metres (18 feet) high dropped strongly on the ground as it began to darken, while many carried and died and destroyed everything in the middle.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and didn't get up to run immediately and ended up being victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency spokesman at BNPJriffa.
"The tsunami didn't turn up alone, pulled up cars, logs, houses, hit everything that was there on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shoreline.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges that surrounded themselves and collapsed and a water-tight mosque.
Severe tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BBPT) said in the statement that the energy emitted by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said that the geography of the city, located at the edge of a long and narrow beach, could have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the wreckage of a collapsed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the quake.
Communications "were totally sent and without information" by Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," they said from the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were going to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting alarming warnings about the tsunami that was approaching people on the underpass.
Within a few minutes, a huge amount of water came down strongly on the shore, carrying with it the buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to authenticate the videos immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power outage that reduced communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military had started sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still needed food and other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived strong and full in the city of Palu, where employees are sheltering have been armed tarpole shells in their office yard, they have passed through where scenes of devastation are on their way, Mr Doseba said.
He said, "They told me they saw a lot of houses being destroyed".
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups started the unpleasant disaster relief process, a few of them complained about the fact that foreign aid workers with deep competences were not being allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only start entering if the disaster site is declared as a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster,' we can bring in international assistance but so far there is no status."
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that embellish this history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who was trapped under the wreckage for two days near her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which finished early this month in Indonesia.
Others of those captured at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior person in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how, in the hours after the news of the fall of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated among the paragliding community, he sent desperately WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the festival.
His messages, however, only marked that they had left, but they did not mark that they had arrived.
"I think that means the messages haven't arrived," he said.
Thieves take <0x24>26,750 while the ATM was being replenished in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's worker who was refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver was battling an ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While busy with his job, another man "runs from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identities should contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rap singer changes his name to Ye
The rap singer Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change in Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man who was previously known as Kanye West"
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye for some time and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the program which she cancelled for "emotional reasons," said the creator of the program.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West previously said that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"So I am, you are, I am, I am, I am, I am.
From Kanye meaning ‘the only one', to Ye only - simply a reflection of what we have good, bad, what confuses us, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rap singers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
As one who collaborated with West, JAY-Z, is also served with or without sing and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use militaries against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "he will never use the military to restrict the Mexican people."
Troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were being established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double funds for the I.A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in this area, says investor and practitioner IA Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the U.S. government made IA announcements, even if there is a lack of a formal IA strategy in the United States.
In the meantime, China has introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for IA research would be a good start, as all other countries are much further behind than the United States, and we are looking for the next revolutionary step in IA," Lee said.
Doubling funds could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent IA companies in China, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that won the player with the highest rating of American Othello, after which he was executive with Microsoft Research and the chairman of Google's branch in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government competitions in technology such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when it would be the next one, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Lee said researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
Lee said, "It's not China that's removing academic leaders; the corporatists are doing it,".
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired people who inspire others from universities to work on AI.
Lee said the changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen their efforts in the AI.
He said, "I believe the green card should be offered automatically to people who have a PhD in IA".
The State Council of China has released the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funds to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations issue money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that tried to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has seen no action in several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country;
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that resolves a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked its bids for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbour in its north represents a possibility of possession of its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change undermines the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the turnout will reach the 50 percent minimum required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote reads: "You are in favour of membership in NATO and in the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to join bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of name of the country giving him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was arming a small stage and preparing seats in front of the tents armed by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to enter proudly under our conditions, not by commanding others," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that a result in favor of the name change would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published Monday by the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum - an amount below that of the required participation.
Another survey, carried out by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it represents a first serious blow to the government's policy in favour of Western ideologies since the moment it took control in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, passes from all of Brighton's defence to the 'goal'
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his 'goal' in the 65th minute seem very easy.
The striker from Argentina received a ball from midfield at the start of the sequence.
One of Brighton's three defenders before he ran into a wide open space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green shirts.
He fought with one defender before escaping from much more to the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he crossed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English striker touched the ball for the first time in the box to redistribute Aguero, who used the right foot to insert the ball into the right side of the net by passing it from where Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is having some problems with his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about the fact that he was going to play 55, 60 minutes.
That happened.
We had the good fortune of making a ‘goal’ at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the Premier League fight.
That "goal" occurred in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball far inside Brighton territory in that action.
He sent the ball right to Leroy Sane with the left hand very beautifully.
Sane touched the ball a little before he led Sterling to where the pole.
The Sky Blues striker slightly touched the ball and put it into the net just before it slipped into territory it wasn't supposed to enter.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer must play in Spoiler vs. Rockies
Since Nationals were eliminated from the possibility of competing in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to restart.
But Scherzer hopes he can be the pitcher on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that the Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which are in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers' one WestL game.
The Rockies managed to gain a possibility to continue competing with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday evening, but are still looking to get the division's first title.
"Even though we are playing for nothing, at least we may have the possibility of winning as we know that the atmosphere here at Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What do you want to compete in these circumstances?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to let Scherzer be the ‘pitcher’ in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting for the 34th time, had a practice session on Thursday and will be playing as a pitcher on Sunday when he is usually resting.
The player from Washington who plays with his right hand is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 ‘strikeout' in 220 2/3 ‘innings' in this season.
Trump's Manifesto in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation regarding the election to his Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"In November, everything we've done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is very big -- I'm not contesting, but in fact, I'm contesting so I'm running everywhere I'm fighting for very good candidates," he said.
"We are seeing this very horrible and radical group of Democrats, we are seeing it happen now," Trump said.
And they are determined to take back power by using every possible means, you can see the green.
They don't care who they hurt, who they want to fly in order to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give them."
He said Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"And I've seen it over the last four days," he said, and was calling the Democrats "angry and green and nasty and dishonest."
He referred to the Democratic Senator rated in the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, and received many negative shouts from the audience.
"Do you remember her response?"
Did you get the document?
Uh, uh, what is it.
No, oh no, I expect, first of all - the movements of her body were not positive at all - the worst movements I have ever seen."
The group is no longer a large group.
It does not allow the person to communicate his or her views
When I was asked by the locals to vote for me, I didn't want to go to the polls.
After all, I am the most recent MP on a list of Labour Party MPs who were not positively welcomed - because we communicated our opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she fought against antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement to the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday evening's General Council meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more merciful and gentle" policy has long been forgotten if, in fact, it never really started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged as to whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political view began to expect to change understandings and take positions that I would never agree with in other situations - whether on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and, in fact, it makes no difference at all - they come after me on social media with a request to remove me from my post as MP, denounce the center's policy, and tell me that I don't belong to the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know that I have had better luck than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a lot of sexual abuse or racism every day but never hide from comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that abuse levels have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with every motion of "lack of confidence" or change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years that encouraged me to keep my opinions for myself, not to be so vocal and then everything "be well."
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by Thatcher's government's negligence to leave my comprehensive school class literally in a disastrous state, I have sought to improve public services for those most in need - either as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never lost my job, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been, in any way, confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I can say is that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and public services, I can't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Party.
But in truth, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to work for you and I promise you that no amount of threats that would remove me from my post or from my political compromising interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, who has not yet lost once, tops in the rankings
Two attempts could have slightly altered the result, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this exciting day's game of the Tenant's Premiership.
They are currently ranked first in the rankings, the only team out of all ten who have not missed once.
Ultimately, it was the superior defense, as well as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities, which helped the team, who was playing on his own pitch, win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've been through trials during our matches so far, and we haven't lost one, so I'm happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "We give credit to Ayr, they took advantage of the opportunities better than us."
With Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr were winning, but, a yellow card from Scotland's head Rory Hughes, who was allowed to play the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose an opportunity to try Jagkont.
Climo extended Ayr's victory with a 'penalty', before, just in the middle of the game, he made a 'goal' and converted an individual attempt to get the points to 17-5 for Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second part of the game well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggott, narrowed the gap by 5 points.
The match then stopped due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which emerged from the field on a streak, and as soon as the match resumed, Ayr continued to clear the points after an attempt by Stafford McDowall, converted by Climo.
Then, Ayr Blair Macpherson's chief agent was given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose came out with aggression when they made an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of hard pressure.
However, the team playing on their own pitch started attacking again, and when he was given a yellow Struan Hutchinson card for the action he did on Climo without the ball, from the line of the ‘penalty', MacPherson touched the ball to the ground at the back of the advancing Ayr group.
Climo converted, as he did again almost from the area from which the game started again, after Kyle Rowe collected the ball that David Armstrong met through the box and sent Gregor Henry, who plays alongside, to her own side's fifth attempt in a playoff match.
Still Game's personality seems to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The personality of Still Game Ford Kieran seems to be ready to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man who performs the part of Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC program, in which he writes and participates with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the next nine series will be the last of the program, and Kiernan appears to be planning for his life after Craiglang.
According to the lists of official registers, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was seeking to get involved in Glasgow's "very good restaurant trade".
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
The sailors guard the naval headquarters armed with ropes and chains in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue ocean-colored flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are lined with the motto: "The sea is ours right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Across all of Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict remains clear - as the desire for Bolivians to be able to sail in the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope is perhaps at its highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course is waiting for the result with positive thinking," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ's decision on big screens all over the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find, in favor of Bolivia's statement, that - after decades of irregular talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate and give solo to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for his re-election next year - also has much to lose in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to having access to the Pacific Ocean again," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia - and that little would change if it did.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to grant the territory of Chile, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the ICJ's judgment only arrives six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case "was not complicated" said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, an expert from Chile in international law.
And far from vitiating the Bolivia case, the last four years may not have been helpful.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' hostile rhetoric undermined any residual goodwill of Chile, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile, at some point, will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an "extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the "opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as political aid.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"Judgement is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri had spoken on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to deliver on the promises they made at a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
He makes his comments as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy that is stagnating more than three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it is "a hope in the void" that continued U.S. sanctions and objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will never force North Korea to surrender.
Washington is concerned about whether he should agree to the statement without Pyongyang making the first significant steps of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about relinquishing arms that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest collection of clothes for the massive head that will soon appear in the main shops.
If you want to add to your hat collection or completely cover the sun, you can stop looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a range of strange and very large headwear for their Spring and Summer 2019 collection on the runway that embellished the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats are appearing a lot on Instagram this summer and these designers have uploaded their surprising creations on stage.
The object that featured Valentino most was an extravagant beige hat decorated with a broad feather-like edge that completely covered the heads of the models.
Other very large sized accessories included jewellery-coated watermelons, a magic hat and even pineapples - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the coloured masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than ‘haute couture'.
One creation resembled the diving apparatus complete with snorkels and goggles, while the other was like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue with this style, good luck.
Fashion watchers predict that huge ‘bonnets' will soon appear in the main stores.
The very large hats come out after the exit of 'La Bomba', the two-foot-wide straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The ‘cult label’ responsible for the impractical hat that was widely seen on social media brought up another great creation on stage - a straw bag that contained almost as much as the model dressed in a gown as it was carrying.
The dark orange raffia basket, surrounded by the tiny raffia twine and a white leather grip, was the most featured creation in Jacquemus's Spring and Summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large sea hats and bags in main stores for next summer - as the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which is only reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to deliver the best possible level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, for their chosen career and for their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages remain a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak a man in a language that he understands, he will understand with his mind.
If he speaks in his own language, he will understand with his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are at the forefront of the ranking tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher A grade.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS schools that are members, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a Higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who study German, 69 percent of those who study French and 63 percent who study A Spanish also.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are now, as a choice of subject, being kept in the same regard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that from reasons given by employers to having sent to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, if one learns another language, this will have a real advantage in the future as it will have the ability to survive such a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the forefront of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and, with 15 percent, French is the only language spoken with a two-digit percentage.
That's why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, particularly those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will learn different languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to be successful, whatever the future may be.
It cannot be denied at present, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the country's future, and therefore this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
The fat's not fair.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
On Sunday LeBron will play for the first time with the Lakers in San Diego
LeBron James's sports fans have little time to wait for him to start for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening match before the season starts on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the number of minutes to be played will still have to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell wrote a tweet that, likely, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
After the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-match schedule before the Lakers season starts.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
Trump's Manifesto in West Virginia, Youtube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign demonstrations this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first out of five scheduled demonstrations next week, including stops in amicable locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote suspended for his choice to fill the vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in Nov.
What do you think about the Trump campaign in West Virginia and how do you see it online?
Trump's demonstration in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's demonstration in West Virginia online below through a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who have become intense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an anticipated Senate confirmation vote suspended for up to a week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary goal of this wave of demonstrations is to help Republicans face the November elections to gain some momentum.
President Trump's campaign said that these five demonstrations next week are aimed at "giving energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
"Congressional Control is so important to this agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we approach the busy campaign season," said a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named to Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening's demonstration could gather supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump will be visiting West Virginia, the state that won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to boost him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
The 2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. Team determined not to give up on Sunday's singles
After three one-way sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swing pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sport concept but one that players really believe in, and never more in such competitions.
So where do you think the momentum is now?
"They were in the lead with six points and now they're in the lead with four, so I think we're carrying this as a bit of momentum," said Jordan Spieth as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points in the lead with another twelve to play.
The Americans, says Spieth, feel but have a bit of a hindrance and have a lot to encourage them, not at least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Spieth was precise from tee to green and is leading by example.
That outcry from the heart of a celebration continued to grow as his round went on, making a crucial putt to bring the fourth match even when he and Thomas were two from behind two.
His character who won the game on 15 was greeted by a similar shout, the kind that tells you that he believes the American team is still there.
"Vera wants to go deep and worry about your own match," said Speeth.
That's what each of these players have left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sweet couple are four by four and considered perfect.
"Moliwood" were the only pair who did not darken bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the 9th after Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to move both to and from this live crowd determines that they are the players who are offering a challenge on Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun goes down on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at once on different holes.
But here we are talking about a European glory that is still early for it.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon finished by Sergio Garcia, the morning fourballs hero, when she was put in pairs with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front nine brought the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole that they never managed to get close to.
But there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see closely due to peer interactions, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in a second.
Europe played better as a team so came here and is in the lead on the final day but this foursomes session also showed that the US Team has the determination that some, especially on the part of the US, were doubting.
Europe in the lead with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after being eliminated from Saturday's four-ball and foursomes matches in the lead with 10-6 on the United States.
The pair inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made the effort with two wins over Tiger Woods which found it difficult to take their score so far forward in the Le Golf National for four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, ready to hold the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American side that went wrong in the morning fourballs, taking the series by 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but could not come to the difference in the score.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from Sunday's one player's 12th match to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European for the season to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After dominating over Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they then worked excellently to win Woods who didn't seem optimistic and to the new American player for the Bryson Dechambeau season with an even more empathic score of 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who found difficulty in both matches on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliance but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in the fourballs and the foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes for a 2<0x26>1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - which are ranked first and third in the world.
But it didn't all come as Europe desired on a beautiful day, with a little breeze in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a big winner three times, and Justin Thomas set the limit for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They achieved a brave 2<0x26>1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and returned later to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4<0x26>3 in the foursomes after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in Ryder's Cup history that a team returned from a four-point difference while entering the singles, though Furyk's sideholders need a draw to hold the trophy.
However, after being second best for two days, Sunday's counterattack seems to be going to be more than they can do.
North Korea says it will "in no way" disintegrate unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions were deepening its distrust of the United States and that there was no way the country would unilaterally leave its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "considered goodwill measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and promising not to proliferate nuclear weapons.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared to be significantly that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as a non-partisan.
Referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a U.S. president serving his duties and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work towards the "denuclearization of the North Korean peninsula" while pledging to oust the Korean Peninsula.
North Korea was seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to reduce tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive way, and even objects to the 'declaration of the end of the war'," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can break us is a dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are deepening our lack of trust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party to this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula was not like this."
Despite this, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korean rockets was unavoidable after Trump called Kim a "rocketing man."
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to dismantle, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denounces.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timeline for this, saying "If it takes two, three years or five months - it doesn't make a difference."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Thursday, told the UN Security Council that "Enforcement of Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and without stopping until we realize fully and finally verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with the aim of halting funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and after said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, after North Korea criticized him within hours for making "gangster-like demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "corresponding measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was looking for were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on taking enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has managed to make all of its undergraduate students sleep longer with the aim of fighting the growing macho culture of studying all night and staying awake thanks to caffeine.
Academics have found that university students in the first place in the world often have no idea about the basic real things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after making a speech about the impact that sleep deprivation had on learning.
Finally a girl came over to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in my last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which began for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials about how good sleep traditions aid academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that the students had had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a student's bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to counteract the effects of caffeine and light and on how athletic performance has an effect from a lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change students' behavior right away.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as much as you have a right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke cigarettes," added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of being proud that "you managed to stay awake all night studying" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that sleeplessness was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough sleep, and of good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of a student to fight stress, extreme fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid being overweight, since lack of sleep puts the mind in a state of hunger, which is hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist on a course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students who have graduated to do a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider making an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when they get up, and knowing about the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can balance your circadian rhythm, and lead to trouble getting stuck.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal hinders Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another period of distress when they played abroad as Dolly Menga's strike delivered Steven Gerrard's split side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's side were looking to make a record of their first win while travelling from their February 4-1 triumphal victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Hold's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches, leaving him a big boss.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and the list of Rangers players missing from the inspiration never seemed to catch up.
While Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and only behind Hibernian on a goal difference.
And there could be more trouble for Rangers after Linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently throwing an object on the side of supporters of the team who played abroad.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that passed Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-trained form hindered their opponents continuously.
Rangers could have dominated the possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They had to score just two minutes from the start when Menga's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder took his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs's strong free-kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his defending partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot from behind.
Rangers gained control but it seemed that there was more hope than belief about their game in the third final.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt he had to have a penalty on the fifteen-minute mark as he and Steven Lawless clashed but referee Steven Thomson ignored the appeals of the Colombian.
Rangers managed to aim well only two shots in the first half of the match but Ibrox's previous goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely worried him with Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's light strike.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have been when the other team was playing better, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
Once again, Rangers failed to manage Jacobs' good set-piece.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to select Menga to end the action.
Gerrard reacted at the brake by switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch almost provided an immediate impact as the winger shoots at Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston went on to attract visitors to play just the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett catching a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side were able to extend their leading position in the final stages but McGregor held up well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow went open from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty as he argued with Jacobs but again Thomson looked the other way.
Almanak: The inventor of Geiger's Contractor
And now a page from our Almanac of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, like today's 136 years old today, and we are still LOYAL... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Contractor.
A foundation of science since then, Geiger's Contractor has become a foundation of pop culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appear:
A man asked, "What kind of man is that?"
Rogers: "That Geiger Contactor, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these cuffs, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms giving the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "You say, she's definitely popular now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he turned 63.
But the invention of his name survives.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behavior.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behavior and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behavior as part of treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are converted into a laboratory
They can then "see" a common protein for many cancers and then be re-injected
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behavior, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, they are changed in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach to intake of immune cells from patients and how to "teach" how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Trump Verbal Attack, while wearing a MAGA Britta, after his appearance on SNL.
This isn't a good Marx
Kanye West was bombarded in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a confusing performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town in which he was wearing a make-up of America Great, he began to speak out against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white person and they ask me, 'How can you please Trump, what is racist?'"
If I were concerned about racism, I would have left America," he said.
SNL started the program with a sketch of the comedy in which Matt Damon appeared in which Hollywood star portrayed Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's video was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear if Rock was trying to fool you with West when he posted it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that they had caught up with him after the quiz about his beret.
"I'm stuck behind the curtains.
They said, "Don't go out there with that batter."
I've been bullied!
Then they say it's lost," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the lost?" and went on to say that he was going to "put on my superman's cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love."
His comments triggered a buzzing at least twice by the audience and SNL cast members appeared embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The whole studio has fallen into a great silence."
West brought him as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West was fond of many with the performance of the song I Love It, wearing as a Bottle of Perrier.
West had support from TPUSA's conservative group president, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANKS FOR YOU ARE UP TO THE FOOL."
But presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "what he is and this is something very beautiful."
"But I have not chosen to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their 'art') who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
"We're so different," she added.
Prior to the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "the former Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The previous rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and of course the music legend who is no longer with us Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder on knife-strike in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was knifed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington talks about toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor spoke of the hero's macho stereotype, saying that such roles on screen mean that the youngster often feels they need to be violent in order to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted to having "strong interests" to address the issue.
"Personally, I feel that I have a strong interest, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What were we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through his very male characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes young people feel like they want to be this certain side of a man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
It's very clear that something has gone wrong for the young man."
In the interview he also admitted that he will not make prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, saying that "so many wars and horses".
From November Kit will appear in Sam Shepard's new True West production which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this program, so in this way I gave my future family, and my life from here on out," he said.
Rose interpreted the part of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series she won at the Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in the land owned by Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people taking HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV from sex is an acute problem in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be common.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most transmissions of diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has revealed data of GOP senators, saying "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats have ascertained that claims were spreading from "ultra-right" pundits and websites.
"False, lies, and more hateful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure was made some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and released the information of a Waters staff member, reported the Hill.
"This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for disclosing this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It's an act of anger," Fleiss said.
"This suggests that it does not have the temperament to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they should not be angry.
It should not be resistant.
It should not question the defendant's motives.
It should be calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who were accused by critics of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will stand out to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also mentioned his voice on Twitter.
"That's a great thing if it's true," he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned the "appropriate law enforcement authorities and entities about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the authors will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally accountable for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to each and every one of my staff members."
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson, imitation of powerless espionage
It has become traditional now to search for meanings of Brexit in any new film with a British perspective and this seems applicable to the return of Johnny English's action-comedy imitation franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and revived in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will the ironic autosatire on the subject of how badly we obviously are, be the country's new export opportunity?
At any rate, incompetent Johnny English with big eyes and moving parts of his face not as usual had the renewed license for a second time to do everything wrong - what his name more than anything else shows is a widespread comic creation designed for English speaking non-cinematic territories.
Of course he is the stupid secret agent who despite his strange claims to his sweet fascination has a bit of Clouseau, a hit of Mr. Bean and a large piece of that man who contributed one note to the melody of the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony.
He is also originally based on the traveller and the international man of mystery who Atkinson had once done his part in Barclaycard TV commercials, today forgotten, after leaving chaos behind him.
There's a great time or two in this last issue of JE.
I liked the moment when Johnny English was approaching a helicopter while he was wearing medieval armored clothing and the blades of the propellers clung to his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy appears, but humor feels rather poor and extravagantly strange, especially since the film's "serious" brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves confidently offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humor is felt as if it were aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's strange unfortunate incidents were not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's wordless film jokes in Bean's persona.
The perennial topical proposition is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain's very secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all of Britain's agents in the field, to the disappointment of the agent who was at work - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the cherry on the cake for the prime minister who is an imperious and difficult figure, who is already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this character like Teresa May but there is not much in the script to work.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to bring someone to retirement.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in an elegant building, but gives unofficial lessons on how to become an infiltrated operative: a few good jokes here as English offers a School of Rock-type spying academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and joins his former long-suffering partner, Bough, interpreted once again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, with a submarine commander, the role of a smelly one interpreted by Vicki Pepperdine, in which she is slightly wasted.
Thus the inseparable two who always confuse everything in her Secret Service of Majesty, are back in action, when they encounter the character of a seductive and beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the rule of the sweet technology billionaire who claims that he can solve Britain's computer problems: syndicate Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of horse fun behavior: dressed as waiters, setting fire to a high French restaurant, creating chaos to board Volta's luxury yacht; and English begins a complete anarchy as he attempts to use Virtual Reality cuffs to familiarize himself with Vojudar.
Certainly all stops lead to that last sequence, but as amicable and animated as he is, he has a little idea of a children's television.
It's something quite moderate.
And like Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really deserves his talent?
Labour denies it is preparing a plan for the British to work a four-day week but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see the British working for a four-day week - but be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company teachers to pass on the remnants of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them another day off.
This would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but still taking the same pay with them.
Sources said the idea would be "appropriate" with the party's economic agenda and plans that the country is turning in favor of workers.
The four-day shift has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"This will not happen from today to tomorrow but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker as well as the party's global industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the aspiration is currently not being endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "beneficiaries" in utility firms.
The opposition chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back their full share as a Labour government can make "deductions" based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to give 10 percent of the equity of private sector firms to employees, who are willing to take annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh FBI investigation could change their minds
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by one week, raising the question of whether the Bureau's findings could influence any Republican senator from withdrawing his support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Create, and sure," said Kennedy.
"I said, as I entered the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, and after making that allegation, I said, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unwoven."
However, Graham's vote, it seems difficult to change.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and you want it to be a very big charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And any person who mentions it can't verify it.
She is 36 years old.
I didn't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a very impressive list of stars to be seen and a similarly impressive mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people go to the Great Lawn of Central Park to not only enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true 20th goal.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a representation group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were ready to pay a VIP ticket), those going to the concert had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, send an email to a world leader, make a phone call or some other significant ways to help raise awareness about their goal to end poverty.
But how successful was the Global Citizen with the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
The idea of people being rewarded with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - do people feel they are making a real difference by signing a petition online or tweeting?
As of 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its posters, which it has set for a number of different goals.
It says these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements from its actions, at least <0x24>10 billion of which have already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that the safe funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people across the glare.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," with a promise to provide Rwanda with <0x24>35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 pledges.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of denaturation a footnote in history," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman to the crowd at a live concert in London.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions to invite the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website asking "what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It's going to be a long and hard journey - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among some of the artists to be featured at this year's event in New York, featuring Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States uses the Navy for a "blockade" to block Russian energy exports - Internal Secretariat
"If necessary", Washington could resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's growth in Syria - especially, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern side of Europe," he allegedly said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of addressing this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to make sure that the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to make sure that their energy has not reached the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees to the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that disguises itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
"The economic choice over Iran and Russia is, more or less, leveraging and replacing fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "one-size-fits-all" with a fuel-dependent economy.
The statements come as the Trump administration was on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to step out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin the "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 gasser, which is expected to double the capacity of the existing gaser to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's intense opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has invited the US to stay away from Europe's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will 'Examine Well' Whether to Run for President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, on Saturday said she would "examine thoroughly" whether to run for president after the midterm elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider leaving.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and this includes a woman in the highest position," she said, according to The Hill.
"After the 6th of November, I will examine whether or not to go out for president."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump at the council meeting, saying he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was direct in her criticism of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released Thursday, showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think she should stand for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not stand for election, according to a poll of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported the issue for the election.
Surveys showed more exit support for the election than previous Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting an exit for the potential election and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have been discussed regarding a potential exit for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin refers to PTSD of Track Palin in Donald Trump's manifesto
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being recorded in September
He was arrested and charged for a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after his return, I can relate to other families who feel the ramifications of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience in a demonstration for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the obvious problem that no one is addressing" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they return a little different, they return stronger, they return to think whether there is that respect for what other soldiers like them and airmen, and any other member of the war."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was prosecuted over a domestic violence attack on a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was abducted, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support a new asylum policy challenge
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and district, Friday filed a court friend case in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the actor in the Grace vs Sessions case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and the boys members of his violent gang," abused her but U.S. officials denied her asylum claim on July 20.
It was held in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, producing a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations face pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Friday, in a statement, District Attorney of Columbia Karl Racine, said the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum claims to be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a plea violates this principle, said the case of a court friend.
Lawyers went on to argue in the event that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop giving asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of deaths doubles in a fight against time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation has become increasingly dire.
"It's very intense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she was hugging her baby with fever at an evacuation centre in the unfortunate city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching in their flooded possessions, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were too full.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to his back and shoulder, remained outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to continued strong shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recounted that he felt the violent earthquake moving the floor of the hotel on the fifth floor that he was using with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have a chance to save ourselves.
Crushed with the remnants of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in place for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her family.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper tried to sell the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China's paid daily supplement in the Des Moines Register - the most widely sold newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a campaign escalating from Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that has seen them pass rounds of tariffs on imports of each of them.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the long-time former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion page at Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now it's doubling this bullying by making propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's cherished tradition of free expression and free press by placing a paid advert in the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, on the newspaper stand down the road here in Beijing, you will find limited disseminating voices and you will not see a true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's problematic economic trajectory, since the Chinese media is found under the Common-Piston restriction."
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Are Alienating Women Voters Before the Mid-Term Elections with Kavanaugh Debate, Warns the Analysts
As many top Republicans are backing and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while facing several allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see an adverse reaction, particularly during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions about this were very high, and most Republicans are already officially showing that they wanted to run by vote.
These things cannot be reversed," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University told The Hill for an article that was published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute push for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
Friday morning, the protesters sang "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate hall as the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to run with Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be of a very high level," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst to the news site.
"People are saying they were already high; and it's true.
"But they may be higher, particularly between female voters switching votes in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, while disliked by the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested she could pursue an adverse reaction if Republicans run by confirmation.
"This has become a complete confusion for the GOP," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans handled this situation and how they handled it," he pointed out to news station Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect d-Demo.
However, Americans seem to be somehow divided on believers in light of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with little more support for the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed definitively or probably Ford's statement, while 35 percent said they believed definitively or probably Ford's statement.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his statement, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the push by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as at least another indictee, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they were at a party while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor plans to launch a new Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a new business looking to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "domination of the world."
"We have to do it now," he said of the new business.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal data store" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of what needs to be done, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What makes the online personal data store unique is that it is entirely in the hands of the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal automation through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring in the right resources, process skills and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought by IBM, some developers in staff who have a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications through the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they should introduce a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down from today to tomorrow.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-built site."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established a World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic for this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebrated Victoria Cross of the First World War
The only Church of England cleric who won Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
The Lt Kur The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was to be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award winning.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, the Lt Kur led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in many fog and fire from field rifles and machine guns."
He later rushed to the line of fire and with "greatest courage" led the line forward before going to a rifle on the spot alone and losing three senses from the trump.
The Lt Kur was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never get there but something very humiliating."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also put a garland behind the parade, which was run by the Imperial Brentwood Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "being very honoured to have played a role in this parade" and added "the courage of a genuine hero was being shown by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA players stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead ending with Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you've been up all night watching Bellator 206 packed to end up being denied seeing the main event.
The list from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were being shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK remained stunned when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the fight.
One Twitter user described the change to a child's cardboard as "some kind of foul joke."
"It is a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was therefore inappropriate for them to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about transmission.
"Pep the pig," yes."
The president of the company Belator Scott Coker said they will work on their scheduling to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think when I think about repeating, we'll probably be able to sort something out," Coker said.
"But at the moment there are six o'clock in the morning and we won't be able to arrange until our Sunday of our time, their Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
When I first heard the news, there were a lot of messages going on and not all of them were cute.
We were trying to fix the solution, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was not, it was a governmental issue.
I can assure you that the next time will not happen.
We're going to limit it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we've tried to bring more to the fans and instead we've gone too far.
It is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'inferior' because of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old man said he did not realize until he went to high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he became less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
While appearing as a setback on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less than" others as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "Until today, those emotions that you feel less than, and you feel different, were the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove it was "something", he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually get to know about his sexuality.
The Olympic bronze medalist twice became a high-profile promoter for LGBT and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky that he could live freely without reprimands and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world winner said that when he became in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - he was "surprise" for him.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When she goes through so many things at such a young age - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had similar beautiful and unpleasant experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, the important thing for me was to 'I want to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are more things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the things he had asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 - as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, p<0xC3><0xA0>'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally recognized it was invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that this was what I've dreamed of my whole life - to fight in front of a crowd from countries at the Olympic Games, there wasn't a better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the first selection of his song - Proud of Heather Small - which was compatible with him on the Olympics' walk and still ignited the cold.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson who is no longer in shape remains on the bench in the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to change his form to avoid being an important stage not so happy.
Mickelson, who plays in the biannual event for a 12-time record, remained on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being the center of action, as it has often been for the United States, the big five-time winner shared his day between supporting and working on his game from the distance in the hope of rectifying what worries him.
One who would never give the ball a right even in the fullness of his career, the 48-year-old man is not ideal for Le Golf National's difficult track, where the long distance raft over and over again punishes erroneous cuts.
And if the course alone isn't heartbreaking enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth game, faces the precise champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who joined new-season Tommy Fleetwood, to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, with four points less than the start of the 12th single match, start well, Mickelson's game could prove to be a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he played today, tapping on my back and putting his arm around me and saying he'll be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"They have a lot of confidence in themselves.
It's a Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I've seen more, but this is the way it worked and this is the way we thought it would go.
He needs to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson is set to skip Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has quite never reached the millennia of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halfs, although Furyk said his presence brought a few intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke with people, and he's a very good man to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players took pleasure in criticizing him, this week, which was something fun to watch.
It provides much more than just games."
European captain Thomas Bjorn that the big position in the front could disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a sizable front position before the final day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an uncomfortable trip.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a hand led by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point lead over the Americans but ended up with a narrow real margin, with a victory of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"Keep reminding yourself that we had a great front position in Valderrama; we had a great front position in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a little bit," Bjorn said, in the press, after seeing the 2018 Classes win 5-6 on yesterday and Friday.
So the story will show me and everyone in this team that hasn't finished it yet.
Tomorrow, you'll go with your body and soul.
Get out there and do all the good things.
It wasn't all over yet until you got the points on the team.
We have a goal, and that's what we're trying to welcome this trophy, and the focus will stay there.
I've always said, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we know very well what's on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Satisfied with how his players played on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "Never go an oltr<0xC3><0xA8> pass from me in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow concerns the individual performances we see, and this is something different to do.
It's very nice to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there individually, you're then tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you want to pass on to the players, to get your best tomorrow.
Now, leave your partner behind and he must go and get his best, too."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than when they did as partners, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who earned three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those last days that could change everything, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before finishing a defeat as Europe made the "Miracle of Medinah."
"I remember until the least word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you want to get to that start as quickly as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medinah.
When that one-sided momentum arrives, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle parties.
We drew up our list appropriately and put those men the way we felt, you know, we're trying to do a few miracles tomorrow."
Thomas had been given the task of trying to lead the fight back and face Roy McIlroy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of men in this way because I think it covers all the way," said Bjorn about his singles choices.
Germany's new war postponed once again
The newest fleet of the German Navy was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the ageing Cold War-era fleets, but will not be there until at least next year due to systems with local defects and rising costs.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the flagship ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a spokesman for the military.
The vessel was to join the Navy in 2014, but the post-delivery problematic issues dampened the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that ordered the Navy back in 2007 will come as a replacement for the ageing Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile display as well as some cautious technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - this should be possible to operate the newest tyres up to two years away from home ports.
However, continued delays mean that the latest technology vessels - which mentioned allow Germany to project power offshore - will already be outdated by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 frigate of misfortune appeared in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivering.
Little was known about the reasons for this, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that made the ship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the workers on the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appeared that the vessel has a well overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future updates.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price of the whole project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
This is said to have reached a staggering amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6bn) - from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest frigates become especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy currently "has a lack of vessels to withstand deployment."
The official said the problem grew over time, because old ships were commissioned but replacement vessels were not provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is named after the Secret Life of the Butterflies.
New research being done on the ground in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape when looking for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of single flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and suprano pipistrelles as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Rice.
Special records will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of the batsmen during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all the recordings will ascertain the frequency of the calls of the bats and what species you are doing.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced which will create a detailed picture of the scale of their behavioural landscape.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as creating pastures and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from construction and development work affecting nests and habitat loss.
Wind and light turbines can also pose a risk, such as poison cards to catch insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Butterflies are currently not blind.
However, due to their notturning hunting traditions their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated ecology technique to indicate insects and obstacles in their path when flying.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only butterfly reserve in the Threeave land in Dumfries and Galloway, hosting eight of Scotland's ten species of butterfly.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a very good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, a lot of veterinary trees and the entire good habitat.
But there is a lot more about bats that is not yet known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of checking bats for maintenance in properties as it is possible that an unintended destruction of a single maternity nest could kill up to 400 women and the young, possibly destroying an entire local population.
Night butterflies are protected and it is illegal to kill them, pester them or harass them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer for the Butterfly Conservation Trust at Night, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we still don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as lawyers are ready to search for a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo remarked rape claims against him as "fake news," saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are expected to seek in court the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that at the time he had left her <0x24>375,000 to say nothing about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking on video on Instagram Live with his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, remarked the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," said the Ballon d'Or winner five times while looking at the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They have to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is going well," the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to court Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player seeks compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the breach, which is likely one of the most serious breaches of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was said to have taken place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her by anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "well man" disappointed with the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two were sexually involved, but that this was by consensus.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "horrified by retaliation" and was worried that she would "be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to reverse the solution as she is still being traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer he joined Italian football legend Juventus in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK "forever regrets" that it has lost car manufacturers
The UK "forever regrets" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was a "concern" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit would be worth jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Auris and Toyota Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a production halt in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is related to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line today operates on an "exactly timely" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a border barrier that industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep an inventory of more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that allows, as I say, not only success to be enjoyed at the moment but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what was a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not tell how long production would be halted, but in a longer period, it warned that increased costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the convenor of the Unite union at the plant, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience when these jobs leave, they will never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's risky meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could "be delayed by another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's aides and Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will dismiss the deputy attorney general, jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has instigated Washington's rumours for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25 amendments.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, despite reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, which was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to expel Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid being discredited by the hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh over a week period, which delayed further full Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "A date has not yet been set for this, it may be this week, and it may be the following week because of all the other things going on with the supreme court.
But now we see and I always like to keep the press up-to-date".
Some journalists dispute this assertion: Sanders has not organized a press meeting in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of the meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists "who try to attract and influence the audience", although she said: "Although I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more Q<0x26>A sessions compared to any previous president," she added without quoting any evidence: "We looked at those numbers."
The meetings will still be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask questions to the president of the United States directly, this is far better than talking to me.
We try to do this a lot and we have seen doing this many times in the last few weeks and this will replace the press meeting where one can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump rarely answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaves relaxedly and sometimes strangely in front of groups of journalists.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit-related fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and desire that they remain there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP has sent a letter with less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to the cost of applying for a defined status for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal, which are moving towards decisions expected this autumn, continued.
But the UK Government has also been stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is definitely an unstable time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to support now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring with them valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and are beneficial to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would very much like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Performs Emergency Surgery After Suffering a Rasu Injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday when his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores by 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the halftime.
"He went over the side line and like he fell there," said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before putting him on a streak and taking him to the back for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was no longer operating at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no detail on the type/extent of the injury" and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in the university's second year suspended, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after leaving Illinois.
Saturday in total he had five tackles before leaving the game, leading to the total of 18 tackles of his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty when buying property in the UK with extra money used to help homeless people under new Tory plans
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on non-tax payers in the UK
The Treasury expects it to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers must pay a higher stamp duty rate when buying property in the UK - with extra money being used to help homeless people.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high-wage earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and non-tax-paying firms in the UK, with extra money boosting the Government's efforts to combat street sleep.
The additional fee - which is additional to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental purchases - could be three percent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Around 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which are raising prices, making it more difficult for new buyers to take the first step in the housing purchase phases.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "fantastic cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time abroad.
The new policy came out just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a stamp duty cut to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by seizing land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon allowances on affordable homes in order to rectify the "shameful situation of housing" in the UK.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of eye-catching proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of dismissals "without any fault".
He also wants to give councils great powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my post to bringing back the dream of the United Kingdom - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means we're going to fix the broken market of our accommodation.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and live here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies find it as easy to buy homes as the bustling residents of the UK.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too distant, and the dignity of sleeping on the streets remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his "fundamental ambition" is to one day become Scotland's manager.
The 42-year-old Scottish is facing the challenge of resurrecting the Northeastern club, which is currently in third place in the League One, with three points different from that in the first place.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership in the final season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and nothing more," Ross told Sportsound of the BBC Scotland.
"But when I was still a child, I often went with my father to see Scotland play in Hampden, and that's always the thing that drew me back.
However, this opportunity only comes if we succeed in managing a club."
Those who have previously been Ross as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he is not worried about the fact that he would follow such established names at such a large club, while previously rejecting the offer from Barnsley City and Ipswich.
"At the moment, the success for me will be based on 'can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'"
Due to the structure and facilities of this club there is no doubt that this club belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy thing to get there, but I probably think I've only succeeded here if I can get the club back there."
Ross has only been three years in his career as manager, after a period of assistant chief at Dumbarton and after spending 15 months with Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegations for the third category, transforming St Mirren from the relegations edge to champions of the Championship title the following season.
And Ross says that he is now feeling more comfortable than he has felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
As for taking Alloa into his own hands, he recalled that "probably this was a big change."
"I always thought that the role of a manager was the most suitable for me, much more than that of a player.
This may sound strange by going well, having a decent life, and enjoying some reasonable achievements.
However, the games can be difficult.
There are many things that you have to go through every week.
I still experience this in terms of stress and work pressure but I simply feel that the manager's post is suitable for me.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I feel that throughout my adult life I'm now feeling the most comfortable."

Research shows that the best time to take a pint of beer is at 5.30pm
The summer heatwave has boosted UK pub earnings in difficulty but has put more pressure on the same company's restaurants.
In July, groups of pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales - but figures revealed that earnings in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a business advisory CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "Continuous sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when sales in pubs increased by even more than 2.8 percent, hitting just 2.8 percent.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant trade in June continued to worsen in July.
The pubs and bars whose main sales are beverages were the ones that performed most well in terms of financial results compared to the previous period while restaurant sales declined.
The pubs whose main sales are food have also suffered in heat, though not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.
It seems that people just want to get out.
In pubs and bars managed beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while food dropped to three percent."
Paul Newman, one of RSM's entertainment and hospitality analysts, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of the take-away market sales.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales will be particularly burdensome in addition to the ongoing cost pressures.
The hot, long summer could not have come at a worse time for operators whose main sales are food and only time can advise us whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much-needed rest."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the opening of start-ups, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in start-ups.
Monitoring the sales of the Coffer Peach Tracker industry to the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined revenue of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the industry's established benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey reveals that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "fake Insta" pages
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they have a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to Instagram's photo-sharing site.
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a presentable "principal" account to show to their parents, while having others private.
A mother who met her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a young girl who was urging others to rape her - "rape me."
Research, from Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of young people aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that many young people are encouraged to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will become the "voice for athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the track and non-track athlete who has won the most medals and president Ian Beattie has described this change as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her vast experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by becoming part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as a voice for athletes and I hope to be able to really contribute and help to run sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among his total of four Olympic gold medals and who is now a regular BBC critic, ended up walking away after suffering a small stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "It's been a month for me.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time can advise us whether or not to recover or to what extent.
It was a beat job but I recovered completely, I learned how to wake up again and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertisement comparing mothers to cows gives rise to different opinions online
A breast pump company has given rise to different opinions online with an advertisement comparing lactating mothers to cows being abandoned.
On the occasion of the launch of what is seen as "the world's first wearable, noise-free breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released an advertisement inspired by a video of ironic music to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers to use.
Four real mothers dance in a straw-filled mural with a disc that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I cross myself but I don't have a tail" and "In case you didn't realize they're not nipples but chests."
The chorus continues: "Pump out, pump out, I'm hoping for my babies, pump out, pump out, I'm melting my women."
However, the ad that was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 spectators and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from viewers, many of whom say it sheds light on the "terror" of the dairy industry.
Someone wrote "It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except that their babies are taken to them within a few days of giving birth".

Someone else commented: "One understands that this is a traumatic thing for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "A really detached advertisement from reality."
Others defended the ad, with a woman admitting she found the disc "very entertaining."
"I think this is a genuine idea.
If I were to buy one, I would buy one.
It made me feel the same way as a cow.
It's a bit of a messy, but I've got it.
"It's a natural product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (often on their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not an ad that commends or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they were all dancing with unobtrusive pumps placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump, making no noise, has no wire or tube and sits in a breast-feeding bra without giving in the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even come out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing the women who use the breast pump with the dairy cows we wanted to focus on pumping the breast and all the challenges it brings, while showing in a fun and permissive way, the incredible sense of freedom it will bring.
This is not the first time Elvis has appeared in the news.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Walked Wordlessly to a Tent Camp at the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply despite the month-long border crossing remaining largely unchanged, in part because rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult for the children to be placed with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that presenting themselves to take care of a child would jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or housemates of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and most of them are foreign criminals.
That's why we continue to look for these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In order to make the child-involving process faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear through a video telephonic conference, instead of in person, in order to bring arguments in favor of their case to legal status to an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for aid will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the more children are kept in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or distressed, which may lead to them expressing themselves violently or trying to flee.
Lawyers said that these concerns increase in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is/is finding it difficult are more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the town of tents without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or without saying strength to their peers can lead to trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria tells "occupying forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be addressed appropriately."
"They should withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we are expelled from all Syrian territories" both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, many of them training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-ravaged country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good for them to return, and he blamed "in some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that led the refugees to keep away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last strong major rebellion created an opportunity to keep the political talks going.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be restricted "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump won the second term of office
With this logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 as long as, as many liberal viewers hope, denunciation and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
What is without a doubt "the most dramatic finale that has ever been in a presidency!"
So far, it appears that the viewers have not been satisfied.
As of 2014, time ratings with the largest number of viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time with the largest number of viewers, more than 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has increased cable television ratings by even 3.5 million viewers in major viewers.
"This is a situation that is attracting people to it because it is not something we understand," said Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC drama program "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary becoming president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Why bother me,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
In this case, there is a value of entertainment.
Undoubtedly, unlike anything else on TV, the titles of the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, this goes beyond being an informed citizen when in the sixth you find yourself following a panel of experts discussing the use by Bob Woodward of sourcing "with a deep background" for his book "Fear," the jacket bomber with a <0x24>5,000-skinned "Pool" stamped with a poster.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of what he's doing making it as if this is a reality show is that every night he's bringing you something," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the cast that changes and develops.
You can't afford to lose a single episode because otherwise you fall back.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his home the weather was sunny with a temperature of 80 degrees on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not be ejected from television, not when Brett Kavanaugh was ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
"I remember when we used to do those eccentric programs and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but in fact they were right."

Large amounts of money coming from abroad for the tightest race in the White House midterm election
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's seventeenth congressional district is seeing a large amount of money, thanks to a realignment of congressional districts that acquired two operators in a race for the same seat.
Recently re-established the pits of Pittsburg suburban district Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running as a candidate against another operator, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old twelve districts, extending heavily over the new seventeen districts.
The maps were re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were played out unconstitutionally in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new seventeen districts provoked a difficult financial campaign contest between the main party's finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) (Congressional Committee of the Democratic Campaign) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after winning with little difference in the March special election widely followed for Pennsylvania's eighteenth Congressional District.
That seat belonged to a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political critics have given the Democrats a small advantage.
The U.S. decided to penalize El Salvador for supporting China, and then decided not to do so.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little help from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a welcoming meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and had a hotel in Panama until some partners sacked the Trump Organization's administrative team.
State Department officials have decided to re-contact U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said a spokesman for the Department of State at this month's Heather's statement.
But the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received around <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid, including narcotic controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have weighed heavily on the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings began to progress, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to pursue a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with a view to effectively ending any consideration of a penalty for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been strongly criticized for addressing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration places on the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three sent Americans quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and harsh message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman, Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were supported by a foreign analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
A study of history
The next unexpected negative event could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, about which there is now very substantial evidence in the public register.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that Congress passes to another person, Mr. Trump will find himself responsible in that body, as he prepares to go back to the voters, and perhaps eventually his peer jury.
This entails a lot of uncertainties, and I do not intend to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalent in Europe.
There are choices to be made by all on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight lasts.
In 1938, German officials were willing to perform a coup d'<0xC3><0xA9>tat against Hitler, who would have resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We did not succeed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves with such points of reflection, and the inexorable path of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today, the United States faces many of these points of reflection.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this document reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be secretly recorded and speculated that he is unsuitable for the post.
Mr Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
"How will we answer if Brett Kavanaugh's new requested F.B.I. investigation is incomplete or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual conduct and dishonest testimony?
And above all, in the middle of the terms we will vote for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, it will take a long time for there to be a shift in democracy.
But I don't think I will fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the home of my ambassadors.
She managed to live, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, on the day of worship God sent me to light candles on that table with swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of competitive match with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with the recognition that the win against the Austrians, following their impressive match against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2–2 tie result with Villarreal but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for big things.
"It was a good point for us since Villarreal are a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We came to the game with the belief that we could achieve something and came up with a point.
We could have won it in the end but, all in all, an equal result was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
It's going to be a big European night again.
We hope we can get three points but this will be difficult because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I am sure we can continue to try and get a positive result.
The past year has certainly been difficult, between everything that has happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but despite this, there is a sense of positivity at the moment.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying it very much; the training is being good.
I hope that we can now do our best, forget the last season and succeed."
Women are concerned about this fear of retirement related savings.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said that they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be a family member who cares for them, but they're not taking steps to make a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
You have to start that.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't express your wishes well ahead of time.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive treatment, as those options can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a value of money in order to help cover these costs or self-insurance at your own expense - provided you have the money.
Make a decision after discussing your legal documents in the long run: Avoid legal battles.
Find a healthcare proxy to select a reliable individual to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider proxy for your finances.
Choose a person you trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the finances that are involved, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Let's see if that plan is ready."
A man has been hit several times by air rifle shots in Ifracombe
A man was hit several times by air rifle shots as he walked to his home after a night out.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ifracombe, Devon, when he was hit by shots in the chest, abdomen and hands.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries did not pose a threat to his life and the police called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With faults in communication lines, aid officers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala retreat, which is an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, about the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central province of Sulawesi, located on the edge of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regression that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The regression, an administrative region under a province, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the economy of the Central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mine is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also struck the western side of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in the northern part of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and in early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 magnitude struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast with great force, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, beyond Sumatra, triggering a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's retreat in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people recalled the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
This time no tsunamis were triggered, but more than 100 were killed as a result of buildings that crashed.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, which killed more than 500 people, mostly on the island's top.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance attempted to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her hand.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured <0x24>500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "certainly, not guilty" when asked to give his motive, reported the network.
Palin is facing three Class A offenses, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and would have to pay a <0x24>250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B crime, which is punishable by a day in prison and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interfering in the domestic violence crime report, and having a weapon in his possession while he was ambushed in connection with the incident.
His wife said that she had been stabbed in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after a comparison was made between her son's violent behavior and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not functioning with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just a little bit outside the centre of Sulawesi located in northeastern Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
The media are circulating videos that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore with great force.
Federal prosecutors are demanding that the suspect of the NYC terrorist attack be given a rare death penalty.
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding that Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, be given the death penalty - a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck of a Home Depot to carry out a bicycle road attack along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, flying pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to the notice on intent to claim the death penalty, filed in the New York District.
According to the court document, these two indictments carry a possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed Saipov 22 heads of the charge that included eight murder charges with the help of organized retaliation, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Describing the manner in which Saipov carried out the attack "gross, cruel and immoral", prosecutors said the attack required "substantial planning and premeditation."
The notice of intent states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hermicon Hercognan, Hermiconan Ferruchi".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last sued a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being found guilty of conspiracy to commit espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were killed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the chief of the charge.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 chiefs of the charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who was representing Saipov, said they are "certainly disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea for life in prison with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
MP Tory says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised that he would "mobilize the people's army" .
The former head of the Ukip said politicians had to "feel under pressure" from Eurosceptics - as suggested by one of Theresa May's own MPs that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party government member Peter Bone told the demonstration in Birmingham that so far the UK "would have emerged" if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May's challenge to reconcile her deeply divided positions has been highlighted by Tories who are not in favour of Brexit who joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track among the attacks by Brexiteers, those against Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that despite the negative reaction it will continue to move forward to try to reach an agreement with Brussels - forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour party to choose between its package and the "kaos".
Mr. Bone told the rally Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "shoot Chequers' plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given a high social position and should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have been out so far," he said.
MP Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit but we need to abandon Chequers' plan."
Declaring that he is against the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We have to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is not absolutely true."
Andrea Jenkyns, Tory's Brexiteer, was also present at the demonstration, telling reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers' plan is not popular with the general public, the Opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not popular with our party and with our activists who are actually the ones who go to the streets and who vote for us first.
Please forget about the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message aimed at Mrs May, she said: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should "feel under pressure" if they were to backtrack from the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to get back from Brexit and we're here today to tell them that 'we're not going to leave you alone if you do this'."
In a message to the crowd, he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point of coming back from Brexit.
We are mobilising in Brexit the army of the people of this country that has brought us success and we will not spend until we become an independent, self-governing and proud UK."
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Following the group's launch this weekend, a small number of activists trended banners with the lyrics Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit).
Lord Adonis who holds a high social position in the Labour party has ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with the party's app as the conference opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the IT systems in place and technology for Canada and more, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a full ride.
The idea of a good Brexit does not exist," he added.
Warren intends to "examine" the possibility of going to the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections she will "examine carefully the possibility of going out for the presidential election".
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday a member of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about its future in a debate with citizens at a municipal level in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will stand for re-election in November against State Representative GOP Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of speculation that could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents who have been using the format of a debate with citizens at municipal level since Trump took office.
A person who attended the meeting asked her if she intended to go to the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington to repair our fragmented government, and this includes a woman at the top."
Arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU Sims
Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect was arrested in connection with the shooting of the LSU's Wayde Sims basketball player that took place Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, at 11 a.m. ET News Conference.
Friday they released a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify the man who appears in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
According to 247sports, on Saturday police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media "Wayde Sims suffered from a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result of it."
Wayde came to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was asked questions and admitted that he was on the scene, that he had a weapon, and admitted that he shot on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and was held in custody at the Parish Baton Rouge East Police Department.
Sims, a young six-footer who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after his team's orders gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Saturday, from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes' team orders would play an important part in the race.
From the position on the inside in the first row, Bottas had a good lead and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his friend.
Vettel was the first to enter the stop zones and left Hamilton with the others in the group's last place, something that had to be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in the stop zone after another lap and came out just behind Vettel, but Hamilton went on after a little wheel-to-wheel action which caused the Ferrari driver to make it difficult to leave the indoor side free due to the risk of crashing back after a lap.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place by the end of the first lap on his birthday at the age of 21.
Then he was in front for most of the race by not changing his tires with the aim of completing quickly and jumping Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He eventually entered the stop zone in the 44th lap but was unable to step up his pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen came in fourth place.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a very good job throughout the weekend and it was a real gentlom saying let me by.
The team did a really exceptional job to get first and second place," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad physical attitude
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday in connection with her insistence that she did not reveal the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "vil and nasty and dishonest."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are bullied and humiliated and nasty and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and disclosure of information and then say 'No, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, revealing any information?
Remember her answer... uncovered the document - "e, e, what is it?
No, it doesn't.
I didn't reveal anything."
Look, wait a minute.
"No, no, we didn't," he added, citing the senator.
Feinstein sent her a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it was revealed earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the disclosure was coming from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein told the committee, reporting The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her confidential and I kept her confidential as she requested."
But it seems that her denial was not well received by the president, who commented during the Saturday evening rally: "You know what, that was a really bad physical attitude.
It may not have been the case, but it's the worst physical attitude I've ever seen."
While he went on to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three people, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You're seeing the villain, the disgust, they don't care who they hurt, they don't care who gets the sticks in the wheels to get power and control," the president said according to reports from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made good on Friday's Elite League defeat to Belfast Giants by winning the match against the same opponent 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants gained a two-goal advantage early in the game with two attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the same score for the team playing at home before Dwyer regained an advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard earned the same score for Dundee before two goals by Lucas Lundvald Nielsen confirmed their win.
This was the third victory of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who after several defeats advanced to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
This was the fourth time this season that these two teams met, with Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's first goal occurred in the fourth minute at 3:35 with a pass from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford giving the pass while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a multi-action opening period, Sullivan brought the team playing at home back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie a pass at 15:16 bringing the same score for both teams.
Dwyer ensured that Giants would gain an advantage until the first break of the game when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The team that is playing at home has rejoined and again thanks to Bouchard they reached the other team with a strong goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee an advantage for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and secured the fifth goal win for his team in the middle of the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller dies to ensure that hundreds of people on the plane could escape from the Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being seen as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people manages to land safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have been lost after a major quake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Heavy tremors continued to dominate the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to rescue, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the swinging control tower at Palu Airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained calm in order to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which at the time was on the runway, could safely leave.
He then jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman, Johannes Sirait, said the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he left us this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"When we hear about this, we feel very sad," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is estimated that the number is still increasing because many bodies were still under the rubble while many could not be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The waves that reached up to six meters destroyed Palu, where on Sunday a mass burial will take place.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance enters the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Markets are going to be everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia are working hard to help those who are still alive but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to the evacuation.
Ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, which was operating a flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man is missing, having previously said that the 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, she was unable to give details of where one male passenger was located.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Last week, officials said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon a little away from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had jumped the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to pass through the water that was high to their waists until the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants were puffing and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were working nearby to improve a pier also helped rescue by using a blown boat to carry passengers to the shore before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that in the last two decades 111 people have died in airline accidents recorded with PNG but no accident involved Air Niugini.
An analyst presents a timetable of the evening in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution concluded its evidence on the case in the new trial of a man who is accused of having burned a woman from Mississippi in 2014 while she was alive.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile phone records to gather together information about the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received localization data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the mobile phone date showed that he was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on the Sabbath and testified that he was not in the city on that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night he was in Sanford's truck, Sanford said he was "being lying, since my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, phone calls and contact information from his mobile phone.
"He saved her from his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to start its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Three hip hop artists must challenge the negative perspective of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that the hip hop has moved beyond its origin of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and make the hip hop conscious popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
Nanny from NY sues couple for dismissing her after "racist" message
Nanny from New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an error message from the mother who was complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist, and compare the cause to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed regret when she learned that the new baby-sitter, Giselle Maurice, was of dark carnage when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"LEEEEEEEEEE PERSON OTHER SEW," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After noticing her coarse mistake, Plasco-Flaxman felt "comfortable" and dismissed Mrs. Maurice, saying that her former grandmother, who was African-American, had not done her job well and that instead she was waiting for Filipina, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her one-day work and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation in relation to the dismissal, and is claiming <0x24>350 a day for the six-month live-in position for which she was initially employed, even though without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, you can't do such things," she told Post Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple attacked the claims that they were racist, saying that the dismissal of Ms. Maurice was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing that they could not trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't intend to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco to Post.
"But would you trust your children in the hands of someone who spoke with a gruff, even if that was by mistake?
The birth of your baby?
And come on."
Comparing the case with "extortion", Plasco said it had been only two months since his wife had given birth and was in "a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to accuse someone like that?"
It's not a good thing to do," added the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly announced the couple on social media, insulting them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is reading it for the first time before it was published.
"It's really fun to now know what we know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book by a small game bear, would certainly have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "pleasant but somewhat gloomy" after his death.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he never stopped talking about it.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't full of himself," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child to get something: be proud of them even if it wasn't you who got something.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success that way.
Although he was his creation and imagination, he was always giving the merits to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to give her the last greeting on the phone.
As soon as she landed her daughter was immediately taken to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked to save her life but it was all in vain.
"Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to live," said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to give her the last greeting.
And so I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were slowing down and leaving her system slowly.
She had died some time before and it all started to fall apart.
All I could do was sit down and wait, aware that all this is happening.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold back."
Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who had been crying for the loss of her daughter, eventually got on the plane along with the other passengers - who were unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had a low head, and the tears began to fall all the time.
It was difficult to explain, but there was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy towards Nad.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Post cards of distressed women to avoid suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost a loved one to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were affixing cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everybody knew his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room."
However, he had to quit his job before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then aged 11, was the one who found his brother after he had killed himself.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always afraid that this will be the cause of another ugly event."
Ms Davis created the cards, "to let people know that there are people you can open up to or meet, even as a friend.
Don't put in the silence - you need to talk."
Ms Humphreys, who has been a friend to Ms Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or so," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day it was very bad - when the children opened their presents he did not make any eye contact with them or anything like that."
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but they wanted to fight her: "Leave a gap in the family.
We're separated.
But we all have to keep on fighting and keep on fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in a precarious situation as the FBI launches an investigation
"I said, if we could achieve something like what he asked - a time-limited, purpose-limited investigation - we might have brought a little unity," Mr Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "collapsing" amid partisan paralysis.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the choice of time.
Mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans do not go well, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to put the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was picking up the phone to call the Senators, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through which he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI presents its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where they currently occupy a position of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to vote and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea "slows" under Kim
The number of North Korean deserters for South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from the South Side Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug, said there were 1,127 changes in the party last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates that human smugglers were demanding were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comment.
The vast majority of deserters from the North Side are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Many of them escape by crossing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross compared to the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers deserters as illegal migrants instead of refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
Relations between the Upper and Lower Side - technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that were focused on stagnation of denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress made since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, we will in no way be the first to unilaterally disarm," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "steric," saying he is not able to work in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi called the person nominated for the Supreme Court Mr Brett Kavanaugh "steric" and said he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because of his temperamental behavior.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't believe in the fact that if a woman had ever behaved in that way, they would have said 'steric'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both still young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and groaning when he was talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotty and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, because he showed he had anti-Democrat bias.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi came up when she was asked if she would try to indict Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say something -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, so he's not able, not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also to be in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative justice.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would change certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It is not appropriate for a person with hysterical biases to go to court and wait for us to say, 'Very good,'" Pelosi said.
And women need to exercise their authority.
It's a fair verbal attack, months and years filled with anger, and she can't say what she has to say without crying.
"We're crying when we grow up," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, what do you say?"
She added, "It helped me a lot a woman who was trapped elsewhere, who said that even she was crying when she was raised, but developed a technique that meant that when she was raising and crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, 'Probably you think she's upset because I'm crying.
I'm pissed off."
And then it didn't stop.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Crying is allowed as a way to excite one's great anger in part because fundamentally they are misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of the first jobs I had, in an office dominated by men, where I once found myself crying with indescribable anger, was when an older woman grabbed me by the neckline - a cold manager that I was always afraid of - to carry.
"Don't let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're being bullied.
They think you're upset and they're happy they managed to hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Democratic congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he would run for president.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage relationship on a boat known as Monkey Business and came out of the election, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply doubted, concluded that there was no reason why she did not explore the idea of coming up herself for the presidential election.
"This was not a well-thought-out decision," she said with a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who were going out for the election, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Nani."
As this was at the end of the campaign, she was behind in fundraising, so she swore she wouldn't go out for election if she didn't make <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who were giving <0x24>1,000 to men to her were giving her only <0x24>250.
"Do you think I'm getting something?" she said.
When she made her speech announcing that she was not going to launch a formal campaign, she was so emotional - grateful to the people who supported her, racked by the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters instead of delegates, and racked up - raving towards.
"You probably thought I had such a strong brake," Ms. Schroeder recalled about the way the media reacted to her.
"I thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.

How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The numbers of aerial bombs of the opening of the U.S.-China trade war have been slowing down, and while the battle remains to end, a misunderstanding between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued a first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods amounting to <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing all goods entering the United States from China.
Beijing retaliated each time in the same way, while more recently it was presenting tariffs of five to ten percent on <0x24>60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to agree with the United States every time, and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will give up in the near future.
The fact that Washington takes a step back means accepting the demands, but publicly the fact that China ceded to the United States will be too embarrassing for <0x58>i Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing acts wisely, the US trade war pressures could support China in a long-term positive way by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that start economic chaos in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what spectators have recognized before," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
Another 6 million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime welcomes help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the sediment.

It's been a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, very happy that I got the cup back.
The team is everything, and I'm happy I was able to help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot partner John Ram who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2<0x26>1 in singles play Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel, that I won Tiger Woods, when I was raised to follow him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup record throughout his career.
Strange statistics of one of the best players ever to have been here, winning 14 main titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find those parts of the golf course with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put some pressure on Europe.
our argumentation.
To Thomas, we take the hat.
He's a very good captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We will reunite, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
You have to pick up the hat and tilt your head.
Play better than it."
