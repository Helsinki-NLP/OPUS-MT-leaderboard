Why did I leave the PDP?
Former President of the Federal Assembly, Yakubu Dogara, has explained some reasons why he left the PDP and moved to the APC.
Not to mention the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara has been ousted by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and joined the APC this week.
Trusta said that he stood by the PDP governor Bala in Bauchi State who helped the finalist win the 2019 election, gathered and left the party and returned to the APC.
The main reason why I'm leaving is how the PDP governs in Bauchi State.
Everyone knows my role in the state governorship election that former Abuja minister Bala Mohammed defeated the incumbent governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
But now I'm in a state of disrepute.
Instead of staying in the PDP, I'd rather stay out of it and go back to where I came from.
He wrote a letter of resignation from the PDP which he sent to the leader of the party of his constituency, Bogoro C, in Bauchi State.
In the end, he said that as he has repeatedly pointed out to other governors where they have failed and where they will be reformed in the past, he is also not affected by the oil spill.
I'm ready to leave them
A fire broke out in a house in Kano.
The fire erupted at about 10 p.m., which lasted for almost two hours, despite the fact that Kano State Fire Service officers and security personnel and the local community were taken to the scene.
During Freedom Radio's visit, she found the public in silence and various security personnel at her location, being the location connected to the main bus station known as the Kuka Station, which transports passengers from Kano to other states and even neighboring countries.
In addition to the market that has emerged in Northern Nigeria.
Freedom Radio spoke to some and other eyewitness accounts, who said the fire caused a surge in survival among the public.
A car inspector at the Kofar Water Station said they were collaborating with patrol officers to rescue passengers who were panicked by the fire.
The Kano State Fire Service confirmed the incident, saying that by the time we compile this report it is continuing to collect data to identify the causes and losses caused by the fire, as explained by the spokesman of the Sa'idu Muhammad Ibrahim.
On the other hand, there have been reports of some misfits attempting to infiltrate the Kofar Water market for theft, but police and syndicate officials have tried to expel them and secure the community's property.
On that basis, we contacted the spokesman of the Kano State Police Command DSP Abdullahi Haruna Niyawa, who confirmed the incident.
KORONA: We have not yet completed the testing of the quality of the combined drug in Nigeria.
As European countries continue to test the quality of their combined coronavirus vaccines, Nigeria has also not been left behind in its own drug testing.
The National Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC) has said it is testing up to 40 coronavirus drugs delivered to the agency by traditional pharmacologists.
The President of the Mojisola Adeyeye Commission announced this on Tuesday in Abuja.
Mojisola said the quality of the drugs was being tested so as not to seek revenge.
Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, traditional pharmacologists have stepped up research to see if they had been left behind to see if the disease was combined.
Many of them have submitted their samples to the authorities for testing and evaluation of their quality.
The NAFDAC also set out some conditions and rules to be followed in conjunction with the treatment.
Testing of the quality of the drugs in animals will be carried out for the first time.
Mojisola has warned drug addicts not to hesitate to try a drug without the agency allowing it.
In May, the NAFDAC said it was only in social media and newspapers that the news of those claiming to have discovered a traditional remedy that would cure the coronavirus.
Adeyeye said only one person had contacted the NAFDAC to look into the quality of the drug he claimed was a traditional combination, which he said could cure the coronavirus.
He also said that this was not a cure for the disease.
He said he had identified the symptoms of the disease as symptoms of the disease.
However, since then, some members of the public have taken part in the
Ramaphosa faced questions in the House.
This is the first time in a series of interviews that President Ramaphosa has faced in front of lawmakers since there was widespread corruption among senior officials of his administration and some members of his own administration.
Ramaphosa has pledged to deepen research and reform in the area responsible for overseeing the procurement of anti-covid-19 products.
South Africa ranks fifth on the list of countries affected by the coronavirus pandemic, but the president said corruption played a key role in the fight against the virus.
On Saturday, Nigeria will open its national and international airports.
Authorities in Nigeria have said they will open airports for both outbound and inbound flights, starting next Saturday, for the first time after five months of closure.
Since March 23, the country's government has suspended the flow of flights, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
The government has said that the first four flights from overseas will begin landing in the Federal City of Abuja.
The city of Lagos, but it is not yet clear where these planes are coming from.
According to the Minister of Transport Hadi Sirika, the opening step is to see that there has been no problem since the opening of domestic flights on July 8.
Sirika added that it would be ensured that all necessary rules are followed to ensure the successful return of the aircraft.
A total of 591 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Nigeria.
On Friday, 591 new cases of COVID-19 were reported.
The number of new cases of COVID-19 in the country has reached 39,539 of whom 16,559 have been recovered and 845 have died.
The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, has released a number of individuals and states on its Twitter account.
There are more Coronavirus victims in our group - Marseille.
France's Marseille football team said three more players were infected with the coronavirus, after five deaths last week.
This was stated in a press release issued today.
The club also said the French League 1 tournament, which was scheduled to start last Friday, was postponed as a result of five players infected with COVID-19.
Marseille also said it had already informed stakeholders in the preparation of the League 1, as a result of the increase in the number of people infected after the first five people were infected, in order to get a solution to the situation.
The APC has sacked the governor of Niger and attempted to bring about a riot in the party - Leader of the House of Commons Newspapers.
In a statement issued by the APC on Tuesday, the Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, accused of attempting to bring about unrest in the party.
The document, signed by the Chairman of the Engineering Party, Muhammad Jibrin Imam and the Secretary of the Party of Barista, Muhammad Liman, states that in the six years of the party's ownership of the state, only N512 million has been earned.
The document went on to say that the meeting called by the governor for stakeholders, which he chaired on Sunday night last week, would help to keep the party in turmoil, where they said they had written to the National Secretariat of the party what was happening in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "We understand that the Governor of Niger State has been trying to divide the heads of the party by organizing a meeting of stakeholders, which is illegal, because any complaints made against the party leaders, are written to the Secretariat of the Party of the Zone, to investigate."
He added that in the six years since the founding of the party, N512 million has been in the party's account.
He said, what he understood as the governor of being on the National Holding Committee set up is July 25, 2020, led by the President to manage the problems between the members of the party and the withdrawal of complaints in court between the members of the party.
How much money do we get to pay the salaries of the party's secretaries, and other activities that affect the party, the primaries and the adjustment of some of the problems of the party's members such as medical support because of the lack of access to government support, not any of the party's funds that we illegally spend on the party, and we challenge any of the party's employees?
As I have said, the primary elections for the state's local government are the most important elections to be held in the country that we have held with the former commissioners and commissioners who now hold the reins of power in all the state's 25 local government areas, with the sum of money to be disbursed.
It's a mistake for anyone who is illegally spending the party's money, it's almost unfair to try to protect him from being hanged, and it's not going to be a committee set up to investigate how the party's money was spent and who founded it.
Of the sums that the complainant alleges were stolen, the sums that the National Secretariat of the party provided, not any other such sums, I challenge anyone on this issue to prove his guilt in any way.
Imam said that we stand firm in defending the APC from the attempt to dislodge the APC or whoever or any group from dislodging the party, adding that any allegations against the party or any party leader from the state level will be written to the zonal control committee as stated in section 21 (B) (b) of the party system.
Therefore, the party's stakeholders have no particular role to play if they attempt to seize the power of the committee so their verdict has no effect.
For this reason, they are the best leaders of the party who have been recognized in the state, 21st and 6th paragraphs on page 87 of the party constitution, anything contrary to this will not be used.
It is the responsibility of leaders to make mistakes.
He said that those who presented with confidence at yesterday's meeting were not members of the party's executive committee in the state, which was not promoted by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners.
The executive committee of the party's stakeholders, the chairman of the engineering party, Mohammed Imam, will be the only one to be led, not a governor to be led by the party's state leaders.
The paper added that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of fulfilling the promise made to the people of the state during the election, and of going with the party's parents in government so that everyone in the state and all regions would benefit by giving political positions, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The document commends the members of the Federal Parliament who have refused to attend the meeting and draws attention to the reconciliation of all the problems between the members of the party, this is not surprising to the members of the House of Assembly who are aware of their own injuries, who have refused to accept false arrest as the law of the party.
Therefore, there is a need for the chairman of the National Holding Committee to draw the attention of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello on the appropriate position rather than to attempt to disrupt the state's politics.
Nigeria's economy is at a standstill - Freedom Radio Nigeria
The Minister of Communications and Internet Economic Development, Dr Isa Ali, Pantami, said the country is ready for a revolution in the internet economy.
He also said that the government is ready to work shoulder-to-shoulder with university experts and other stakeholders to ensure that the country is reliant on all aspects of modern technology.
Dr Isa Ali Fantami made this known during an international conference on the development of communication technology held on the foot of the internet.
The minister also added that one of the first steps taken by the government to see the country's connection to telecommunications technology is to change the ministry's name from the Ministry of Telecommunications to the Ministry of Telecommunications and Economic Development of the Internet.
How food insecurity affects the health of people in Nigeria.
Some scientists have warned people to refrain from eating foods that are used to prevent dietary damage that such foods are harmful to human health.
This was followed by a study of the quality of food in the country.
The results of the study indicate that there are certain foods that are being injected with chemicals to prevent them from becoming contaminated.
Research has also shown that this chemical is most commonly used in beans, a village of algae and dryshell fish that are supplied to the public.
It is used because it is thought to be a political interest to use it.
Then eating food containing this chemical causes cancer, kidney disease, heart attack and others.
People in this country are urged to focus on preventing the use of these kinds of foods for their health.
One food quality expert, Grace Olasumbo, has called on Nigerians to refrain from eating wood-milled calcium carbide.
Olasumbo explained that the mineral calcium carbide chemical is the most commonly used by marketers in milling the moisture of the wood, i.e. sweeteners.
Research has shown that patience and tolerance are among the factors that make marketers use this chemical because within a day it shows the fruit of the tree.
Olasumbo explained that one thing the marketers couldn't understand was the use of this chemical to show the harmful effects on human health.
As a result, we are diagnosed with diseases including mums and ferrets, eye pain, urticaria, sore throat, mouth, liver and others.
The president of the African Development Bank has been cleared of allegations - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
A committee of experts led by former Prime Minister Mary Robinson cleaned up the African Development Bank (AfDB) chairman Akinwumi Adesina.
According to the Akinwumi Adesina Committee, he is not guilty of fraud.
The AFP news agency reported that earlier this year, it was a 15-page report accusing Mr Adesina, 60, of having prioritised his lack of leadership and self-confidence.
However, Robinson's panel of experts, together with Gambia's Chief Justice Hassan Jallow and World Bank Deputy Governor Leonard McCarthy, who oversees the integrity sector, have purged the former Minister of Agriculture of Nigeria from all the allegations.
In the past, the U.S. has insisted that Mr. Adesina should be investigated for the allegations, following a purge by the AfDB's board of directors, which led to the establishment of a committee of experts to investigate the allegations.
COVID-19 has banned the Trump election campaign in Florida.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that he had cancelled the Republican convention scheduled to be held in Jacksonville, Florida, next month, as a result of an increase in coronavirus infections.
The conference will be held in North Carolina.
Trump has said in Jacksonville that it's not right to hold a convention at this time.
President Trump transferred part of the GOP meeting to Florida last month after they clashed with Democratic Party leaders in North Carolina over holding the meeting in a closed-door meeting with his supporters without wearing masks.
A handful of Republican delegates will gather in Charlotte, North Carolina, to formally elect Trump on August 24.
Trump has said he will be speaking in a different format.
Trump, who has spent months expressing concern about the impact of the pandemic, also said recently that 99 percent of the total number of cases seen in the United States would be unaffected.
Buhari will not accept the blessings of God.
The chief adviser to the media, Garba Shehu, made this clear in a statement issued by the palace on Wednesday.
He also said that the President would not welcome children to come to him in order to bring him greetings.
Shehu said this action was taken as a result of the recommendations made by the Islamic Supreme Council to curb the coronavirus.
President Muhammadu Buhari also stressed the steps that the council recommended to follow to avoid meetings that would be held in the same place.
During the same year's small prayer festival, the president prayed at home with his family instead of going to the mosque as he usually does every year.

China has achieved its People's Wealth and Food Achievement Achievement - Leaders Newspapers.
Food is the lifeblood of all creatures, and can only be lived with food.
This is the reason why the Chinese authorities are increasing their efforts to ensure the prosperity of the country's people and food.
In the 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved major achievements in food security, which has surprised the world with an estimated population of 1.4 billion.
This effort has helped China to make a major contribution to the eradication of world hunger, as the Chairman of China's Grain and Agricultural Administration Zhang Wufeng has stated that, from 1949 until now, China has always put the issue of tackling hunger ahead of all travel activities.
But in recent days, some people and other Western media have again expressed "concern" over the issue of whether China can raise its own nation in the shadow of the outbreak of COVID-19 all over the world.
We are so grateful to them for their continued support in the world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country has achieved enough food based on its efforts.
The issue of providing enough Chinese food is one of the main agendas of the ruling JKS party on a daily basis.
Last weekend, the Secretary-General of the JKS High Committee, you are the President of China, <0x58>i Jinping issued an important order to stop food spoilers, pointing out that everyone knows that any food intake and workload is a problem.
Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is also detrimental to China's economy, China can provide enough food for its people.
China's statistics on the number of agricultural products, especially rice, in 2020 show that the number of rice harvested in the country in the first quarter of 2020 was 27.29 million tons, up by 1.08 million tons, an increase of 3.9% compared to 2019.
Ke Bingsheng, a former head of China's Agricultural University, said China has achieved great achievements in terms of food and nutrition, compared to the early implementation of the goal of making changes at home and opening doors to the outside world.
Huang Jikun, director of Peking University's China Agricultural Policy Research Center, said during a meeting with a representative of The China Science Daily that China's current challenges are likely to be met within the next two or three years, or that China could reduce the rate of pollution and pollution.
Today, the average weight of each kilogram is 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms that every individual in the world should get each year.
China is now importing millions of tons of agricultural products for domestic animal husbandry only.
Therefore, those who are concerned about the issue should calm their minds, bathe and fall asleep, or refocus their thoughts on the affairs of their home country.
The Chinese are able to raise their own food and feed themselves.
The reason why I brought Ganduje before a court - Abba K. Yusuf - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The PDP governorship candidate Abba Kabir Yusuf explained why he had brought the governor of Kano, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, and other businessmen before the State High Court.
Abba Kabir disclosed this through his lawyer, Bashir Tudun wuirci, who said he filed the lawsuit, alleging that it was owned by some of the government buildings owned by the people of Kano State.
In addition to the Governor of Kano and the businessmen, Abba Kabir Yusuf also appealed to the State Ministry of Works, Housing and Transport and to the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice of Kano and the State Lands Authority.
Abba Kabir Yusuf has accused the Kano State government of owning a few individuals at the former Daula Hotel, which is currently under the supervision of the Wudil City University of Science and Technology and the Shahudi Station, saying it violated the country's laws.
It is only available for purchase in 2023 and will be available in 2023.
The mother's son, as well as President Muhammadu Buhari's best friend, Mamman Daura, has said that the current state of affairs in Nigeria is now the norm.
Momman Daura said Nigeria has already made a commitment to abandon its current acceptance process in the selection of the most qualified candidate in 2023.
The BBC has published an interview with Daura's mother in which she explained this.
This adoption process for the Nigerian presidential election did not produce an eye-catching son that began in 1999.
Instead, Daura said that focusing on determining the right one is not until this process of acceptance is followed.
The Igbo people, the Inyamiri people, responded to this statement.
They said he and his brother, President Buhari, had confiscated the monarchy by means of a coup d'<0xC3><0xA9>tat and that he would now come out recommending that it should not be done in 2023.
Buhari himself is not the most elected of all Nigerians.
In addition to the fact that many of the top security officers in the country have not been removed from their seats for many years, they are also far more likely than any other job.
Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Inamirai
A political storm of the Nigerian presidency that broke out on Wednesday, as the Igbo Zalla Tribal Muradin Protection Group, Ndigbo shook Mamman Daura, over the Nigerian presidential boat's remarks to the Igbo tribe.
In an interview with Daura, who is the brother of President Muhammadu Buhari, he said there would be a zoning scheme in the 2023 presidential election.
Since his words did not end with the sociable media, Ndigbo quickly issued a statement to his Mother Daura, calling him a disparate musician.
In a statement released by Ndigbo on Wednesday, the Igbo Zalla Tribal Group of the South Region, and south of the South-Eastern Region will be allowed to emerge as president in the 2023 election, the same Igbo tribe.
Igbo Zilla's spokesman, Emeka Attamah, said Mamman Daura's words as the Nigerian presidential squadron in 2023 were against the Igbo tribe.
So, why didn't my mother-in-law go back to school in 2019?
They are about you and they have sacked Jonathan, and now Daura is in charge of the southern region as the coach who will preside over Nigeria in the 2023 election.
"When he finished his speech at the hands of his brother-in-law, the current president, and he will come up with something we don't know about in 2023.
As an adult, he should be able to hold on to the truth.
In 2023, the President of the United States issued a statement saying that he was self-centered and self-centered.
VOA Discussions on Rape
The issue of the rape of women and children is common in northern Nigeria where reports have been received of the denial of children's rights.
On July 23, people from different parts of the world came to the hearing to discuss how the situation was worsening in the country and how it should be tackled.
The participants of the meeting related the problem to issues such as the promotion of girls and the neglect of other parents.
One of the mothers who attended the Hajia Fathia Shaibu meeting, the former wife of the governor of Plateau State and Niger during the late Sani Abacha's rule, described poverty as one of the things that dora's parents make publicity for their children.
Maryam Nasir, head of a group that is fighting against the disaster, said: "First, we should go around and inform the mothers about the benefits of leaving their children out of advertising, so that the child will also be out of the way to be harmed."
We also call upon the Teachers to begin preaching with a strong voice to the parents and siblings who are raping their children and their own.
He, a member of the House of Assembly representing Maiyama, Koko and Besse constituency of Kebbi Honorable Shehu Mohammad State, expressed regret and support for the enactment of a strict law that would punish anyone arrested for rape in the country.
At the end of Hajia Madina David and Nasiru El-hikaya, the co-chairmen of the meeting, thanked those who had attended the meeting on behalf of the VOA who had accepted the invitation.
Contribution of the "New Media Writers" to the North
Modern social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Kakadamiya and others, have long been instrumental in creating dialogue venues, cooperation and relations between different communities around the world, with the delivery of messages, stories, and the dissemination of political and educational policies.
Young people in Nigeria have been involved in this new technology using social media, to travel with the modern world, to donate or toss their mouths at the Sabbaths that affect their lives.
We can say that these cycles have brought us a lot of advancements that young people in the North are benefiting from in business, economics, education and politics in the region.
A number of them eat by writing and delivering messages on the web, getting jobs to do or improving the tasks they manage.
But it is disappointing to see how some young people instead of taking advantage of this opportunity to benefit from the progress achieved, there have been others who have followed the devastation of the South's youth who have excelled around the world in harassing the public, both inside and outside the country, or in writing about the abuses and abuses of judges and predecessors.
This is a sign of the lack of progress in the lives of young people.
The arrival of the North Media Writers in the country is a great blessing, in order to provide the young North with a perspective, a good direction and clean up the activities of the young people in Soshial Midaya, so that they can be written meaningfully and spread the goals of the North's society.
It is imperative that we give this organization the unity it needs, in order to achieve its goals of kindness, which will bring prosperity not only to our northern region, but also to Nigeria as a whole.
I encourage our young people, especially social media users, to come together to protect the North's dignity and freedom, and to create a system that will be transformative for everyone.
As many of our Northern leaders who slept like Sardaunan Sokoto, the first Northern Premier Sir Ahmadu Bello, and his closest associates set out to provide for the Northern community.
It is reported that the late Master Aminu Kano, a veteran of the fight against oppression and poverty, once said that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his father's house!
So we say, of course, as we call for the creation of national development and the improvement of governance, at every stage, we call for greater cooperation on the part of the Northerners, without discrimination of religion or ethnicity, to bring about our region's development.
Let's take a look at what the North is up to now.
Therefore, we should use the wisdom God has given us to contribute and advise, in order to provide the North with a satisfactory way to revive its economy.
The North should provide revenue streams to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to run out of money.
In addition, as long as we want to advance the North, we attach importance to education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.
We don't have to make money, there are different ways to do it.
We believe that this is the way to achieve our goals!
We are proud of the North.
The government has set aside N126 billion for the rehabilitation of the country's hospitals.
The federal government has earmarked N126 billion of the country's economic development plans for the rehabilitation of hospitals in the country.
The hospitals to be refurbished include the FMC Hospital, places for clinical trials, the Department of Emergency Care, the Department for the Prevention of Unwanted Diseases, and teaching hospitals in 36 states in the country.
Last year, some health agencies called on government departments to work together to raise enough funds to improve the country's health.
The call was made by the experts at the meeting to ensure the provision of quality health care to people in Abuja in a simple and effective manner.
In his speech, Senatorial candidate for Kwara North under the auspices of the APC Sadiq Umar said that the Nigerian government should take matters to improve the health of the country as important.
The failure to do so is causing the problem of lack of funds, which makes it more dependent on the support it receives from abroad.
In spite of the lack of support, Umar said that the government's role in health care has not been seen as such, which has led them to begin withdrawing their support.
KORONA: Nigeria has surpassed 53,000 cases in Nigeria.

Hungry people in Africa will be killed by the Coronavirus - IFAD.
The International Center for Agricultural Development (IFAD), has revealed that there will be at least 23 million more people dying of hunger in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2020.
This was stated by IFAD President Gilbert Hungbo at the World Economic Forum Conference.
The children's conference discussed the issue of Food Economics in Africa, during the coronavirus pandemic.
Hungbo said a study, forecasting the scale of the food crisis, showed that by 2020, the number of people dying of starvation in Africa will exceed those killed by the coronavirus.
The IFAD is a centre that is famous for supporting people living in rural areas in the development of agriculture, increasing their children's diet and providing them with income through agriculture.
Hungbo said the Coronavirus showed that there was a serious problem with the food supply, distribution and repair system.

Buhari is not the only one with the right to national security - Nanono - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
National Minister of Agriculture Alhaji Sabo Muhammad Nanono has challenged state and local governments over the security problem in Nigeria.
In an interview with Radio France International's Hausa department on the issue of security in the agricultural sector.
The minister said: "The truth is that it is not only the federal government that has the right to defend this thing, state and local governments, if you go to the land until Dagatai and the locals, they are allowed to re-establish this security situation to become what it is, but everyone rises up and says the federal government."
Yes, the federal government has the right to protect the public's lives, but all those who are close to these people should also start by saying that we think we have a problem with these things.
Alhaji Sabo Nanono added that the federal government is doing its best to promote agriculture and food production in the country.
President Trump has taken the initiative to reduce drug prices.
On Friday, July 24, U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law four Presidents' bills to reduce the amount Americans spend on prescription drugs for them as he faces re-election campaigns and criticism of how he has dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.
Trump had previously said he would make almost all changes to the law he signed into law on Friday, but this is the first time the law has been signed into law.
One of the laws would allow for the importation of prescription drugs from low-income countries such as Canada officially, while another would require companies that control drugs to reduce their costs, according to Trump.
A law also requires a reduction in the price of insulin while the fourth law, which may not be enforced if the pharmaceutical companies meet successfully, will require the Medicare insurance system to buy medicines at prices that other countries are buying, according to Trump.

Kano's seniors have announced the launch of Ganduji on Buhari's behalf - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Kano People's Liberation Fronts have appealed to the Governor of the State, Abdullahi Ganduje, President Muhammadu Buhari for his bid to borrow a loan from a Chinese bank to build the railway line.
The formation of more than 15 groups under the auspices of the Kano Forum has described what it called a debt crate that the Ganduje government wants to buy to build the first section of the railway line in the city of Kano as pointless to see the major challenges facing the state.
The group alleged that Governor Ganduje would receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>684 million in debt, about N300 billion, which they said had not been paid by the government for 50 years.
Alhaji Bashir Othman Tofa said it was almost impossible for Kano State to take on more debt than it had previously been charged.
The death penalty for rape in Nigeria is not the best - a husband.
A class fighter in Kaduna State, Aliyu Majidaje, pointed out that the death penalty for rapists in the country, especially in northern Nigeria, is the only solution.
Alhaji Aliyu Majidaje said this in an interview with Leadership Today in Kaduna, where he added that after an investigation, the death penalty was the only solution.
He added that the decision will reduce the number of rape cases that can be easily found, but the main one is to correct our hearts.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, "We have no knowledge of what is going to happen to us, but we have to ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
It would be a shame to say that a man who is a full-fledged adult or an elderly man is raped by a three-year-old girl or a three- or five-year-old girl.
He went on to say that, in contrast to God, we will not insult presidents or national leaders, pointing out that there is no way to make progress if there is such a situation.
He added that we are in a state of shock and anguish in the country because the country refuses to move forward, they themselves, the Rulers, the Governors and the President, have lost their way.
He also said that if we were to go back to the moon, we would have to change our hearts, so that God would give us the best possible solution to the problem of rape.
He knew that even if they were to do so, they would have to do everything for the sake of God, because He was the one who would overcome all misery and poverty.
God knows what you're doing, and He knows what you're doing, and He knows what you're doing, and He knows what you're doing, and He's going to make you feel like you're going to die.
He pointed out that the official police are also doing their best to send the alleged rapists to the courts and the judiciary to do their own best to try this potentially catastrophic situation in our region of Northern Nigeria and in the country.
He called on parents to pay close attention to their children, setting an example of how dora's mother-in-law is making the situation worse.
He said that some parents do not follow the lives of their children, whether they have gone to school, whether they have gone home on time or not, adding that it is partly the fault of some parents because they need to know that it is God who gave them their children and that tomorrow he will ask them about their children's behavior.

Farmers in Biniwe Expected Growing Up and Places in the Nation's Grandparents - Leaders Newspapers.
Rice farmers in Biniwe State expect to harvest a lot more than two months after planting.
Some of them who were tapped in Makurdi expressed hope that the harvest would be at all times between October and November.
A small-scale farmer in Mbatiab-Gboko, Titus Atondo, said he planted his rice in a two-hectare area in July.
Atondo said he obtained seeds from the market in his area and was in two groups of CP and OC rice while using the Dazzle chemical to clear land for planting and fertilizer.
According to Titus Atondo, the challenges of growing rice in rural areas such as the mainland are many because we rely so much on labor as customers are unable to find farm roads.
Titus Atondo added that we are recruiting people to do farming from the ground up to the harvest, adding that this is exhausting and has a lot to do with.
Atondo said all of the money spent on his farm that is now included planting, clearing, application of modern fertilizer and is expected to be harvested at N2020000.
Titus Atondo went on to say that, however, he expected at least 50 sacks as a harvest from two acres that would probably be sold at a price of N29,000 per 100k bag.
It is also a large rice farmer, Bitalis Tarnongu, planted in June to July on 274 acres of the farm which the price stood at Naira 14,500 per hectare while the plot pays Naira 25,000 per hectare.
He planted 44 (Supi) and 61 (OC) seeds derived from the National Agricultural Council (NPC) and some derived from the company Olam Nigeria.
He added that the growth levels at this time are in different areas while others are in the grazing program, and others are the first stage of animal slaughter as farmed in the stages.
Tarnongu added that the challenges so far have included financials since the cost of producing the selected animals is high and the cost of labour has increased.
He said the harvest is expected to begin in October to November.
He added that the total price of the goods at the end of the day would be at least N246,000 per hectare while the production of three tonnes of honey, which could translate to N360,000 for N120 per kilogram, was expected.
Tarnongu does not use drugs on his rice farm, instead, he advises and implements traditional agriculture, adding that, therefore, we use insect-killing plants, insecticides and pharmaceutical fertilizers.
The President of the National Farmer's Association (AFAN) Benue State branch, Comrade Aondongu Saaku, also expressed the hope that this year's rainy season will be commensurate with the cultivation of large amounts of rice.
According to the President of the National Farmer's Association (AFAN) rehen Benue State, Comrade Aondongu Saaku, more farmers entered the rice farming business at the end of this year due to the Coronavirus crisis that prevented many people from leaving offices and staying on their farms.
He said that children will harvest 20 per cent of their production in 2019, which is estimated at more than one million tonnes.
According to him, the data collectors are currently taking statistics of different types of farmers and when the project is completed, the number of rice farmers in the state will be determined.
The Chairman of the National Farmer's Association (AFAN) Benue State branch, Comrade Aondongu Saaku who said, he cultivated three acres of rice, noted that some farmers planted rice in June while short-term farmers do so at the same time of harvest expected at the end of November or early December.
The AFAN president added that rice farmers use raw materials to kill aging plants, chemical compounds, and insecticides.
Expressing concern about the challenges of animals threatening rice cultivation, he added that farmers are making fences, placing ropes and clearing the farm edges to address the problem.

He also urged al-Ummah to continue to support the government in ending the epidemic and to pray for those who lost their lives.
He advised the public to hold prayers in the care of ways to protect themselves from COVID-19 infection.
The principles of self-defense established by the health authorities should continue to be adhered to, especially in the places of prayer.
"It's a time when I don't want to be able to get rid of them," Kano said.
Speaking from the outset, the State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Aminu Ibrahim Tsanjawa commended the state government for the protection measures it continues to take to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
In addition, the number of cases is declining, and various parts of governments and non-governmental organizations are commending the government's efforts in the fight against COVID-19.
Commenting during the meeting, Dr Kabiru Ibrahim Getso, the State Commissioner for Environment, said that, in addition to the stench they held in public and private ministries and businesses, they have now distributed more than a nose-and-mouth route of about 7000.

The liberal parties called our fellows also agreed to this process of bringing women into politics, starting with the issue of ticketing in the political parties, as the leader of those parties' allies, Malam Hambali Dodo, explained.
The re-examination of the electoral system under which elections are held in Niger is one of the requirements brought by the participants of this meeting, according to them as a way to enable them to prevent fraud.
However, this requirement did not materialize, as according to the Electoral Commission, any legal agreement at this time before the contest is initiated is against the law.
Opponents who continue to boycott all other security measures did not attend the meeting, a step related to the illegality that they said was contrary to the CENI electoral commission.
Local government elections are expected to be held on 13 December 2020 while the first round of the presidential and parliamentary elections will be held after just 2 weeks, 27th of the month.

Nigerian students in Cyprus have refuted Abike Dabire's claim that students are being murdered in the country.
Nigerian students studying in Cyprus, the TRCN, have lied to the Chairman of the Nigerian Overseas Residents Commission (NiDCOM), who warned their parents to stop sending their children to Northern Cyprus, she said they were being raped.
On Monday, Abike Dabiri-Erewa warned that hundreds of Nigerians were being killed in Northern Cyprus, without the country's government carrying out an investigation.
Dabiri made this claim after the story of the murder of a student named Ibrahim Khaleel.
A Nigerian student has been killed and no further information has been provided.
The murder of Abraham Khaleel would serve as a lesson for parents to stop sending their children to the world, who were killed in vain, especially in Northern Cyprus.
The problem is that people do not know that the whole world is not allowed to exist in Northern Cyprus.
The United Nations does not recognize the country.
But thousands of Nigerians live in their country of study, but hundreds of Nigerians are killed in the country.
He added that Nigeria will name the hundreds of Nigerians who have been massacred in the country.
However, as they reacted, Nigerian students studying in the country said, "Peace in Northern Cyprus is far more than Nigeria's.
The President of the Nigerian Association of Foreign Students (NANS), Evidence Akhayere, said that although Nigerian readers in their countries face challenges, the readers in Northern Cyprus are not faced with any problems, challenges or interference.
That's what he told Premium Times in their interview.
He said it was incorrect to say that hundreds of Nigerian students died in Cyprus.
He said the death of 100 students was false.
A few of those who have died are terminally ill, not fatal.

Zailani said this while speaking at the Kaduna Government Palace when the state government was hosting the head of the Christian Association of Nigeria who visited Kaduna last week.
"It's not the truth to be told, if you go to other places of worship, you hear their leaders inculcate them and support them in the hatred of their fellow believers who are not of the same religion.
This leads to conflict amongst the people.
Finally, he said that the religious leaders must be brought back together and teach the followers of God Almighty's message as it came in our religious books, there will be no peace.
Similarly, the senator representing Kaduna Central, Father Sani, who attended the meeting, urged non-Kaduna residents to refrain from speaking out.
The conflict has been raging for over 40 years.
For the first time, a heroic governor was found to have struck the sword until the end of this problem.

The film is full of songs by Beyonc<0xC3><0xA9>'s "Black is King," the Black Man King who continues to be praised and celebrated around the world, because of how he describes African culture.
In South Africa, where the 85-minute-long film was put together, many say it also surpassed the film.
Black is King, is a song-filled film directed by American singer-songwriter, Beyonc<0xC3><0xA9>, co-founder, co-creator, and producer.
The film is based on her song "The Lion King: The Gift," The Lion King: The Son of a Slave.
Bara is a film made in the United States, South and West Africa, and Europe, and features several African musicians.
This film, which was released in July, has been widely accepted by the audience, but there are also critics.
Some say Beyonce, who was born in Houston, Texas, has illegally labeled African characters, especially African-style characters in the film, although traditionally it has no roots on the African continent.
But in South Africa, it is also a joy for those who have played a part in making this film.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a student who reads the film, said he was named among the filmmakers.
He said the film impressed him.
The film contains a number of untrained elements of black history.
He said that when he saw the film he also first saw the story and the clothes she wore and the film's coverage, which resulted in many more things than was expected.
Beyonc<0xC3><0xA9> singer Kgosi Motosoane says Africans abroad - including black Americans - have the right to use what others see as African cultural goods.
Who's interested in the film?
Kgosi said that black women were more likely to be relegated to the national level in society.
Therefore, their development in such highly influential matters is encouraging.
As a film-reader, Mathebula said Beyonc<0xC3><0xA9>'s film made him interested in making the film in order to further disseminate information about Africa.
The Beyonc<0xC3><0xA9> fans of Affleck have fought for one thing: If Black Man is King, then Beyonc<0xC3><0xA9> is Queen.

Nigeria's Minister of Agaji and Jinkai Affairs, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouk, praised the efforts of the media, aid workers and cooperation agencies at the same time as the ministry's one-year anniversary.
It was created by President Muhammadu Buhari on August 21, 2019 to implement humanitarian policies and activities, to prevent disasters, to provide emergency relief, and then to run applications to assist the needy.
In a press release issued by the women's rights activist Halima Oyelade, the minister said that this year was a year of many events, of many challenges and interests, in which we learned ways to help the public and to take care of disasters, but not in all our efforts to prevent them.

At the same time as farmers were burning their crops in Nigeria, the farmers of the Sokoto State area began to struggle over the threat of birds to them, which could lead to obstacles to the expected harvests.
The Red Birds in the Sokoto State area are very happy to return, as evidenced by the arrival of a healthy food season in 2020.
Some local farmers must have embraced a traditional tactic to expel birds, according to a young man named Faruk from Dange Shuni.
Sambo Abubakar, one of the farmers in the area, said the birds are now chopping down all the plants that first harvested in the fields.
The head of the Nigeria Farmers Association, Sokoto State Branch, Murtala Gagado Minnata, said that two-thirds of Sokoto State is currently experiencing the problem.
He also said they are now waiting to hear the situation in the local government areas of the state to include a report to be sent to the State and Federal Ministry of Agriculture to take action to help farmers.
The official of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture in charge of the Department of Bird and Bird Medicine, Ya'u Makseri Kagara, said it was not more than a month after the completion of the bird flu vaccine in the Sokoto region.
He added that the birds are imported from the Republic of Niger and Benin, and the international business must have an agreement before the problem can be resolved jointly.
In June, the federal government launched a bird-killing operation in the 12 states of northern Nigeria that are neighbouring and foreign to which the birds are now entering Nigeria.
However, the return of this problem may turn the hand of the grandfather back to the development seen in agriculture that governments claim is giving him special attention.

Germany's response to the Coronavirus
Angela Merkel is a supporter of a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50, N22,000, tax levy for anyone who has been arrested without a public face-to-face mask.
There is a need to reduce the number of people at home and abroad.
The prime minister said he supported the Minister of Health who needed to stop free testing of the virus for returnees travelling abroad.
In the past, Germany has managed to cope with the pandemic, but with the withdrawal of the laws made earlier this year, new cases of the disease are now frequent.
The introduction of the new COVID-19 support policy in the United States will be announced.
While the figures show that the number of people infected with COVID-19 continues to increase in the United States, on Monday, Republicans in the Senate are expected to present a bill of support.
It is estimated that the aid will cost <0x24>1 trillion to ease the strain caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the country.
The program is coming days before the end of the first-ever funding deadline for millions of Americans who have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On Sunday, after days of discussions with Republicans in the National Assembly, the head of the U.S. government's Palace staff, Mark Meadows, and Secretary of the Treasury-Mali Steven Mnuchin said the grant included an expansion of the funding scheme for those who lost their jobs.
But according to them, this time, Americans will see 70 percent of the money given in the past.
On Friday, the first subsidy deadline will end for those who have been paid a certain amount of money and donated <0x24>600 per week to those who have lost their jobs.
"Republicans complain that this scheme means that some people who are being paid receive higher amounts than those who are being paid during their employment, when combined with federal government and state-paying subsidies.
"Democrats, on the other hand, have challenged this trend by saying that while the coronavirus pandemic is on the rise, some workers are not safe enough to get back to work.
Why did I go back to the APC after leaving the PDP?
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives of Nigeria Yakubu Dogara explained the reasons for his re-election from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the APC after the incumbent leader of Mai Mala Buni announced his return to their party.
In his letter to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in his Bogoro constituency, Rekara said the collapse of the leadership in his state of Bauchi under the government of Bala Muhammed that helped him succeed was why he left the party.
He couldn't be trusted to open his mouth to question how the state government is run until he was accused of disobedience, so he took the shoes to say leave the party.
The former Speaker of the House said if he took his hand in the fight that anything about how things are happening in Bauchi State under the government of Bala Muhammed would be disloyal, after Governor Isa Yuguda and Mohammed Abubakar heard everyone's voice to express his opinion if it went wrong.
The federal government has launched an agricultural program for food production and employment.
The Federal Government has launched the Agriculture Program for Food Production and Employment (AFGP), which is part of the Economic Sustainability Assurance Program.
The plan is designed to reduce the number of people living with the Coronavirus.
This information came from the Minister of Agriculture, Sabo Nanono, during the launch of the program in Katsina.
A statement by the Ministry of Agriculture's Press Spokesperson, Ezeaja Ikemefuna, was issued on Thursday.
The plan will address the lives of people affected by the coronavirus pandemic in the country and around the world.
The program will also increase the inspiration for farmers' ways of food development, rehabilitation and transportation in Nigeria.
According to the minister, the launch event represents more than 1,100,000 small farmers across the country.
He said these numbers of over 1,100,000 smallholder farmers were in the Farmers Group under 6 companies including AFE<0x58>, BabanGona, Value Seeds, Universal, Thrive Agric and Oxfam.
Soon we will be discussing the second group of B, of those who will benefit from this agricultural program.
Nanono recalled President Muhammadu Buhari's establishment of the Committee for the Protection and Promotion of the Economy from the Disability He suffered after the Coronavirus outbreak.
He said one of the ways to revive the country's economy, including the AFJP Programme, with the plan to boost agriculture from being a hand-to-hand food aggregator to modern and food-rich.
He said the plan included a plan by the government to distribute food metric tons of food up to 100,000 for a plan to remove the underprivileged from food shortages and hunger during the outbreak of the coronavirus.
He said that within one year, the project will be expected to reach 5 million to 10 million young people.

There is a need for people to know the 2019 Rule of Law - KCSF.
The association of civil society NGOs in Kano State, the Kano Civil Society Forum (KCSF), with the cooperation of the European Union, the British Council, the Association for the Promotion of Culture, and the Association for the Prevention of Corruption and Corruption of Human Rights in 2019.
The meeting, which took place at the Aminu Kano Center for Democracy and Expansion Research in Mumbayya, looked at the new rules and how their management system is for the community organized by civil society groups in Kano 150 and journalists.
Addressing the chief presenter of the article, Dr. Noah Musa Idris, of Bayero University's legal teaching department in Kano, commented on some of the more complex laws.
He called for a review of some of the ageing laws that resulted in the legalization of travel and modernity.
In his remarks, the Chairman of the Kano State Civil Society Federation (KCSF) Ibrahim Waya, said the lack of knowledge of the laws played a major role in the exercise of the rights of the community and why they needed to be known as they are.
Some participants of the event which was the third such event organized, in three Kano Senatorial Zones, from civil society organizations described how they viewed the legislative process and their message.
Our representative Aminu Halilu Tudunwada, who attended the televised conference, told us that the problems of some of the broken laws against which the community is facing are being discussed.
Those who often do not know their rights over them, being the law has over 400 rules, which have made additional phone calls.
The New Registration of Places of Worship Law is being debated in Nigeria.
The SERAP, a campaign for human rights and economic development known as SERAP, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to decry the Nigerian Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami and the Executive Director of the Board of Trustees to stop the plan to start the registration of religious sites.
According to SERAP, this step is a violation of human rights as enshrined in the Nigerian constitution.
Before the human rights groups complained about this step of government, various religious leaders had already complained to the Buhari administration that the bill should be reinstated for review and approval by the House of Representatives, so that it would not violate the constitutional right to religious freedom.
Pastor John Buro, a Christian president in Kaduna State, told a U.S. representative that the law was unfounded if the government sought to ban worship or impose sanctions.
It should only take advantage of the means by monitoring and tracking all lawbreakers without enacting a new law.
On his part, Dr Bashir Yankuzo, a clergyman at Minna's University of Science, said that although there was no fault in the government's monitoring of companies and organizations for national security, this did not mean that it was determined to allow the freedom of anyone or anyone else to be undermined.
Now it's time to see if the government is going to listen to this.
How Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has tried to deactivate the PREMIUM TIMES website.
Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has sponsored a hacker's website, to crash the PREMIUM TIMES website, Nigeria's leading online newspaper.
This online hacker has done all the tricks that hackers on people's websites follow to access their sites, but has failed.
He began experimenting with "hacking" since February 28, dumping his weapons on the campus of the University, and carrying out his attacks using "data" of the University.
On the other hand, if he tries to infiltrate the PREMIUM TIMES database with the computer, he attacks another GSM phone.
Five days later, the cursor closed the door to the main site of the PREMIUM TIMES, but it was unsuccessful, despite the fact that it used various modern weapons.
He did not succeed in the infiltration, as the university did not know that the newspaper PREMIUM TIMES had a copy of its own plan, which had built the project and the bridge as the door that a farmer had opened was not enough to break.
PREMIUM also has a number of security officers on the site of the modern Internet giant including the King of the Battle of PREMIUM TIMES and the Greater Dakare, the Web Protection of PREMIUM TIMES.
These security agents have the modern experience of crushing any cluster of compounds or any other barden that has sought to cuddle it alone, or to certify - as soon as possible - the attempt to break into the PREMIUM TIMES database.
The following are some of the ways in which the Internet of Things allows you to access the Internet of Things:
At 8:00 a.m., he started to ride with the fire at the front door of the Premium Times, to see how he was going to make the horn-wave burst into it, smashing the stack completely.
Failing to succeed the next night, and the next morning, at 6:15 p.m., he tested the clock again, this time using the "WPScan", which is being done to detect the strengths or weaknesses of the security measures of adult websites such as PREMIUM TIMES.
90 minutes later he began to infiltrate the power of the modern computer technology, that is, the "custom script".
The next morning, he made every effort to lock up the Premium Times site completely.
How a Farmer Treats the City Bar:
This hacker did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had confiscated small-scale rats and large-scale metropolitan areas that were entering the fields of their modern social networking sites to infiltrate or hijack the site of the squirrel.
This lack of knowledge is why all of the props he has used, all of which are old catchers that can't harm PREMIUM TIMES.
On that day, he suffered in vain and was tired of being followed by an attack by DDOS at the NTP Likau Radiation, an ancient method used since the village of Kano.
On March 3, he did all the tricks that were left in his mind and mind, but all were unsuccessful.
This attempt to break the door of the PREMIUM TIMES General Staff came just days after PREMIUM TIMES published the story of a comparison between President Muhammadu Buhari's Advisor on the Security Front, Babagana Monguno and the former Chief of Staff of the Presidential Palace, the late Abba Monguno.
Some members of the Federal University of Technology in Akure have deceived PREMIUM TIMES that the university has recruited a number of high-profile rats on Internet sites to attack PREMIUM TIMES, destroy it, or destroy it.
However, when she contacted the University of FUTA, she distanced herself from this attempt to hit the Internet's main premium times.
She said that unless she was the only person in the class to be a student, she wouldn't be able to do it.

Yoruba leaders have threatened to curtail the 2023 election.
Leaders of Yoruba groups in Nigeria have threatened to boycott the 2023 national elections, as long as their request to change the country's constitution is "restructuring."
The Yoruba groups vowed in the document after the meeting, saying that only a change in Nigeria's constitution would save the country from a difficult situation, especially in terms of security and the economy.
The leaders who attended the joint event included the leader of Afenifere pa Reuben Fashonanti, Professor Banji Akintoye, chairman of Yoruba World Congress and former Ondo State Governor Dr Olusegun Mimiko.

While the Kano State government reduced its annual budget by about N70 billion due to the severe impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the state economy, the State House of Assembly passed a new law to regulate the state government's financial management system.
However, the city's presidential hope groups say that the issue of creating a law is a simple matter, but its implementation is a challenge.
The creation of a new approach to the management of government funds based on a democratic system is one of the objectives of the new law in Kano State, which has been developed in recent years at the federal level as well as in other Nigerian states.
The majority leader of the Kano State House of Assembly, Honorabul Kabiru Hassan Dashi, told the Voice of the United States that the law would give ministers and the state government a theory of how to spend their money, and how the state would spend its money.
The city's state legislature has now approved the legislation, as long as it is reviewed regularly.
The director of the Kano State-based Organization for Community Civic Engagement, Comrade Abdulrazak Alkali, said he hoped government officials and the state government would implement the law in a timely manner.
But Kano State Commissioner for Finance and Economic Affairs, Alhaji Shehu Na'Allah, said they were well prepared for the implementation of the law.
Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje signed the new law last weekend and is expected to come into force soon.

The way Ganduje converted the princes that King Ado and Sanusi had expelled, he would make them king-appointed rulers in Kano.
Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje wants the Kano State House of Assembly to amend the state law of 2019, as well as to ensure the appointment of some of the two major emirates of Kano and the late King Ado Bayero and King Sanusi, in such a way that the state law will ensure their appointment as chief appointees to the Emir.
Kano Speaker Abdullahi Gafasa has read Ganduje's request in front of the assembly, and they are expected to discuss the matter before the end of July.
The returned rulers of the Kano kingdom were Aminu the Great Prince and, who made the King of Dawaki the Tutor and Ciroman Kano, Sanusi Ado-Bayero.
Both of them were removed by the king and King Muhammadu Sanusi on suspicion of conspiracy.
The elder son challenged him to be impeached in court.
For 17 years, the Supreme Court has ruled that he has been acquitted.
He also wanted Ganduje to be restored to his throne, and the law was amended to be among the king's appointees in the Kano kingdom.
Ado Bayero removed the bandi in 2003 after he was found guilty of conspiracy and acting in the political arena.
A committee was set up to investigate him, but he was invited to refuse to appear before the committee in order to defend himself.
He then challenged his removal at the Kano State High Court up to the Supreme Court.
Prior to the Supreme Court, the Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the Grand Aminu should be returned to his seat.
But Kano's kingdom under the rule of Muhammadu Sanunmsi II, was elevated, with the Supreme Court emphasizing the removal of him as Chief of the East, and the King of Dawaki the Warrior, on 5 June.
After Sanusi Bayero was deposed, Ciroman Kano for refusing to accept the Emir of Kano appointed Muhammadu Sanusi II in June, 2014.
He was later appointed Chairman of the National Ports Authority in Jonathan's day.
He was appointed Wamban Kano, under the current Emir of Kano.

It's hard to be honest with yourself, and it's in the heart of the world. - The New York Times
In the Longyuan village of the Hongsipu region of the city of Wuzhong in Ningxia state of the Hui Autonomous Community, in the northwestern part of China.
A devout woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (Islamic name) is famous for her struggles in life and her success in trying to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that the effort and perseverance to pursue oneself is a matter of the heart.
At first, Li Yaomei or Sadiya, she had never been in class with the intention of taking a lesson, a situation that made her unable to read more text.
But God gave her a gift of wisdom and skill and a wealth of knowledge, so that she was an example in the field of war and poverty.
About 20 years ago, Madame Li Yaomei suffered from cervical cancer, leading her to undergo surgery including three times.
After her recovery again, she encountered a serious accident, now she is walking with the metal placed in her leg.
These challenges have left her in a difficult state of health, and even with the issue of a cure, why she received a loan of about 300,000 yuan, comparable to more than N16 million.
Surprisingly, this challenge faced by Professor Sadiya became a way to inspire and bully her in order to see her improve her life.
In addition, the Chinese government's support has increased her confidence.
The purpose of the project is to create a variety of applications based on the use of
Due to her husband's efforts, her sister's profession has grown considerably, with various ministries giving her the order to move.
In addition, she created a number of machines that help her simplify the process.
For example, it took about 15 minutes to connect a single large bulb, but now in this time, it will connect up to 5 bulbs.
In addition, it has developed additional machines that clean the grass that it restores brooms.
There is also an additional machine that cleans women's animal feed, and these machines are still sold to applicants.
Seeing the challenges that Teacher Sadiya faces, and the efforts she continues to make to improve her and her employees' lives, it will be understood that the applicant must be with the achievement.
The fight against poverty and the improvement of life is not something that depends on the government.
If the government continues to provide support, but the people have no incentive or desire to improve their lives by seeking jobs based on their situation, then only the advances will be made without the achievement of a goal.
Her story shows that running a business or earning job doesn't require any major funding or travel to other cities or countries abroad.
Because she considered her environment, she used the resources available in her environment to improve her life.
Moreover, the teacher Sadiya carried out these tasks on the basis of standing on her feet without relying on her husband, in order to run away from her.
That is to say, the effort and commitment to self-seeking is something that is in the heart.
He then demonstrated the strength of women to change their lives and stand on their feet without asking for someone else's help.
This is also a lesson that shows that, whatever one does, one should stand on one's foot, because one's trust is uncertain.
In fact, Professor Sadiya was a devout, intelligent and virulent teacher who became an example and a model for the rest of society.
Also, by March of this year, Teacher Sadiya had completed the payment of all outstanding debts, and then stopped receiving government support on its own.

U.S. policymakers are worried about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic - The Washington Post.
Recently, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed concern over the measures being taken by some countries to preserve the COVID-19 respiratory vaccines that are hoped to be produced, stating that priority should be avoided when vaccines are being distributed to different countries.
And the vaccine should be distributed in a suitable way across the globe, as this would suit the great benefits of different countries.
Indeed, some U.S. politicians are pursuing the goal of prioritizing their own well-being, on the sharing of vaccines, as well as impairing international cooperation in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide has already exceeded 23 million.
In addition, more than 800,000 people lost their lives as a result of the disease.
Under such a severe situation, there is an increased focus on the impact of the vaccine, and the joy is that, in recent days, there have been significant results in the study of the vaccine in some countries, a situation that has produced skin, and a belief in the participation of the international community as a whole.
Sadly, however, some U.S. politicians have expressed their desire to take the vaccine.
Even "Science" magazine has clarified that the U.S. government has already ratified agreements to buy COVID-19 vaccines worth more than <0x24>6 billion, from several pharmaceutical companies.
Although the U.S. government's goal has been understood, being the U.S. leader in the spread of the disease, other developing countries also need vaccines, checking that they are more vulnerable to lack of health resources.
The Ecologist magazine also pointed out that, if the U.S. achieves its goal of getting the vaccine to be produced, then the number of vaccines to be produced in developing countries will decrease.
Mr. John Nkengasong, director-general of the African Centre for Disease Control (CDC), also expressed concern over the issue.
As some daily commentators have pointed out, even if the vaccine has been successfully produced, it is not possible to achieve the goal of seeing after the disease, until the distribution of the vaccine is planned, which is an extremely important issue for the international community.
It is important for the international community to strengthen their cooperation.
The WHO Director-General Tedros also pointed out that, if the pandemic is to be seen after the pandemic, it must be blocked from all facets around the world, and that it is not possible for some parts of the world, or a few countries, to achieve recovery from the effects of the pandemic alone.

You have been accused by the Buhari administration of accompanying Father Kyari's body to his grave in court.
A Nigerian culpable petitioner has told you of all the leaders of President Muhammadu Buhari's government who accompanied the corpse of Father Kyari.
Kyari, who is the Chief of Staff of the Presidential Palace, was buried at the Fuda Cemetery in Abuja on April 18, after he died of coronavirus.
Prosecutor Tope Akinyade told you about them at the Magistrate's Court in Kado, Abuja, where he asked the court to punish them for violating the lockdown law at home imposed by the federal government at the time.
He said there was serious injustice for Nigerians who were arrested and punished during mandatory house arrests, but also for some groups of people who broke the law, none of them were punished.
He said that if Buhari's administration of justice were to be upheld, he did not see why the poor should be prosecuted and arrested if they broke the Corona Law.
Some of the government's bodies also broke the law but were allowed to.
Among those whom Tope has courted to you are the Secretary of the Federal Government, Boss Mustapha, Minister of Transportation, Hadi Sirika, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, Minister of Agaji and Jinkai Affairs, Sadiya Umar.
There is also the Press Secretary of the Presidential Palace, Garba Shehu, Social Media Media Officer, Bashir Ahmed, President Buhari's Security Advisor, Babagana Monguno, Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu and several other members of the government.
Justice Celestine Odo asked to show that the plaintiff had made a mistake since the plaintiffs had not signed their application.
However, Tope reminded the judge that he had brought the case directly to court, not to follow up with the police.
He said it was the duty of the jury to send all the petitioners to participate.
He did what Nigeria's law gave him the right to do in court.
The judge adjourned the case, saying he would return to the court on August 4 to continue hearing.

According to the statement made by the party's leader, Prince Uche Secondus, it is clear that they would want the president to stop the investigation but to cover things up.

Students were abducted by gunmen in Chukun Local Government Area, Kaduna.
Local communities in Udawan, Chukun Local Government Area, said that in addition to six students writing the stolen WEAC exam, there were also people who had spent months not being released.

The House of Commons said that the whole world is not a place where hatred has led to success, and that there should be reconciliation with them, by improving the lives of pastoralists, i.e., the provision of grazing, schools, drinking water and health care.

But this war will not be born in this land with the Son of Man, for all of them are citizens of this land, reconciliation is the right way.
And he will do it with the best of intentions and peace will be achieved.
We are not going to be affected
Our children and grandchildren will live in the future, and this is a big problem.
There has never been a war on the earth with a pistol that was finished with a pistol, and it is settled on a table.
Security experts say that the terrorists are not being reconciled, this is a dirty advice, because even if America says it is not making peace with the terrorists, they are not their own terrorists, they are being attacked by the people of another country.
We, too, are members of the armed forces, and they are not to be reconciled.
