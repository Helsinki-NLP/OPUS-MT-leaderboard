Rapidly increasing cumulative number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK, confirming that although the phase varies based on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness to increase the number of COVID-19 patients who will need healthcare, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown pathogens were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent, the novel coronavirus, is now referred to as SARS-COV-2-associated acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that nearly 80 percent of people with COVID-19 have mild illness, a respiratory infection with or without symptoms, and most recover.
In about 14%, COVID-19 has been exacerbated to a more severe disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% suffer from a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 was about 4%.
In this study, we assess trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19s in each country in the EU/EEA and UK (UK) and compare them with those from Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK
After what happened in China, COVID-19 has increasingly spread geographically and follows the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world today.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance issue of 5 March 2020, Spetieri and others reported the first confirmed European COVID-19 cases as defined by the World Health Organization.
In the European Union/European Economic Area, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 to persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) as between 31 December 2019 and this date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Acquisition of the cumulative number and average of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of reported COVID-19 cases in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health bodies and the World Health Organization, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to those in Italy.
As a measure of the prevalence of COVID-19 active cases, we calculated the cumulative number of intermittent COVID-19 cases within 14 days, thus taking into account the normal course of COVID-19, in all EU/EEA and UK countries, between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also provided the cumulative number of reported cases from each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m., compared to the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK
Trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases cut over a 14-day period in EU/EEA and UK countries followed those of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative number of COVID-19s started to increase around 21 February, and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (supplementary material).
This was often driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all EU/EEA and UK countries showed similar increases to the cumulative number of COVID-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK compared to Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
As of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., a further 15 EU/EEA and UK countries reported the total number of cases already comparable to that found in Italy just 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends observed in the cumulative number of COVID-19 indicate that the pandemic is escalating at a similar speed in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, despite different national public health responses, and the possibility of different state definitions in countries and different protocols to select patients who should be tested to confirm their COVID-19 status, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described the situation where about 10 percent of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospital admissions and/or intensive care units for COVID-19 cases are currently available at the EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, they need to be compiled in a systematic manner to complement existing surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed a great diversity in the availability of intensive care and middle-care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds per 100,000 people in 2010–11).
Modeling scenarios associated with the saturation of healthcare capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA and UK country for the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with a 90% risk of overcapacity of intensive care beds, are available in the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention’s (ECD) 6th Rapid Risk Assessment Update.
Since cases that have been collected so far in certain regions of the EU/EEA and UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve specific regional populations, it is preferable to provide case information and intensive care beds at the level of the NTS-2 (Regional Units of Statistics) designation.
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly escalating in the EU/EEA and the UK.
States, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare themselves for a sustainable community-based SARS-CoV-2 transition scenario and increase the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care, especially intensive care, such as in the affected areas of Italy.
As outlined in the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention's Rapid Risk Assessment, a proactive, comprehensive, rapid approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2 with the transition from containment to mitigation, as the rapid increase in the number of cases expected may not provide decision makers and hospitals with sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a limited opportunity for countries to step up their regulatory efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere, causing a humanitarian disaster.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus, similar to its similar virus, SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of people to become infected with SARS in 2003, can also move from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower risk and mortality rate than SARS but is more transmissible and influential among older adults than younger men and men than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications related to emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive and timely review on the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will address the basics of the disease’s epidemiology, its causes, its virology, its diagnosis, treatment, prediction of disease progression, and prevention.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope this review will help to understand and eliminate the disease that poses a threat.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and unforgettable anniversary for all Chinese who were urged to stay indoors throughout the holiday period and for many weeks thereafter due to an emerging viral disease outbreak.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (COV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, it was named SARS-COV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease associated with CoV-19 (COV-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country, as well as nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has led to 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospitals and more than 3,000 patients dying.
The World Health Organization warns that COVID-19 is “public enemy number one” and potentially stronger than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 researches on COVID-19 have been published, including the virology of the disease, its epidemiology, its causes, its diagnosis, and its treatment, since the release of the first report on January 7, 2020, which identified the sequencing of many patients from the isolated virus.
This review aims at summarizing the research progress in the new and rapidly evolving subject area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another Cove-induced disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding disease prevention and prediction as well as some pressing questions that remain to be asked.
Coronaviruses are usually considered non-lethal pathogens in humans and have mainly caused about 15% of the 4 common colds.
However, in this century, we faced severe disease-causing coronaviruses in humans twice, SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and the disease quickly spread to many other countries at a terrifying rate of spread and death.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of the coronavirus in recorded human history.
As shown in figure 1.1, groups with an unidentified pneumonia were first reported by Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to China’s National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the death of the first case.
Meanwhile, the epidemic has spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, cases of infection were reported among health care providers, suggesting that the disease could be transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was closed with all public transportation shut down.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients were in direct contact with the Wuhan Seafood Market, which considered the site of infection initiation from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and around 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation develops rapidly, the final scope and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, provided a more up-to-date explanation of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all age groups, but mainly injured people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) were over 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected a larger number of men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has expanded among groups mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of infection to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average injury time from infancy to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproduction number (basic reproduction number) was 3.77 (confidence range 95%: 3.51-4.05), and the modified primary reproduction number was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons has increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, in line with the many travel operations ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate among confirmed patients was 1.44% (confidence range is 95%: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate per patient was 3.06% (confidence range is 95%: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and acute pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a class of large, laminated viruses that contain single-chain positive-directional ribose DNA genomes.
They can be divided into four genera, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, and it is known that the coronaviruses of the genus Alpha and Beta infect humans.
The S-coated fork of the diabetic protein binds to its cellular receptors, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dibitidyl-peptidase 4 (DPB4) of SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV, respectively, then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is cloned, the genomic RNA is formed along with glucocorticoids and nucleated capsicle proteins containing ferions, and they fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus afterwards.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new beta-CoV species with a genetic identity exceeding 99.98% among 10 sequencing samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market Bohan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more like SARS-CoV than SARS-CoV.
An electron microscopy of transmission revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is present in very thin sections of the human airway epithelium.
The human angiotensin-2 converting enzyme was found to be a receptor for SARS-COV-2 as well as SARS-COV.
However, the S protein of SARS-COV-2 is associated with the human angiotensin-2 converting enzyme weaker than SARS-COV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-COV.
SARS-COV-2 can also form a short neural protein encoded by orf3b and an excreted protein encoded by orf8.
Orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and limit IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any range or pattern with a known function.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported the full-length structure of the angiotensin-2-transformed human enzyme under a 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> ultra-cold electron microscope in a compound with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They discovered that the compound, which had open and closed structures, had been assembled to form a demarcation and that ACE2-B0AT1 could bind S proteins, providing evidence of coronavirus and infection.
Sodium-based neutral amino acid transporter may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-COV-2 infection.
Original Host and Intermediate Host
Sars-Cove and Mers-Cove have been known to have emerged from bats and been transmitted to humans via yogurt and camel cats, respectively.
By comparing the strain development of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were considered the original hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with the new virus matching 96% with two SARS-like viruses from bats called bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>45 and bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross the interfamily barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission has not yet been clarified.
Gi et al. suggested snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans, which involved a symmetrical recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that squamous ant-eaters — long-tongue ant-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine — are the potential intermediate host of SARS-COV-2 based on 99% genetic symmetry in the SARV-2 virus detected in ant-eating ants.
However, the 1% difference spread across genomes is still significant; therefore, we await conclusive results with concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-Cove and Mers-Cove can survive in the lab for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and humidity between 40% and 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-COV-2 is reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; it can ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, pyroacetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not effectively chlorohexidine.
The entire human race generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so they are more likely to be infected with the new virus.
Currently, there is no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies concerning other coronaviruses, notably SARS-COV, and MERS-COV (Figure 4).
Generally, after a host virus is invaded, it is recognized by the natural immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRS), including type C receptors that are similar to lactine, tlr-like receptors, receptors that are similar to the nucleotide binding particulate range (nlr), and receptors similar to the trl-i.
Through different pathways, the virus induces the emergence of inflammatory agents, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the large phagocytic cells of viral antigens.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
The adaptive immune response soon joins the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce dedicated antibodies to the virus, and CD8<0x2B> T cells directly kill the cells infected with the virus.
Auxiliary T cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help the defending cells.
However, the coronavirus can reduce T-cell function by inducing programmed T-cell death.
Mixture immunity, including complementary proteins such as C3a, C5a and antibodies, is also essential in the fight against viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovering Mercer-Cove patient were neutralized.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of free radicals locally that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, at worst, failure in multiple organ functions and death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which initially appeared in groups, is more likely to affect older people with multiple diseases and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function has been damaged to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated average SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is 1-14 days, or mostly 3-7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period averaged 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing people who are infected but have no symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people exposed to or infected with the virus are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Do I have to extend the quarantine period to 24 days?
Fever is often the main and primary symptom of COVID-19, and may not be accompanied by any symptoms or other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasal spleen, chest pain, feeling sick, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxia of blood one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients developed rapidly to suffer from acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or severe respiratory symptoms and fever should be screened, even without an imaging that reveals the presence of pulmonary abnormalities, for an early diagnosis of the virus.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath, and 3% for diarrhea; and 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a group of family and a group to which the infection was transmitted from a person who did not show symptoms.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with Mears-Cove also experienced fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80 percent of them needed much more respiratory support than COVID-19 patients and were consistent with a higher mortality rate for MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with merce.
In SARS patients, fever (99%–100%), dry cough (29%–75%), shortness of breath (40%–42%), diarrhea (20–25%), and sore throat (13–25%) were the most important symptom, and respiratory support was needed for about 14%–20% of patients.
By 14 February, the death rate due to COVID-19 was 2%, while confirmed cases were 66,576 globally.
By comparison, the SARS mortality rate by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For Mears, the mortality rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic study conducted in June 2012.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2’s primary reproduction number was as high as 6.47 with a 95% CI range of 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV’s primary reproduction number ranged from just 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV and SARS-COV in terms of their specific symptoms, mortality rate, and primary reproduction number is shown in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-COV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than that of Mercer's-CoV and SARS's-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, the SARS-COV-2 epidemic is much more difficult to control than the SARS-COV and SARS-COV epidemics.
The onset of the disease often occurs in groups in the same family or from the same grouping or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of traveling to or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas, or of contacting people or patients during the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks, and recovering patients who have been discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, sending an alarm to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or low number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphocyte deficiency was detected with a white blood cell count of 4 <0xC3><0x97> 109 liter including lymphocyte count of 1 <0xC3><0x97> 109 liter, elevated levels of aspartate amin transport and blood secretion in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver, muscle and myoglobin enzymes in the blood of some patients increased, the C-reactive protein increased and the rate of irritation in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe conditions, the level of D-dimer, which is caused by fibrin breakage in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Impairments in radiography appear in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by double patch shadows or glazed opacity in the lungs.
Patients sometimes experience atypical pneumonia, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, out-of-control inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
The functional dysfunction of type 1 and type 2 pulmonary cells reduces the level of surface activator and increases surface tension, thus, reduces the ability of the lungs to dilate and increases the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the worst chest <0x58>-ray results are often compared to the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pulmonary cell scavenging, the formation of the hyalin membrane, interstitial lymph nodes, and multiple nucleic cellular cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, in line with the pathology of viral infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through the polymerase chain reaction of reverse transcription (PTBCR) has been used as a key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negative results, which could accelerate the epidemic, the use of clinical manifestations of diagnosis (which is no longer individually dependent on RTPCR) began in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of a history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiograph discoveries are essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Chang Group described a protocol to use CRISPR-based Sherlock technology to detect SARS-COV-2, and it detects pieces of SARS-COV-2-created RNA at a rate of 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L (less than 10–100 copies per <0xCE><0xBC>L) of input.
We hope the new technology will be able to significantly improve sensitivity and suitability if verified in clinical samples.
Due to a lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors are able to provide supportive care mainly for COVID-19 patients, while experimenting with a variety of treatments that have previously been used or proposed to treat other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, stimulants, plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovering patients has been suggested to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially, and may also, to a lesser extent, attack other organs that emit the angiotensin-2 converting enzyme, such as the digestive tract, intestines, and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the most serious threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Respiratory support is therefore essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, non-invasive respirators, and invasive artificial respirators based on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a heart-lung bypass technique used to treat life-threatening heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining a fluid balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-COV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storm results from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals and are the main cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure.
Immune suppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for acute patients.
Anabolic hormones, tosilizumab, and an anti-interleukin 6 monoclonal antibody were used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include modification of the T-cell-guided immune response; blockade of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of Janus Kinase; plinatomab; suppression of cytokine 4 signals; and histon decitylase inhibitors.
Steroids and immunosuppressants have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids in larger doses were not beneficial with severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it may cause severe side effects, especially angiogenic bone necrosis, which severely affects the prediction of disease progression.
However, short cycles of stimulant hormones in doses ranging from small to medium doses have been recommended with caution for critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no antiretroviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, it was found that intravenous administration of remdisifier, a nucleotide analogue, was effective with an American COVID-19 patient.
Rimdicevir is a novel antiviral that was initially developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, Remedycifer also showed a potential inhibition of other single-chain ribosome DNA viruses, including the Mers and SARS virus.
Based on these viruses, Gilliad provided the compound to China to conduct some trials on individuals with SARS-COV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, Parisitinib, Interferon-Alpha, Lubinavir/Retonavir and Ribavirin have been proposed as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used with patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovering patients and antibody generation
Collecting blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from developing the disease has a long history.
Indeed, recovering patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (IG) produced by B-lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize and neutralize molecules that are unique to pathogens directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients with serious conditions.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation, viral loads and improved blood oxygen saturation.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to introduce this method for widespread use before specific treatments can be found.
In addition, due to therapeutic effects, some of the defects associated with plasma need to be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can induce an overstimulating immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is likely to be life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for the treatment of critically ill patients.
Specific antibodies are difficult to develop and produce quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, isolating B-cells from recovering patients and identifying genetic codes that encode effective antibodies, or screening for effective antibodies against the virus’s core proteins, is more decisive and practical.
This way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend heavily on a combination of multiple components in a combination that differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most of the active ingredients remain unknown or ambiguous as they are difficult to extract and check for these ingredients or their optimal compositions.
Today, due to the lack of an effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the effectiveness of Shu Feng Ji Do and Lian Hua King Win capsules for the treatment of COVID-19 have been discovered.
The highest cure rates for COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China where 87% of its patients used traditional Chinese medicine, including Ganzhou (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used only traditional Chinese medicine with about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a very approximate comparison, as many other influence factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their conditions, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Poly Zhang and his co-workers published a study to compare Western Medicine (WM) treatment alone with the combined treatment of Western and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that the durations needed to recover from hyperthermia, symptom relief, and hospital stay were much shorter in the Western <0x2B> Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment range compared to the Western Medicine only treatment range.
More impressively, the worsening rate of symptoms (ranging from mild to severe) was much lower in the Western <0x2B> Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment group compared to the Western Medicine treatment group only (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the Western <0x2B> Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment group compared to only the Western Medicine treatment group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine still await further well-studied trials on larger scale and in more centers.
It will also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of procedures and to clarify the effective components of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 often feel intense fear of a highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people under quarantine feel bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as the negative effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by stimulant hormones, can lead to more anxiety and mental disorder.
In the first stage of the SARS outbreak, a range of mental illnesses were reported including permanent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies.
Obligatory contact and quarantine tracking, as part of public health responses to COVID-19 outbreaks, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization of their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people suspected of having COVID-19, people in contact, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the creation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear contacts with regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact with each other.
Effective vaccines to cut the chain of transmission of the virus from animal warehouses and infected humans to prone hosts are necessary and often complementary to antiviral therapy in the fight against epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-based vaccines to generate neutral, effective, long-term antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for the treatment of SARS.
However, the effectiveness of these in vivo candidate vaccines in older adults and lethal challenge models and in preventing them from contracting an animal-source virus infection was not identified prior to the start of a clinical study.
That’s probably because SARS faded 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
By contrast, sporadic BMR cases and groups continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of animal resources in endemic areas.
Immunization strategies against MERS were developed using inactive virus, hypoxic RNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and subunits of recombinant protein, some of which were evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming the difficulty is a challenge because of the length of time (average 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic changes of the coronavirus.
COVID-19, as a novel disease, has just begun to show its full clinical course through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without punishment.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high prevalence rates and mortality in severe patients.
Building a disease-prognosis model is essential for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-limited areas.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may influence or be related to the progression of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for predicting the progression of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
Age groups aged 30 to 65 were primarily infected with COVID-19, with 47.7% of these patients aged 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to develop underlying comorbidities and complications and were much older than those who did not need them (average age 66 versus 51), indicating age as a predictive factor for COVID-19 patient outcomes.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Accompanying diseases and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from severe heart injuries and irregular heartbeats.
Heart accidents were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-COV-2 can also be associated with positive biliary cells with the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, which may lead to liver dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and may overlap with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and is suggested to be a predictive factor of disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.
It was also suggested that the correlation between the level of the C-reactive protein and the severity of COVID-19 disease and its progression projections.
In addition, a rise in lactate-hydrogen-dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate-aminotransmitter (AST), alanine-aminotransmitter enzyme (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes appear strongly in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional signs of heart or liver dysfunctions.
Main clinical symptoms: Thoracography and the progression of clinical symptoms should be taken into account together with other problems to predict the results of COVID-19 and its complications.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are commonly used as an adjuvant treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high-dose anabolic steroid hormones are widely used in SARS patients, many survivors have suffered angioplasty with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, low-dose and short-term steroids should be used in COVID-19 patients, if necessary.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients experienced exceptional stress; they often endured long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close family members and sick colleagues.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help those patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological features than SARS.
In addition to reincarnation in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively reincarnate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stage of infection, similar to other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during daily activities, making it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission was considered to occur when patients were in a severe condition, while most of the virus transmissions did not occur at the early stage.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Hard work is currently underway in China, including the closing of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of almost all residents in the hope of blocking SARS-COV-2 transmission.
Although these measures have severely damaged the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, signaling a slowing epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the regression phase will last for 3 to 4 months.
However, some other experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others have estimated that COVID-19, which looks much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini et al. created a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-tooth swabs of patients who recovered and left hospital two weeks ago, suggesting the newly discovered virus could become a regular flu-like attack.
However, promising signs have emerged in China based on the declining number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies may have worked.
Ebola was originally expected to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, the disease was eventually brought under control by strict quarantine and isolation measures.
It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 becomes weaker in terms of causing infection and eventually disappears or becomes a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted at a higher rate through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with substances contaminated with the virus.
The virus has also been found in the stool, raising a new possibility of transmission from the stool to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by hospital infections, including 17 patients with other pre-existing diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, significant precautions are needed to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even passersby who have had contact with sick or injured people.
Wearing face masks is the first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; the use of both surgical masks and N95 Respiratory Masks (Series 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from an infected person from moving through the air or sticking to the surfaces of the material, where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (Series 1860s) can protect against inhalation of small virions as far as 10 to 80 nanometers, with only 5% of virions able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and is about 85 nanometers in size.
Since particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, health care providers directly in contact with patients should wear N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate insulation gowns to further reduce communication with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 doctor was infected despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent face protectors or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay at home to self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected individuals.
A distance of three feet is considered appropriate for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its close resemblance to SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 would have caused a high alert in China based on its deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, the director of the Centers for Disease Control in Wuhan did not reassure citizens until January 19, 2020, saying that the novel virus has a low infection rate and limited human-to-human reproduction and there is no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This letter severely underestimated the alertness of the general public, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and critical time was lost to contain the disease at its lowest range in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies may benefit from this harsh lesson and implement substantial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when issuing public statements because each word is important to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and interactive with unusual information than clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain and improve the role of a potential epidemic in the early stages of the community; and (4) more reassuring and testing of a public health system.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
It spread in less than two months across China and around 50 other countries globally at the time of writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has triggered a feeling of recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals more than young people and men more than women, and the rate of severity and mortality is also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually do this when they are severely ill, making it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Normal SARS-CoV-2 DNA testing can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovering patients can get the virus again.
These results significantly increase the risk of the virus spreading.
With this rapid advance in research on COVID-19, there are still many critical issues to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite the discovery of a 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like coronavirus in bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to the numbers 1 and 2, we can’t stop the transition efficiently, and the outbreak can come back at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the angiotensin 2 converter enzyme, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells secreted by the angiotensin 2 converted enzyme in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot make a quick and accurate diagnosis and provide effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it fade like SARS, or will it periodically come back like the flu?
It is necessary but it may take some time to look for answers to the above questions and many other questions.
However, at all costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
Animal origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have been driving the joint development of coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two types of human coronaviruses (human coronaviruses) were known to cause mild illness, such as a cold.
The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has shown the other face revealing how serious and life-threatening an infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-COV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 re-emphasized the coronavirus, and we were surprised at its rapid spread but with the ability to cause the disease compared to his brother SARS-COV.
The human coronavirus is an anthropogenic disease, so our understanding of the animal origins of human coronaviruses would serve us well.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats where they were non-pathogenic.
Hosts have also been known as intermediate depots for some human coronaviruses.
Identification of host animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Exploring the interrelationships between the coronavirus and the host in animals also offers important insight into the emergence of coronavirus disease in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of available information about the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the date of their discovery as well as their animal origins and interspecies transmission.
Most importantly, we compare and analyze the different human coronaviruses from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
In this context, the disease caused by the current 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is discussed.
In addition, it also highlights the requirements for successful host switching and the impact of virus development complications on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses (coronaviruses) belong to the family of coronaviruses, which includes a group of laminated viruses with single-chain positive ribose DNA.
These viruses contain the largest genome of viruses with RNA at 26 to 32 kB and are called “coronaviruses” by this name because their structure resembles the crown under an electron microscope.
In terms of synthetic properties, Coronaviruses contain undivided genomes that share similar regulation.
Nearly two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open reading templates (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are transformed into the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Multiple proteins are additionally treated to generate 16 nonstructural proteins, referred to as nsp1<0x7E>16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains open reading templates for structural proteins, including Spike (S), Shell (E), Membrane (M) and Nuclear Protein (N).
Different strains of coronaviruses also encode a number of additional proteins from special strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four types (Alpha, Corona Beta, Gamma Coronavirus, and Delta Coronavirus), including types of Coronavirus that include most human Coronaviruses and are divided into four strains (A, B, and V).
Evidence of genetic evolution has shown that bats and rodents act as genetic origin for most coronaviruses Alpha and beta-coronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses.
Over thousands of years, coronaviruses have consistently crossed species barriers, and some have emerged as the cause of serious human diseases.
Seven human coronaviruses (human coronaviruses) are known to date.
Among them are human coronavirus-229E and human coronavirus-NL63, which belong to the alpha coronaviruses.
The other five beta-coronaviruses include Human Coronavirus (OC43), Human Coronavirus (HKU1), SARS-CoV-associated Coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-associated Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
Human Coronavirus 229E, Human Coronavirus-OC43, Human Coronavirus-HKU1, and Human Coronavirus-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds, diarrhea or both.
By contrast, SARS-CoV, Mers-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 virus are all highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections of more patients with a higher likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and non-pulmonary symptoms.
Human Coronavirus 229E, the first strain of B814, was isolated from the nasal discharge of patients with colds in the mid-1960s.
Much of the information has since been gathered through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, whose symptoms resolve spontaneously.
In fact, it was generally accepted that infection with human coronaviruses was harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 is among the deadliest epidemics in our current history, with more than 8,000 people infected with an approximate death toll of about 10%.
Ten years later, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has spread a steady epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel coronavirus, renamed SARS COV-2, is the cause of the current pandemic, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people on March 3, 2020.
The alarm bells and the world must be prepared for the next SARS Cove-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have animal origins from bats, mice, or pets.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary origins of all human coronaviruses from bats, where viruses are well-adapted and not pathogenic but exhibit significant genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has raised enormous medical, scientific, social, and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Tracing the animal origins of human coronaviruses showed a framework for understanding natural history, driving power and factors limiting interspecies mobility.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for SARS COV-2’s warehouse, intermediate host, and amplified host animals, with important effects to prevent future fallout.
In this review we provide an overview of animal origins, interspecies transmission, and human coronaviruses causing disease.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common belief that the original human coronavirus viruses are usually non-pathogenic in their natural depot hosts but become pathogenic after transmission between species to a new host.
We also review the assessment of the path of the human coronavirus where the increase in its transmissibility is often accompanied by a decrease in the severity of the disease.
We are also discussing in this context the results of the current SARS KOV-2 outbreak.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain was first isolated from the nasal discharge of patients with colds, various types of coronaviruses were isolated from various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the past decades, seven types of human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of the human coronavirus in chronological order (Table 1) would be educational and informative.
The first strain of the human coronavirus-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory infections in 1966, after which it adapted to live in the ranks of the WI-38 lung cells.
Patients with HIV-229E experience common cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, malaise, and sore throat, with fever, and cough in approximately 10<0x7E>20% of cases.
Later in 1967, the human coronavirus-OC43 was isolated from the organ farm and the subsequent transmission was in the brains of infant mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are indistinguishable from other respiratory viruses such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Human Coronavirus 229E and Human Coronavirus OC43 have both spread globally and tend to spread during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a sense of illness for about two weeks.
According to a human voluntary study, the infection of healthy individuals with the human coronavirus-229E has caused a mild cold.
Only a few immunodeficiency patients showed severe lower respiratory infection.
SARS, also known as an atypical pneumonia, is the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history and its causative agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 confirmed cases and 774 deaths, spreading across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the super-infectious vector, it has been estimated that a single case can lead to approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and peak viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
SARS-Cove symptoms begin with muscle pain, headaches, fever, malaise, and chills, followed by late symptoms, difficulty breathing, coughing and respiratory distress.
Lymphosis, liver dysfunction, and high creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities for SARS.
In SARS patients, diffuse sepsis is also observed, phenocellular proliferation, and an increase in the number of phagocytic cells.
About 20-30% of patients then need intensive care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, in severe cases, many organs can also be infected, including the digestive tract, liver, and kidneys, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that may be fatal, especially in immunodeficiency patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open pulmonary biopsy of a relative of the first case who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to research on the human coronavirus.
Human Coronavirus NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be common in young children, the elderly, and immunodeficiency patients with respiratory diseases.
Colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchitis are common symptoms of the disease caused by the human coronavirus-NL63.
Another independent study described isolating the same virus from a sample from the nose of an 8-month-old child with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although discovered in the Netherlands, it is widely used worldwide.
Human Coronavirus-NL63 is estimated to be responsible for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with peak incidence during early summer, spring and winter.
Human Coronavirus-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as strangulation.
In the same year, HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, HKU1 has been reported to be associated with the exacerbation of acute asthma attacks.
HKU1 has been found to be globally prevalent and causes mild respiratory diseases, similar to HKV-NL63, HKV-229E and HKV-OC43.
All four of these human coronaviruses acquired from the community have adapted well to humans and in general, the likelihood of them mutating to cause diseases characterized by high prevalence rates is few, but the coincidence occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of the most vicious subtype of the human coronavirus-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe infection of the same organ.
Generally, when coronaviruses acquire this ability to efficiently transmit and sustain themselves consistently within humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Mers-Cove was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient with pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, cases brought from abroad and a rare secondary transmission of contacts have been reported in many European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak in South Korea in 2015 resulted in 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical symptoms caused by merce are similar to those caused by SARS, and are characterized by worsening acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many people with merce also suffered severe kidney failure, which is what distinguishes merce from other diseases caused by the human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making Myers-Cove one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
During the period from mid-December to late 2019, groups of pneumonia patients known to be the result of SARS-CoV-2 infection were discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the current outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection due to SARS CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international importance as it has called COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with an initial mortality rate of 3.4%.
The death rate in China’s Hubei province stands at 4.2%, while outside it stands at 1.2%.
SARS-COV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-COV and Mers-COV, and appears in the form of fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea also appears in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the large homogeneity in the sequence of nucleotides by 82%, they belong to different branches in the evolutionary tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less severe but more contagious than SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV.
It has been reported that people who don’t show symptoms despite being infected with SARS COV-2 may be contributing to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparison and contrast between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six human coronaviruses revealed significant similarities and differences.
First, human coronaviruses are similar in the incubation period and the time period of the disease.
In this regard, SARS COV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 infection is among the four community-acquired human coronaviruses (i.e., human coronavirus-229E, human coronavirus-OC43, human coronavirus-HKU1, and human coronavirus-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-COV-2 appears with traits that are more common in cases of community-acquired human coronavirus infection, including unspecific, minor, or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as with SARS-CoV, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows interesting patterns for both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS COV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses acquired from society.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after transmission to humans, as in SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV cases.
Finally, SARS COV-2 can be detected in stool samples as in other human coronaviruses.
Further studies are still needed in the future to clarify whether SARS-COV-2 transmission from the oral anal route plays an important role as in the case of SARS-COV at least in some cases.
It is worth noting whether SARS KOV-2 may show a seasonal spread, as in cases of human coronaviruses acquired from the community.
However, SARS-COV-2 traits, including transmissibility, and the mechanism of pathogenicity and sustainable spread after transmissibility of humans will have an impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four human coronaviruses acquired from society and causing minor symptoms have adapted well to humans.
Another perspective, which may also be true, is that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, they may both be survivors of the ancient Coronavirus epidemics.
Human coronaviruses, which infect humans with acute diseases, as well as humans who have been infected with acute human coronavirus diseases, have been eradicated.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be copied in humans enough to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that face the host’s constraining factors.
Based on this logic, the longer the SARS KOV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected with it, the greater the chance of it being fully adapted to humans.
If it adapts well, it is difficult to stop its transmission between humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
The four community-acquired coronaviruses spread across human populations over many years, causing colds in people with good immunity.
These viruses do not need an animal warehouse.
By contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV did not adapt well to humans, and were unable to continue to move between humans.
They need to stay in and breed in their animal warehouses and then look for the right opportunity to move on to the most vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate and amplified hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features to both SARS-CoV/Mers-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired from society.
It is as contagious as human coronaviruses acquired from society, at least for the time being.
However, it causes the disease more than community-acquired human coronaviruses and less than SARS-CoV or Mers-CoV.
It is not yet clear whether it will fully adapt to humans and spread among them without the need for a warehouse or an intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it would be useful to review the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, depot, intermediate and amplified hosts of human coronaviruses.
The animal plays the role of the evolutionary host of the human coronavirus if it harbors a closely related origin virus and share a significant similarity in the level of nucleotide sequences.
The original virus is usually well-adapted and not pathogenic to this host.
Similarly, the depot host has been harboring the human coronavirus continuously and over a long period of time.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its parent virus.
By contrast, if the human coronavirus enters the intermediate host recently before it attacks humans or is nearby, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes morbidity.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and also act as an amplified host by allowing the virus to temporarily clone and thus transmit it to humans to expand the range of infection among humans.
Human Coronavirus infection may reach a dead end if the virus fails to transmit from within the intermediate host.
Conversely, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host so that they may settle it for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural warehouse host.
Later epidemiological data revealed that the first case of SARS had a history of contact with the bullies.
Serological prevalence surveys then indicated that animal dealers had a higher rate of anti-SARS-COV IgG prevalence than ordinary people.
For the first time, it has been determined that Paguma larvata and the raccoon dog in live animal markets carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no other cases of SARS were reported after the killing of all yogurt cats on the market.
However, it has been reported that the result of screening SARS-CoV in a masked palm civet that lives in the wild or on farms without exposure to live animal markets was largely negative, suggesting that masked palm civet may only be an intermediate amplified host, but not the natural warehouse of SARS-CoV.
Since 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals also play the role of SARS-CoV amplified intermediate host is not excluded.
All of these seem to be hosts that don't transport SARS-CoV.
Subsequent research on the natural animal host of SARS-CoV has led to the detection of the closely related bat coronavirus, which is called the Chinese horse humpback virus, the yellowish humpback virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (HKU3) and which is found in the Chinese horse humpback virus HKU3.
The SARS-CoV antibody examination in these bats and the sequence of the Chinese yellow horse humpback virus genome associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome HKU3 was positive.
This virus and other bat coronaviruses share a 88–92% sequence of nucleotides with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several ARS-like coronaviruses (SARS-like coronaviruses) were identified from bats, but none could be isolated as a living virus except WIV1.
The human angiotensin 2 converter enzyme (angiotensin 2 converter enzyme) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 extracted from a feces sample of bats was shown to be using the angiotensin-2 converting enzyme in bats, cats, and humans as a cell entry receiver.
Interestingly, the serum of those recovering from severe acute respiratory syndrome had the ability to equate WIV1.
To date, the WIV1 virus is the most closely related origin of SARS-CoV in bats, as they share 95% nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high symmetry between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not a direct depot host of SARS-CoV.
The analysis of the development of the Mers-Cove strains in the HKU4 virus group in bats and the HKU5 virus in bats themselves.
The Corona-HKU4 virus is used in bats and Mers-Cove as the same host-receptor, peptide-peptidase4 (peptide-peptidase4), to enter the virus.
Mers-Cove's RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences are closer to the evolution of strains than beta-coronavirus counterparts in bats identified in Europe and Africa.
It has not yet been discovered that Myers-Cove lives in wild bats.
Mears-Cove and the Coronavirus-HKU25 in its closest bats share a 87% symmetry of nucleotide sequences.
Thus, the bats may not be the direct host of the Mers-Cove.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the only camels of the somnolence are positive serum-positive antibody equivalents of Mers-Cove, as well as camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
Mers-Cove has isolated the live matching virus found in humans from the nasal swabs of the solo camel beauty, indicating that camels act as the host of the original Mers-Cove depot.
It is also worth noting that minor symptoms generally appeared in camels that were experimentally infected with Myers-Cove, but that a heavy viral scattering was observed.
Infected camels spread viruses markedly not only through breathing but also through the oral anal route, which is the primary route for spreading the virus from bats.
However, questions remain because many of the confirmed cases of Mercer have no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, and these were logically attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unidentified species of animals housed in Mercer-Cove.
SARS CoV-2 Coronavirus RaTG13 is involved in insulated horseshoe bats in 96.2% nucleotide symmetry.
The sequence variability between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is so long that it is difficult to determine the relationship to the father, as in the cases of SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV.
This means that bats may not be SARS COV-2’s direct warehouse host(s) unless nearly identical bat coronaviruses are found in the future.
SARS-CoV-2 intermediate hosts are supposed to be among the wild animal species sold and killed at the Wuhan Seafood Market, to which several initial cases of COVID-19 have been linked, suggesting an animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a group of small endangered mammals known as the Manis javanica can also harbour beta-coronaviruses of origin associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These ant-eating novel coronavirus genomes and SARS COV-2 share 85-92% nucleotide sequences.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% similarity at the level of nucleotide sequences.
Two subspecies of SARS KOV-2-like viruses are grouped into a strain development tree, one of which shares a similar receptor binding domain (receptor binding domain) with SARS KOV-2, with a 97.4% amino acid sequence matching.
In stark contrast, SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains differ significantly from RaTG13, although the entire genome sequence is higher.
A previous study of a sick squamous ant eater also revealed the presence of viral organisms from lung samples, and it turned out to be similarly related to SARS COV-2.
This study adopted different aggregation and manual processing methods to generate a partial sequence of the entire length of the viral genome at approximately 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that squamous ant eater is an intermediate host of SARS COV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that squamous ant eater is the direct origin of SARS KOV-2 due to the divergence of sequencing between SARS KOV-2 and SARS KOV-2-associated beta coronaviruses in squamous ant eaters.
In addition, the spacing between SARS KOV-2 and RaTG13 is less than the spacing between SARS KOV-2 and beta-corona viruses associated with SARS KOV-2 in squamous antlers.
The evolutionary trajectory of SARS COV-2 in bats, squamous ant eaters, and other mammals is still under development.
While the highest sequential symmetry was found in the receptor binding domains between SARS-COV-2 and squamous antlers, the SARS-COV-2-associated beta viruses SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest symmetry of the complete genome sequence.
It is predominantly speculative that the high degree of similarity between SARS-COV-2 receptor binding domains in beta-coronavirus squamous ant eaters and SARS-COV-2 is driven by selective convergent evolution.
There is an anti-recombination probable proposition between SARS COV-2 in squamous ant eaters belonging to the beta-coronavirus and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
Recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses as a driving force for evolution.
The direct animal origin of SARS COV-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the animal origin of human coronavirus-229E, human coronavirus-OC43, human coronavirus-NL63, and human coronavirus-HKU1 have also been studied.
Evolving evidence of strains has suggested that both the human coronavirus-NL63 and the human coronavirus-229E may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while the father viruses of the human coronavirus-OC43 and the human coronavirus-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
The Coronavirus in bats, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Heights Coronavirus) detected in North American tricolour bats, has been reported to be closely linked to the human coronavirus-NL63.
On the other hand, human coronavirus-229E has been found to be genetically linked to another coronavirus in bats, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and camels have been suspected to be their intermediate host.
For illustration, current information on the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
An analysis of the evolution of strains has provided evidence of cases of human coronavirus transmission between species throughout history.
When the human coronavirus-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of transmission of HCoV-229E between species remains less clear.
Alpha coronaviruses in bats have been found to be closely related to human coronavirus-229E.
Between them is the Coronavirus Alpha in Alpaca.
Many evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans, not alpacas, may have a connection to bats in a common ecological habitat.
Humans have close contact with Alpaca.
Second, the human Coronavirus-229E, which belongs to the Coronavirus Alpha in bats, is multiple and non-pathogenic in bats, while the Alpaca Coronavirus causes respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-associated Coronavirus has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that alpaca was infected with human Coronavirus 229E, which belongs to human coronavirus alpha, cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause diseases to humans including rabies, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it’s not surprising that bats may transmit H Coronavirus-229E directly to humans.
While alpha-coronaviruses in bats play the role of synthesizing the genes of the human coronavirus-229E, alpaca and single-beauty somnolence may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as in Mers-Cove.
Mers-Cove gives an excellent example of interspecies transition: it moves from bats to camels that are the only humps, and from camels that are the only humps to humans.
The evolutionary origin of Mers-Cove has been known from bats since the beginning of their identification and has also been enhanced by subsequent results.
It is clear that bats provide a rich collection of viruses to exchange genetic parts within a species and their transmission between species.
Bats are long-lived, live in overcrowded colonies, close social interaction, and strong ability to fly, all of which are favorable conditions to make them an ideal “virus dispenser.”
Mers-Cove, on the other hand, has moved to the only camels that have humped for decades.
These beauties may have been well-adapted until you switched from an intermediate host to a normal, stable warehouse host.
Myers-Cove causes very mild illness and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
His intermittent transmission to humans remains a coincidence and man is a non-transmittal host for Mers-Cove where his transmission cannot continue.
Unlike camels in the Mers-Cove transport, the role of squamous antlers, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transport is different.
In particular, beta-coronaviruses associated with squamous ant-eaters cause severe disease.
They may be non-transmittal hosts for SARS-CoV-2 from beta-coronaviruses, similar to the yogurt cat in the SARS-CoV case.
Future studies will determine many possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between species of animals to humans by either proving them or ruling them out.
First, the bats may be the host of a virus linked to SARS-COV-2, which is mostly identical to SARS-COV-2.
Humans and bats may share an ecological habitat through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, squamous ant-eaters could be one of the mesothelioma hosts of the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2-associated virus.
Humans become infected with the virus by slaughtering and consuming parrot meat.
Many mammals, including pets, are likely susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
There is justification for the work of a survey of antibodies in pets and wildlife.
Third, as mentioned above, there may have been a recombination and adaptation of SARS COV-2 in a third type that has contact with bats and squamous ant eaters.
The search for the animal origin of SARS COV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, on the viral side there are three main and also important factors in facilitating the infection of coronaviruses to overcome species barriers.
First, the mutation rates are relatively high in RNA doubling.
Estimated coronavirus mutations rates, compared to other uni-series RNA viruses, can be considered "medium" or "high" with an average switching rate of <0x7E>10-4 switches per year for site 2, depending on the stage at which the coronavirus adapts to new hosts.
Coronaviruses involve an externally corrective ribonuclease enzyme, which its deletion leads to an extremely high mutability and attenuation or inability to develop.
Interestingly, remdisifer isotope nucleotides are known to inhibit the transcription of the coronavirus by inhibiting the external ribonuclease enzyme and RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Remdisifer is a precursor of SARS COV-2, which is to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rates of coronavirus mutations are about a million times higher than the rates of flight attendants.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when coronaviruses do not adapt appropriately to the host.
The mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower when compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
He seems to have already adapted to another host close to the human.
In addition to SARS Cove-2, this also applies to the Mers-Cove, which has adapted well to the only hump camels.
In theory, genetic aberration is unlikely to help vaccines and antiviral drugs resist SARS COV-2 by rapidly weakening its effectiveness.
Second, the massive RNA genome in coronaviruses actively provides extra plasticity in mutation modification and recombination of the genome, thereby increasing the likelihood of interspecies evolution, which benefits in the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions become favorable.
This is powered by uniquely abundant open-reading templates and protein-encrypted functions near the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> end of the genome.
Third, Coronaviruses randomly and repeatedly switch templates during RNA transcription through their unique “copy selection” mechanism.
In a host that is like a blending vessel, sequence switching occurs frequently during the transcription of the RNA of the coronavirus.
Highly symmetrical, full-length ribosome nucleic acids and secondary genomics may recombine to generate new coronaviruses.
Evidence of the evolution of strains of natural recombination has been found in HKU1 and OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses, as in bat-like acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and HKU9 in bats.
Virus interaction with the host associated with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receiver is another key factor influencing the transition between species.
In this regard, we consider SARS-CoV recombination as a typical example, which has also shown evidence of positive selection during interspecies transitions.
Based on a comparative analysis of isolated samples of SARS-CoV in humans and yogurt cats, it has been estimated that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in various hosts, particularly through mutations occurring in the domain of S-receptor binding.
In general, the domain of S-receptor binding to the coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensively selected by the antibody’s response to the host.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor binding field occurs in the amino acids 318 to 510 in S1, which is associated with the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme as well as the auxiliary receptors for virus entry.
The SARS-CoV receptor binding field is able to identify the angiotensin-2 receptors that help in various animals, including bats, citrus cats, mice and raccoons, allowing the virus to be transmitted between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed that differed from the human and citrus-insulated viral samples in the receptor binding field, of which 4 were found in the receptor sequencing pattern of interaction with the angiotensin-2-transforming enzyme receptor.
The mutations K479N and S487T are found in the SARS-CoV receptor binding field in the yogurt cat, which can increase the likelihood of a Spike protein reaction in the human angiotensin-2 receptor.
In other words, these two types of amino acid alternatives may be extremely important for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receiver as SARS-CoV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in the S1 protein unit, implying that the probability of S-protein binding in the human angiotensin-2 converter enzyme has changed.
Indeed, a study in ultra-cold electron microscopy indicated a 10- to 20-fold higher probability of this association compared to that between the human angiotensin-2 converting enzyme and the SVS-CoV protein.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other type of auxiliary receiver may be necessary for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
It is also interesting that the human coronavirus-NL63 is also associated with the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme but in a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as the HCoV-229E protein analyzer and the 9-O-cyalic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after transitioning between species of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of human coronaviruses is also governed by other factors of dependency and restrictions in the host.
The diffusion of these host proteins among humans and hostesses of natural repositories of coronaviruses, such as bats, single-snake beauties, and rodents may be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Human Coronaviruses need to control host dependency factors and weaken its constraint factors to carry out successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important space of virus interaction with the host remain detectable and characterizeable.
Wide, unbiased genome scanning can be used to research SARS-CoV-2 host dependency and limitations using advanced CRISPR technology.
Emerging Human Coronavirus Emergence: Back to the Starting Point
The diversity of coronaviruses in bats offers ample opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
Based on this logic, the coronaviruses in bats are a genetic complex of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the development of the human coronavirus, which are important points in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of emerging protein cryptography genes involves the ability to significantly modify viral phenotypes.
Among the regulatory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was thought to be important in adapting to humans, with virus-linked SARS-CoV isolated in bats but found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
The 29 properties of SARS-CoV nucleotide elimination were found to exist in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination through strains of alpha and gamma coronaviruses, with a large number of small recombinant areas identified in RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
In a similar way, research has shown that the Mers-Cove epidemic has seen recombinations between different strains, which have occurred in Saudi Arabia’s only hump camel.
In addition to SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV, recombinations have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses have been combined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-constructive genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection can also help unintended changes in the viral genome, most of which are likely to result from viruses getting rid of selective pressures, such as what happens by the host’s immune system.
The loss of the full-length ORF4 protein in the human coronavirus-229E phenotype strain due to the deletion of two nucleotides is an example of these effects.
Although it is possible to observe proper ORF4 in camel and bat viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the albeca-infected alpha virus shows single nucleotide incisions, which lead to the overlapping framework mutation.
Last but not least, the development of new coronaviruses is also driven by selective pressure in their warehouse hosts.
Unsymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases have been detected only when bats are infected with coronaviruses, indicating the mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It showed that bats appropriately adapted to corona viruses anatomically and physiologically.
For example, the weak activation of the inflammatory response in bats effectively reduced the pathogens triggered by coronaviruses.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats was suppressed due to the increased rate of NKG2/CD94 inhibitory natural killer cell receptors and the low level of expression of the major histological compatibility group I molecules.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen compounds (types of reactive oxygen compounds) caused by the high metabolic activity of bats can lead to both suppression of the transcription of the coronavirus and effect of correction by the external ribonuclease enzyme, thus providing selective pressure for the emergence of new host strains that are pathogenic.
Additional pathogenic strains of the coronavirus may arise by recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the host.
Consequently, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged over the past two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in warehouse hosts such as bats and camels.
They clone vigorously without provoking a strong immune response from the host.
Here are the secrets that explain why HIV carriers who don’t show symptoms and the causes of acute conditions see human infections.
Acute symptoms are mainly caused by overactive immune response and cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
Conversely, in the case of unaccompanied carriers of the disease, the immune response is separated from the copying of the coronavirus.
A similar strategy for detachment of the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-COV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, taking interferon type I at least in the first stage of SARS-COV-2 infection in humans can be used.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory particle NLRP3 in bats is poor.
With this mental logic, NLRP3 inflammatory particle inhibition using the MCC950 inhibitor is helpful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea of SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV.
While it was discovered that the beta-coronavirus in bats involved SARS-CoV in 95 percent nucleotide homogenization, there was also a coronavirus in bats that shared 96 percent of the nucleotide homogenization with SARS-CoV-2.
While it was discovered that yogurt cats and other animals in the markets harbor SARS-CoV-like viruses, they did not detect the direct intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
Corona beta viruses have been detected in squamous ant eaters that are highly homogenized with SARS COV-2, suggesting that squamous ant eaters may be an intermediate host or that squamous ant eaters' squamous beta viruses may have contributed to genetic chunks, leading to SAR2 reaching the final version of the squamous ant eater.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS KOV-2 was man-made, not intentionally or by accident.
Coronaviruses have returned to focus due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our idea of the importance of animal origins and repositories of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
The overwhelming evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, Mers-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 all trace their origins back to the bat and moved to the human via intermediate flight attendants.
Based on the SARS-CoV infection arising from human-joker contact in the markets, the closure of fresh produce markets and the killing of yogurt cats were supposed to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
By the same token, squamous ant-eating animals should be eliminated from the markets of fresh produce to prevent the transmission of the disease of animal origin, in light of the discovery of multiple genera of beta-coronaviruses in squamous ant-eaters that are very close to SARS COV-2.
However, whether SARS COV-2 has been transmitted to humans or not, as well as whatever its mode of transmission, through squamous antlers and other mammals, its transmission remains a topic that needs to be clarified in future research.
Mers-Cove, on the other hand, was found in the only camels of the hump for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for locals.
It is widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all the beauty of controlling Mears, as officials in China’s wildlife markets have done to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of Merck, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective Merck-Cove beauty vaccines, as well as other anti-infection measures.
If we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genetic patterns may arise and cause outbreaks.
A variety of coronaviruses associated with animal-origin diseases are found in wildlife.
In particular, the Coronaviruses in bats are very diverse that have the potential to cause diseases of animal origin.
There are many opportunities for the emergence and recombination of coronaviruses associated with zoonotic diseases, leading to new, more transmissible and/or deadly coronaviruses in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the ordeals of SARS, Mers and COVID-19, an appropriate preparedness and response plan should be prepared.
The fact is that many viruses have taken their place on the planet for a very long time.
They live in their own natural repositories until they have a chance to spread and multiply.
Although bats have many properties that propel the spread of viruses, the chance of human contact with bats and other wild animal species can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that requires them to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is a necessary procedure to gain a better understanding of the environment of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which proves useful in preventing their transmission from animals to humans and preventing future outbreaks.
Finally, the best way to prevent animal-caused viral diseases is to move humans away from the environmental positions of the natural reservoirs of animal-caused viruses.
The mystery of SARS-CoV-2’s animal origin remains surrounded by many questions that need to be answered.
First, if bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 to squamous antlers, it is important to know the conditions under which bats and squamous antlers share a similar environmental place.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, then the way humans communicate with them should be determined.
Third, if a third species of mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, then it should be explained how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and squamous ant eaters.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be suspected of carrying SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be performed.
Whether the host is a bat, squamous ant eater or other mammals, SARS COV-2 or its parent viruses are expected to be identified and are almost identical to their natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will reveal the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with its important actions to prevent and combat COVID-19 in humans.
Need to update “suspect case” and “confirmed case” criteria when diagnosed with COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus, which provided our experience and included relevant reference information for global pandemic control.
Although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice trials; thus, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidance and provided the newest diagnostic criteria, “suspected condition” and “confirmed condition,” according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (7th Edition) issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus), which is now officially known as COVID-19, became known as SARS-CoV-2.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team drafted a quick guideline and published it online in the journal Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has received great attention since its publication.
Please note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice trials; hence, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China's COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (http://www.nhc.gov.cn), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, issued a total of seven versions with some contexts fundamentally changing.
Our guidance has now been commented by Cho and others, who have made a simple grading proposal based on the clinical trial.
Their efforts have added a new guide to our guidance as well as become a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We support their great effort and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (experimental version 7) and recent studies.
According to the 7th edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspected case needs to combine any of the elements of an epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to achieve a comprehensive analysis, or needs to verify three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel to the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities with reported cases of COVID-19, or residence, within the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of communication with cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (with positive results of DNA testing); or (3) a history of communication with patients with reported fever or symptoms of the onset of the disease;
Clinical manifestations: (i) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (ii) with imaging-proven characteristics of COVID-19 infection; and (iii) showing the total number of white blood cells a normal, low, or low level of lymphocyte count in the early stage of infection initiation.
The prognosis of the confirmed case should be based on the prognosis of the prognosis of the prophylaxis of the prophylaxis of the prophylaxis of the prophylaxis of the prophylaxis of the prophylaxis of the prophylaxis of the prophylaxis of the prophylaxis of the prophylaxis of the prophylaxis of the prophylaxis of the prophylaxis of the prophylaxis of the prophylaxis.
The real-time polymerase chain reaction test for DNA in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second version (18 January 2020) and third version (22 January 2020).
The discovery of pathogens in the blood sample was added to version 4 (January 27, 2020) and 5 (February 8, 2020); then the Guide to Serum Reactions was added to version 7.
These modifications have relied on the researchers’ ongoing work to arrive at the design of an ideal DNA detection toolkit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of respiratory tract including blood samples, which have increased the availability of different samples, and support the transfer of the positive result of the specific antibody to the standards of confirmed cases.
In addition, there is growing evidence to be cautious when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and unaccompanied cases.
Therefore, the content of the information flow chart for Zhou et al. should be updated, as they rated the person with no clinical symptoms as “low risk”.
The score monitoring system also needs to be validated in practice and additional clinical studies.
In conclusion, we hope to have access to more direct guides as we invite our readers to provide us with their feedback.
To diagnose “suspected” and “confirmed” status, we call for the latest guidance from home countries to be followed and adhered to.
Our team will also update our guidance in time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh registers five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily rate
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh reported that, as of yesterday, 114 active cases and 33 home-based recoveries had been recorded.
Seventeen deaths have been recorded.
The director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, Dr. Mirjadi Sabrina Flora, told an online news conference that the deaths included four male and one female.
According to Dr. Mirgadi, there were two cases over the age of 60, two between the ages of 51 and 60, and one between the ages of 41 and 50.
She also said that two of the deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced a COVID-19 pandemic on March 11.
An official at a hospital told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saif Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Authority, who was receiving care at Kuwait Maitri Hospital.
Bangladesh’s Minister of Land Transport and Bridges, Obaid al-Qadir, said in an online video statement on Saturday that public transport would be halted longer than initially planned, until next Saturday.
Disruption of public transport initially began on 26 March and was due to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transport of basic commodities, namely, medical products, fuel and food, is still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 were recorded in Bangladesh on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
The three had already recovered by March 19.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 infections has exceeded 1 million worldwide.
Data from Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of cases of Coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-2) has exceeded one million cases worldwide.
COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus has caused at least 52,000 deaths.
This dangerous development came on the same day that Malawi confirmed the first cases of the coronavirus, and the first associated deaths were recorded in Zambia.
As of Thursday, North Korea claimed to be one of the few countries still free of coronavirus infections.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 105,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 in the 24 hours leading up to 10 a.m. Central European time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the United States, with at least 5,900 deaths associated.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday due to a coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, announced on Thursday that the city would be closed until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that salaries would continue to be paid to Russians without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency by 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions, and 1 against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the cities of Mecca and Medina all day, previously from 3pm to 6am only.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike D. Wayne announced that the state had extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Australia’s stores reduce toilet paper purchase limits per transaction
Australia's Wal-worth and Coles chain stores on Saturday and Sunday evening tightened the restrictions on buying toilet paper to cut it to two rolls of Wal-worth stores and one roll of Coles stores per transaction at all branches nationwide.
Aldi's stores also set up a single roll on Monday.
These purchase restrictions were posted as messages at payment points in store chains and on their Facebook pages.
It has been reported that buyers have stored it due to concerns about COVID-19 in case people need self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Wal-Marts approved restrictions on the delivery of toilet paper to homes, making it one roll per order.
The changes came after earlier restrictions by Wallworth stores on March 4 and Cools stores on March 5 allowed to buy only four rolls per transaction.
Colls reported in its March 8 news release that despite the four-pack restrictions, "many stores still sell all their belongings within an hour of receiving it," and described the order as "unprecedented", as well as Aldi's in a Facebook post on Tuesday, "unpredictable".
Sales increased “significantly” last week, according to a spokesperson for Wallworth stores.
The Costco store in Canberra also determined last week that the quantity allowed to buy is two rolls.
To ease the shortfall, Coles stores have ordered suppliers for larger wraps and increased the pace of delivery, Walworth stores have also ordered additional inventory, while Aldi stores have made their stock available for special offers scheduled for Wednesday early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but the local council’s restrictions on when to deliver trucks are making it harder.
Production costs are expected to rise as suppliers try to meet demand, with few special offers.
On Tuesday, Aldi announced that as a result of early stock availability, some stores will not be able to provide a special Wednesday offer.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, reported in a report to News.com.au that stores fill stores every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a large commodity, which leads to a decrease in the amount of inventory in terms of numbers, and when sold in full, leaves large empty spaces on the shelves, which reinforces the feeling of shortage.
Russell Zimmerman stated, according to ABC News, that "Cools stores and Walworth stores have the view that if there are a lot of goods on the shelves, and if products like toilet wraps and sterilizers can [buy] and be provided in bulk, that may reduce panic."
Who Gives a Crap, which produces recycled toilet paper, said on Wednesday it was running out of stock.
According to the News.com.au report, Kimberly-Clark, which produces toilet wipes at Clinex, and Solaris Pepper, which produces Sorbent wipes, confirmed that they are working 24/7 to continue to provide their products.
Domain.com, a real estate website, noted that some real estate sellers offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers stopped working on the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday’s edition of NT News, a daily print in the city of Darwin, contained eight-page advertisements that could be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores initially hesitated about imposing restrictions, according to a report released by ABC Australia on March 3, where stores said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also high demand for other products, including masks, sterilizers, dried goods, handwashing and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that a British online store named Okado limited purchases of Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s toilet paper to two 12-packs.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2), has reached pandemic level.
Although the word “pandemic” only refers to the extent of the disease, not the severity of specific cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that governments need to take action:
“All countries can still change the course of this epidemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), said: “If countries detect, screen, treat and isolate people, track their cases and mobilize them to cope.”
“We are all very concerned about the alarming levels of prevalence and risk as well as alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said in comments published by CNN in February, “No other respiratory virus has been tracked from the onset to the ongoing global spread, other than the flu.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying: “We have never been exposed to a pandemic caused by one of the coronaviruses.”
“We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new situation is described as a pandemic following the WHO’s decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: “The bottom line is that things are going to get worse.”
The Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of Thursday, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
An outbreak in Wuhan, China, was identified in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate in China was estimated at 4%, while globally it ranged from 13.04% in Algeria to 08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The period between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiretroviral treatment.
The primary treatment is supportive and symptomatic. The recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining spacing, monitoring, and self-isolation of people suspected of being injured.
Authorities around the world are responding to this threat by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closing facilities.
This pandemic has led to severe global social and economic turmoil, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and a widespread shortage of supplies exacerbated by a panic over purchases.
Schools and universities were closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world’s student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of origin and appearance in East and Southeast Asia, and other areas where significant cases of the virus have emerged.
As a result of reduced travel and closure rates for heavy industry, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan (the capital of Hubei Province) China reported a range of cases of pneumonia for an unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and investigation began in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly related to the Wuhan seafood market for wholesale, so the virus is believed to have an animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to coronaviruses in bats, coronaviruses in squamous antlers, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first person to show symptoms was clearly infected on 1 December 2019.
Of the early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report published by the South China Morning Journal indicated that a case dated November 17, 2019, aged 55 from Hubei province, may have been the first case. On February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although new cases in China were reported, the first one suddenly rose in Italy, Iran and South Korea, where the number of new cases exceeded the number of cases outside China.
There may be significant underreporting of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, a relatively small number of cases had been reported among young people, with 19-year-olds and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Valance, estimated that 60% of Britons needed to be infected before effective herd immunity was administered.
The cases indicate the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have been confirmed in accordance with official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested for more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official non-testing policies for people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that an estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 cases were not detected in China as of January 23, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection for 79 percent of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of cases in Italy was much higher than the number of recorded cases.
Initial estimates of the primary reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the period from worsening symptoms to death takes between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, COVID-19 caused about 97,000 deaths.
About 80% of deaths in China as of February 5 were concentrated in people over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 according to official protocols.
The real death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who die without testing – for example; at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data in Italy revealed that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official number of Covid deaths recorded by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States acknowledged that "we know that [declared death toll] reflects a lower estimate than reality", a statement supported by narrative reports of inaccuracy in the United States. Such underestimations occur in pandemics; such as the January 2020 H1N1 swine flu pandemic and its first death in 2009.
The first death outside mainland China was on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Many measures are commonly used to determine mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are affected by the size of the tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time taken since the outbreak began, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and public health. The mortality-to-injury ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given period of time.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality-to-injury ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of mortality from infections have decreased from 17.3% (for those who showed symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those who showed symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures indicate the case fatality rate (CFR) which reflects the percentage of those who died of the disease, and the mortality rate of those who died of the disease.
These statistics do not have a time frame and follow a specific population from the injury to the fate of the condition.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for certain populations.
The University of Oxford’s Center for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall infection mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate for this range corresponds to the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany, and to a statistical study that analyses the effect of the test on case mortality estimates.
The World Health Organization emphasizes the possibility of pandemic control.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
Massig Pony of Pennsylvania State University stated: “Infectious disease outbreaks that are left uncontrolled usually reach a peak and begin to decline afterwards when the disease does not find available hosts.
“But it’s almost impossible to come up with any reasonable expectation now about the timing of that.”
China's top medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said it "could be over by June" if all countries could be motivated to follow WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kocharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS Cove-2 "will be widespread for perhaps a year or two."
According to a study by Imperial College London led by Neil Ferguson, we will need to rely on physical spacing and other measures “so that a vaccine is available (probably after 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus will completely disappear — because it’s easily transmissible — and it could “turn into a seasonal disease — so it comes back every year.”
The ferocity of return will depend on collective immunity and how transformative it is.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively unspecified and may not show symptoms in those infected.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, excretion of respiratory sputum (sputum), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea, or glaucoma. WHO confirms that almost one person has difficulty breathing in each of six people.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States has restricted emergency symptoms to difficulty breathing, pain or constant pressure in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, face or lips glaucoma. Immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms occur. The worsening of the disease may lead to acute pneumonia, constipation, and syndrome.
Some patients may not show symptoms, but the results of the tests confirm their injury, so specialists have advised that people in contact with confirmed cases should be closely monitored and screened to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of asymptomatic cases range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the period between injury and symptoms) is between 1 and 14 days; often it is 5 days. As an example of confusion, the estimate of the Covid-19 population who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and later decreased to 15%.
Some details on how the disease spread are still under investigation.
It is believed that the disease is mainly spread during mixing or through spray scattering when coughing, sneezing or speaking; when mixing at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that a cough without covering the mouth may result in a spray scattered from 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some argue that the virus may also be transmitted by a spray stuck in the air for a long time, which may be produced while speaking. It may also produce a breathable spray during the exhalation process, including when speaking, although the virus is not generally airborne.
The spray may fall on the mouth or nose of nearby people or be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and CPR, may cause respiratory secretions to be released in the form of a spray and then cause diffusion through the air.
It may also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of spreading from stools to the mouth, this risk is thought to be limited.
The government of China has denied the possibility of SARS KOV-2 being transmitted from the stool to the mouth. The virus is more contagious during the first three days of onset of symptoms, although it may spread before any symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease.
People have been diagnosed with the disease up to three days before symptoms appear, indicating the possibility of transmission before severe symptoms appear.
There are few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) confirms that despite some uncertainty about how easily the disease spreads, one person can infect two to three others in general. The virus remains on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day on cardboard, and for up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been confirmed to have been infected with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, as is the case when touching other surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus, with the first of three people with pneumonia isolated from a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
SARS KOV-2 shares all of its properties with coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, home soap kills the virus, where it dissolves its protective membrane. SARS KOV-2 is closely related to the original SARS KOV virus.
It is believed to have an animal origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus genetically meets the genus of the beta-coronavirus, and falls under the subgenus of the Coronavirus Sarpe (B strain) as well as two strains originating from bats.
96% across the entire genome is identical to other samples of coronaviruses in bats (Bat Cove Rat G13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of genome sequences between squamous ant-eater viruses and human-generated viruses.
Comparison of the entire genome so far has resulted in the discovery of a maximum of 92% genetic material sharing between the Squamous Ant Coronavirus and SARS CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the Squamous Ant Eater is the median host of the virus.
HIV infection can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately made by the polymerase chain reaction of reverse transcription (RTBCR) of infected discharge or computerized tomography.
A study in Wuhan comparing polymerase chain reaction with computerized tomography suggested that computerized tomography is more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, though less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with pneumonia and other pathological stages.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not using computerized tomography to detect COVID-19 or consider it as a preliminary screening to diagnose the disease."
The World Health Organization (WHO) published several RNA testing protocols for SARS KOV-2 for the first time on January 17.
The test uses a chain reaction of reverse transcription polymerase (RTBCR) in real time.
The test can be done on samples of the respiratory tract or blood.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is generally performed by a nasal smear, and a smear from the throat can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies develop prayer tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them have been sufficiently proven to be widely used.
A cerebellum test developed by Celex was approved for emergency use in the United States only in approved laboratories.
The imaging properties of radiography and computerized tomography (CT) of people with disease symptoms include asymmetric terminal opacity such as laminated glass fog and distorted crystalline infiltration.
The Italian Radiation Society compiles an international online database of imaging results for confirmed cases.
Radiography without a polymerase chain reaction is a procedure of limited precision for detecting COVID-19 because it interferes with other diseases such as adenovirus infection.
A large study in China compared the results of the CT scan to the polymerase chain reaction and proved that although the imaging is less accurate in terms of proof of injury, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it be considered a screening tool in the infected areas.
Artificial intelligence-based circumferential neural networks have been developed to detect virus imaging properties in both radiation imaging and computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining generally good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding contact with the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and using a napkin when coughing or sneezing and then discarding it directly in the trash.
Those who are already infected are advised to wear a medical mask in public.
Physical spacing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Several governments have banned and advised against unnecessary travel to and from countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of spreading throughout society in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some individuals don’t know where or how they got it. Health care providers, who take care of a potentially infected person, are advised to use considered measures, mixing precautions and eye protection. Tracking contacts of infected people is an effective way. Health authorities help identify the source of the infection.
The use of mobile location data by governments for the purpose of tracking has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement demanding that such surveillance be restricted.
As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialized groups have worked on privacy-sensitive solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record how close a user is to other mobile phones.
Users will then receive a message if they approach someone who has been proven to have COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are promoted; for example, nasal and gargling with mouthwash is not a viable solution.
There is still no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working on a vaccine.
It is recommended to wash hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when soiling appears on the hands, before eating, and after emptying the nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because soap kills the virus outside the body, destroying its protective membrane.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also recommended the use of a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected using several disinfectants (within one minute of disinfecting the surface of stainless steel), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100% and sodium 0.1% hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and iodopovidone 0.2–7.5%.
Other disinfectants, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that when a person is suspected or confirmed to have been infected with COVID-19 in an office or care facility, all places such as offices, bathrooms, shared spaces and shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by the patient must be sterilized.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing, either bend the elbow and put it in front of the mouth and nose or use a tissue paper and get rid of any tissues immediately.
It is recommended that those who are likely to be injured use medical masks, as wearing the mask reduces the size of the breath spray and the distance it travels when scattered due to talking, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Wearing a desire mask can reduce [people’s] desire to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if the hands are not properly cleaned.” It is recommended for those who take care of people who are most likely to get sick.
The World Health Organization has recommended that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk of infection, such as those caring for someone with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun encouraging ordinary people to wear face masks.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States recommends wearing a non-medical face mask made of cloth. China specifically recommended that healthy people use disposable medical masks, especially in the case of direct contact with people (1 m (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging individuals to make and wash cloth masks at home every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned going out to public places without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government ordered anyone entering a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel asked all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, demanded that passengers on intercity trains and buses wear masks on April 1.
Panama has made wearing a face mask at the exit necessary, with also recommending the manufacture of face masks at home for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing inter-individual mixing.
Roads include quarantine; travel restrictions; closure of schools, workplaces, playgrounds, theaters, or shopping malls.
Individuals can apply ways of social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, exchanging greetings without contact, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments currently impose or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if no COVID-19 spread was detected in the region) to 50, and 10 people later.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. The elderly and those suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and weak immune systems are facing the risk of contracting serious diseases and complications and have been advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stay at home as much as possible.
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to the suggestion that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to communicate with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health directives for use during the pandemic.
This includes recommendations to only have sex with someone you live with who is not HIV-positive or has symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Several governments have imposed or recommended self-quarantine for all populations living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine instructions were issued to those of the most vulnerable groups.
Those who have treated a person with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region where the infection is widely transmitted have been self-quarantined for 14 days from the time of another potential exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or curbing and limiting the spread.
Containment is applied in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected as well as introduce other measures to combat infection and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease becomes impossible to contain, efforts are then directed to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be carried out at the same time.
Restraint requires more stringent measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of primary breeding to less than 1. Part of the management of infectious disease outbreaks tries to reduce the peak of the epidemic, while the epidemic curve is known as flattening.
This reduces the risk of health services stress and saves more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may address the outbreak include personal protective measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-quarantine; community actions aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling major gatherings; community solidarity to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning surfaces.
Other countries have also taken a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass checks and local quarantines, and issued alerts about the movements of the injured.
Singapore provided financial support to the injured who isolated themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and criminalized the stockpiling of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigating ( slowing the spread of the epidemic rather than stopping it) and curbing (reversing the growth of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak demand for health care by 2/3 and deaths by half, but they still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and strains of health systems.
Braking may be preferred but should be maintained as long as the virus spreads to humans (or until the vaccine becomes available, if this happens first), as the transmission, on the other hand, bounces back quickly when measures are eased.
Long-term intervention to curb the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs are approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may aggravate the results.
Many of the compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being screened for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also stated that some “traditional and domestic treatments” can provide relief for symptoms caused by SARS COVID-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting health care centres to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as key measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to move resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on testing for COVID-19, eliminating optional procedures where possible, separating and insulating people with COVID-19, increasing intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of artificial respirators and beds available.
There are multiple theories about where the first condition originated (so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Bhubi, China.
Within a month, the number of cases of the coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly linked to the Wuhan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus came from one of these species of animals; in other words, it has an animal origin. A group with pneumonia for an unknown reason was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jiexian at Jiang Hospital.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a “sars-like coronavirus.”
Police alerted eight of these doctors, including Li Wen Liang, for spreading false rumours, and another doctor, Ai Vin, was reprimanded by their superiors to raise the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission subsequently issued a public notice on December 31 and notified the World Health Organization.
Sufficient cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan, prompting them to start the investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases nearly doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, with the help of commutations during Chinese New Year, and to Wuhan as a transportation hub and intersection of major railway lines.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequently announced official data shows that 6,174 people already had symptoms by January 20, 2020. As of March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide, with more than 97,000 people killed and more than 3,64,000 recovering.
About 200 countries and territories have registered at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted freedom of movement and imposed border controls.
National responses included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter orders, or closures) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were subjected to one form of closure in the United States, and more than 50 million people in South Africa were subjected to closures, and about 1 million in the Philippines.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide underwent one form of closure, a number that rose to 2.6 billion two days later—about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates from 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case was on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a series of cases of pneumonia caused by an unknown cause on December 26, and subsequently informed her hospital of the CDC in Jianghan Bohan on December 27.
A preliminary genetic test of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31.
WHO was informed on the same day.
In the presence of these notifications, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police about “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
China’s National Health Commission initially claimed there was no “clear evidence” of moving from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that Communist Party of China Secretary General <0x58>i Jinping later called a “people’s war” to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as the "largest quarantine in human history", a health collar was announced on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, extending to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people.
Private vehicles are banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled in several places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a makeshift hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital, Lishinshan Hospital, was then built to deal with the additional patients.
In addition to newly established hospitals, China has also converted another 14 facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into makeshift hospitals. On 26 January, the government took other measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including providing health announcements to travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools have also been closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have taken several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been taken in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement has been controlled in several cities, and it is estimated that some 760 million people (more than half of the population) have been subjected to one form of exit restriction. After the outbreak became global in March, Chinese authorities took tough measures to prevent the virus from being “infected” from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all those returning to the city from other countries. On March 23, one case was transmitted locally in mainland China over the past five days, via a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang stated that the prevalence of locally transmitted infections has receded and the outbreak in China is under control.
Travel restrictions in Hubei were eased on the same day, with the exception of Wuhan, two months after the closure was imposed. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March 26, 2020 that visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28 onwards, with no specific details on when this policy would end.
Those who wish to enter China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged companies and factories to resume work on March 30, and provided a cash incentive package for companies. The State Council announced a three-minute mourning day starting at 10:00 a.m. on April 4, in conjunction with the Qingming Festival, although the central government demanded that families show their respect online in order to avoid the COVID-19 outbreak.
COVID-19 transmission from China to South Korea was confirmed on January 20, 2020.
The National Health Agency announced a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely due to the gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shinchiungi Jesus Church.
It was suspected that <0x58>inqionji followers visiting Daegu from Wuhan were the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 people, or about 13% of the 9,336 followers of the church, reported symptoms. South Korea reported the highest levels of alert on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers were infected with the virus.
Flight schedules were also affected, and then changed. South Korea implemented what is considered the largest and best organized program in the world to screen people for the virus, isolate any infected person as well as track their contacts and quarantine them.
Screening methods included mandatory personalized reporting of symptoms by new international entrants via the mobile app, HIV testing of people inside their cars with test results available the next day, and increasing testing capabilities to 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program represents a success in controlling the outbreak although no quarantine has been applied to entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either demanding the removal of Moon, alleging the government’s mistreatment of the outbreak, or lauding his response.
On March 23, it was announced that South Korea had the lowest total cases in a single day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that as of April 1, all new arrivals from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests from 121 different countries to help test for the virus.
Iran reported its first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 on February 19 in Qom, where two people died later the same day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, institutes of higher education and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on February 26, 2020 that there is no plan to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals will be isolated.
Plans to limit intercity travel were announced in March, although heavy intercity traffic continued ahead of the Persian New Year in Nuruz.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became a hub for the spread of the virus after China.
In the midst of allegations of cover-up by Iran over the extent of the outbreak, more than a dozen countries tracked their cases returning from Iran as of February 28, suggesting that the extent of the outbreak may exceed the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government as of that date.
Iran’s parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members confirmed to be infected with the virus on March 3.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and also provisionally release eligible prisoners.
There is a high risk of the virus spreading indoors, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government announced 100 deaths in one day, the largest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 Iranian politicians and current and former government officials have died from the disease by March 17.
By 23 March, Iran was recording 50 new cases per hour, and one death every 10 minutes from the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, the number of cases in Iran may be up to five times what has been announced.
It is also believed that U.S. sanctions on Iran may affect the state’s financial capacity to respond to the outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has called for the easing of economic sanctions on countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak in Italy was confirmed on 31 January, when SARS-CoV-2 tests of Chinese tourists in Rome came in positive.
Cases began to increase sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unrelated group of COVID-19 cases was later discovered, beginning with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Cabinet announced a new law to contain the outbreak, including quarantines of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, “He will not be allowed to enter or leave the outbreak areas.
Work activities and sporting events in those areas have already been suspended.” On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country with 100 deaths in Italy.
All major sporting events, including Premier League matches, were scheduled to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activities, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, SIAARTI published medical ethics recommendations regarding screening protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy outperformed China as the country with the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after 3,405 pandemic deaths were reported.
On 22 March, Russia sent nine military aircraft carrying medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recovered in Italy, most of which were in the Lombardy region.
A combination of a large number of older people and the inability to test all people living with the virus so far in Italy may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as the most lax among affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the UK government had not imposed any form of social distancing or comprehensive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has received criticism for its notable lack of speed and intensity in responding to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising to avoid unnecessary travel or social contact, suggesting that people work from home as much as possible and avoid several places, such as bars, restaurants, and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that it would close all recreational facilities such as bars and gyms as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a maximum of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to reduce unemployment at the time of the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, as gatherings of more than two people were banned for outdoors and activity was restricted.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were implemented by the police by issuing fines and dispersing gatherings.
Orders have been issued to close most of the companies, with the exception of “necessary” commercial projects, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages.
On January 20, the first known case of COVID-19 in the northwestern Pacific state of Washington was confirmed by a man returning from Wuhan on January 15.
The White House Task Force on Coronavirus was set up on January 29.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and imposed entry restrictions on travellers from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) — the US government’s flagship public health institute — announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Despite doing so, the United States slowed down the start of the test, blocking the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The test corrupted a flawed test set produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval of non-state test sets (by academia, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for the test until early March (a doctor's order was then required).
By February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been performed.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: "Many people who had experienced symptoms and had a doctor's order waited hours or days for testing."

Companies imposed travel restrictions on employees, canceled conferences, and urged employees to work from home.
Activities and sports seasons were cancelled. On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions for most of Europe, with the exception of the United Kingdom, for 30 days, effective March 13.
The following day, the restrictions were extended to include the UK and Ireland.
On March 13, a national emergency was declared, allowing federal funds to be used to respond to the crisis.
As of March 15, many companies have closed or reduced their working hours across the United States in a bid to limit the spread of the virus.
By March 17, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia. On March 23, 10,700 coronavirus cases were reported in New York City, more than the total number of cases in South Korea.
On March 25, the governor said social distancing appears to have been a success, with estimates showing cases doubling from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City, and 672 people died from the virus. On March 26, more confirmed cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of April 8, 400,335 cases were confirmed in the United States, and 12,841 people died.
According to media reports on March 30, U.S. President Trump decided to extend the social divergence directives until April 30.

On April 3, the United States recorded 884 deaths from the coronavirus within 24 hours.
In New York State, the number of cases exceeded 100,000 on April 3. The White House was criticized for underestimating the threat and control of news circulation by directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements and publications related to the virus with the office of Vice President Mike Pence.
The Trump administration of the crisis was not universally acclaimed as it created widespread polarization among parties.
Some U.S. officials and commentators have criticized the U.S.’s reliance on importing essential materials, including essential medical supplies, from China.
An analysis of air travel patterns was used to map and predict spread patterns and was published in the Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Association 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei had the largest number of passengers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne have also been reported as popular destinations for travelers from Wuhan.
Bali was reported to be the least able of more than 20 popular destinations in terms of preparedness, while cities in Australia were considered to be the most capable. Australia released its Emergency Response Plan for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on 7 February.
Much has not yet been discovered about the COVID-19 virus, and Australia will stress border control and communications in its response to the pandemic.
On 21 March, a biosecurity emergency for humans was declared in Australia.
As public transport is affected by effective quarantine in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic staff from the region, primarily through charter flights from their home countries, with Chinese authorities providing permits.

On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate the Americans aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess.
On February 21, an aircraft landed in Trenton, Ontario, carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, a South African airliner chartered by the South African government returned 112 South African citizens.
A pre-departure medical examination was carried out, leaving four South Africans with signs of coronavirus to mitigate the risk.
South Africans whose test results were only negative were returned.
The test results proved that South Africans, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission who were all, as a precaution, under surveillance and quarantine at the Ranch resort for 14 days, were uninjured.
On March 20, the United States began withdrawing its forces partly from Iraq due to the pandemic.
On February 5, the Chinese Foreign Ministry reported that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad, Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) had sent aid to China.
Some Chinese students at U.S. universities banded together to send aid to HIV-infected areas of China, and a joint group in the Greater Chicago area reportedly managed to send 50,000 N95 masks to hospitals in Hubei province on January 30. The humanitarian organization Direct Relief, in coordination with FedEx, sent 200,000 face masks by June to the hospital, along with other emergency personnel, including the QAF.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a <0x24>100 million donation to the World Health Organization to fund vaccine research and treatment efforts, as well as to protect “at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia.”
Intraxion reported that the Chinese government donated 200,000 masks to the Philippines on February 6, after Senator Richard Gordon shipped 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.
On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it would send <0x24>2.26 million in aid to China.
Japan donated a million face masks to Wuhan, Turkey sent medical equipment, Russia sent more than 13 tons of medical supplies to Wuhan, Malaysia announced donated 18 million medical gloves to China, Germany delivered several medical supplies including 10,000 protective suits, and the United States donated <0x24>10.8 million in medical supplies to China.

Entrepreneur Jacques Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million face masks and 60,000 protective suits to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where they were distributed by the African Union.
He later sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 face masks and 5 artificial respirators to Panama.
Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concern about masks and test kits made in China.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 coronavirus test kits made in China that were only 30% accurate, and in the meantime, the Netherlands returned 600,000 face masks made in China that were defective.
Belgium returned 100,000 unusable face masks that were thought to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, parts of Latin America and Africa have welcomed the receipt of Chinese aid well. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of obscuring prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government provided "regular updates to avoid panic before the Lunar New Year holiday".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement the transportation ban in Wuhan, the representative of the World Health Organization (WHO) Gudden Galia noted that while this was "not certainly a recommendation made by the WHO", it was "a very important indicator of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is heavily concentrated", and described it as "an unprecedented number of cases in the history of public health in China".
The WHO Director-General said the outbreak was considered a public health emergency of international concern due to “the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without strong health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "the World Health Organization does not recommend limiting trade and mobility".
On 5 February, the World Health Organization (WHO) appealed to the international community to contribute <0x24>675 million to strategic funds in low-income countries, citing the urgent need to support those countries that “do not have systems to detect people living with HIV, even if it does appear.”
Tedros also made statements in which he declared that "our strength is measured by the strength of the weakest person in us" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay a big price later". On 11 February, the World Health Organization called the disease, at a press conference, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guterres had agreed to offer “the full potential of the United Nations system to respond.”
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team has been set up, allowing for the coordination of the entire United Nations response, and the World Health Organization will allow it to “focus on the health response while leveraging the expertise of other agencies to know the broader social, economic, and developmental impacts of the outbreak.”
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China was set up to provide international experts and experts from WHO on the ground in China to assist in local administration and assess the "severe and transmissibility of the disease" by hosting workshops and meetings with key national institutions, and to conduct field visits to assess the "impact of response activities at the level of the provinces and cities, including the world's urban and rural areas," he declared on 25 February.
In response to the outbreak in Iran, the World Health Organization sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said the global coronavirus threat assessment would rise from “high” to “very high,” its highest level of warning and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization’s Emergency Health Programme, warned in a statement that “this is a real test for every government on earth: so we have to be prepared.
The virus may be on its way and you should prepare for it," he said, urging the right response measures that can help the world avoid "worse things."
Ryan also stated that current data does not justify public health officials declaring the disease as a global pandemic, saying such a declaration means "we fundamentally accept that every human being on this planet will be exposed to this virus."
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said the WHO was “deeply concerned by the alarming levels of prevalence and severity, and alarming levels of inaction.” The WHO has faced severe criticism for what is seen as inadequate treatment of the pandemic, including the delay in declaring a public health emergency, and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
The violent reactions included a petition by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to resign, which was signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts confirmed respect for the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Group of Experts stated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and the government bears this responsibility.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not be a justification for discrimination against a particular group.
Experts stressed that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in very poor conditions, and detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
Intergovernmental organizations address the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The OECD has launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.

The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Office Secretary Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son Edward Bolsonaro for her handling of the pandemic, which began in China's Hubei province.
Several CBC directors have been dismissed at the cross-sectoral level for dealing with quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political establishment’s response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe the move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary General <0x58>i Jinping from public discontent with the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example Zhao Lijian, have rejected a previous admission that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories claimed by the United States or Italy regarding the COVID-19 virus.
The U.S. Donald Trump administration described the coronavirus as a “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus,” saying China had “imposed a blackout on the news that has exacerbated the virus, which has now become a global pandemic,” which some critics have criticized for being racist and “deflecting [attention] for its administration’s failure to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast obtained a U.S. government cable reviewing the National Security Council's clear-source communications scheme, stating with a strategy that "everything is about China.
We were asked to seek and disseminate these messages in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. “News sources such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg claimed that China’s efforts to send aid to HIV-affected countries are part of a propaganda push for global impact.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned of a “geographical and political component that includes a struggle for influence through the practice of circumvention and generosity policies.”
Borrell also said, “China is strongly pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called on the United States to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the last two countries.
U.S. sanctions banned Jack Ma from donating 100,000 masks to Cuba on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of transferring aid to other countries to their country.
There have been reported mask-related disputes among other countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of artificial respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of EU solidarity with Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Masari, Italy’s ambassador to the European Union, said: “China has only responded bilaterally.
“This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin equipped the Russian military to send military paramedics, special decontamination vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an unnamed “high-level political source” as saying that 80 percent of Russia’s aid was “useless or insignificant to Italy.”
The source accused Russia of embarking on a “geographical and diplomatic political” offensive.
Lombardi’s president, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the press reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “when providing assistance to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are activated again, they will also be able to retaliate if necessary.”
NATO's scheduled "Cannon 2020" military exercises will be held in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War on a small scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticised the 2020 cannon training, saying: “In light of the current public health crisis, the training puts not only the lives of troops from the United States and many participating European countries at risk, but also the populations of the countries where it will be carried out.” The Iranian government has been strongly affected by the virus, with about twenty members of parliament as well as fifteen other former or current political figures.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020, asking for help, saying that his country is struggling to fight the outbreak because of lack of access to international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has sparked calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, and higher paid family leave.
Political analysts have predicted that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticised Japan's "mysterious and negative quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be quarantined at certain government sites for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for the impeachment of Moon for claiming that the government has mishandled the outbreak or praised its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concerns that this could allow governments to tighten their control of power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those who spread false information about the virus and the government’s handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak, which has led to numerous supply shortages, has been blamed for the growing global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven procurement, and disruption of factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about a shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and a halt to suppliers.
Many areas also experienced panic-driven purchases, resulting in shelves being devoid of basic grocery items such as food, toilet paper, and water bottles, causing a shortage of supplies.
The tech industry in particular has warned of delays in shipments of electronic goods.
According to World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by 100 times.
This demand led to prices rising by up to twenty times the normal price and also caused medical supplies to be delayed by four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with the World Health Organization warning that this will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has opened up a new opportunity for Diago shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity led to a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the widespread spread of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent high demand for food products, the two regions survived severe food shortages.
Actions by China and Italy to combat the stockpiling and illicit trafficking of vital products have averted severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy’s large agricultural output has not declined significantly, but prices could rise according to industry representatives’ expectations.
Food shelves were temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food producers to keep stocks for such emergencies.
China felt the damage to the global economy: According to a media report on March 16, the Chinese economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to curb the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economic and industrial hub, the outbreak of the virus has been observed to pose a significant and destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agatha Demaris of the Economic Intelligence Unit expected the markets to remain volatile until a clearer picture of possible outcomes emerged.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those that occurred as a result of the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimated that the global supply chain was affected by more than <0x24>300 billion, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reportedly experienced a “disruption” after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on Feb. 24 due to the high number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indices, including the Nasdaq-100, the Standard <0x26> Poor’s 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded their biggest drop since 2008, with Dow dropping 1,191 points, its biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis in 2007–08.
The three indicators ended the week down by more than 10%.
On February 28, Scoop Ratings GMPH confirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained negative expectations.
Stocks fell again due to concerns about the coronavirus, and the biggest drop was on March 16.
Many believe that economic stagnation is possible.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures taken by central banks and countries in a timely manner.
Central banks respond faster than they did in the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, the closure of public places including tourist attractions, and the warning of governments against travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern and Cannes, while the British regional airline, FlyP, collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line industry has been at an unprecedented level.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the spring holiday travel season known as Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of mass events, including New Year’s celebrations, with private companies also closing their stores independently and attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and attractions have been closed to prevent large gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, and in municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled New Year celebrations. The global retail sector has been affected by reduced shop hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a decline of between 50 and 60 percent.
This also led to a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increasing hygiene, installing thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and canceling events. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC), the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the approximately 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers were trapped in their homes in the inland provinces, or in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The outbreak of the Coronavirus in 2020 may cost the middle of the country 47 million jobs in the United States, and the unemployment rate may reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The shutdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive salaries through daily wages) nearly 9 percent of the unemployed. The survey found that 4 percent of the workers lost their jobs.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany sent their workers in government-backed short-term action plans known as Kurzarbit.
France and Britain adopted the German short-term work compensation plan.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as individuals—working and independent—worldwide.
The arts and culture sector has sought to support its (often government-funded) mission to provide access to the cultural heritage of the community, maintain the safety of its employees and the public, and support artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions have been closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, there have been intensified efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other recent and accelerated fallouts of the disease include the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals, concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered a pause. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the celebrations of Holy Week in Rome, which take place during the last week of the season of Christian repentance in Lent.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, live streaming over the Internet or television while others offer worship without leaving their cars.
With the closure of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome and the chapel, and the evacuation of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also abolished services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and the Gordwara.
Iran’s Ministry of Health announced Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak were canceled and shrines were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as its residents from entering the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
This pandemic caused the biggest disruption to the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including UEFA Champions League 2019-20, UEFA Premier League 2019-20, UEFA Europa League 2020, NBA season 2019-20, and National Hockey League season 2019-20.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin at the end of July, and the IOC announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled beyond 2020 but no later than the summer of 2021". Gambling clubs and other venues around the world have been closed and live gambling tournaments postponed or cancelled.
This led many gamblers to switch to online gaming, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in new subscription rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, as different music groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many big theaters like the one on Broadway have suspended all shows as well.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing the work online as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming parties or creating online “celebrations” for artists to perform, distribute and publish their work.
Numerous Internet memes about the coronavirus have spread on the Internet as much has turned to humor and amusement under uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, extreme prejudice, xenophobia and racism have been observed towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports issued in February (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed by different groups around the world towards the Chinese that they deserved the virus or were receiving what is purportedly justifiable punishment.
Anti-China sentiment has also seen a rise in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their regional origin.
There has been support for the Chinese both online and offline, and for those living in areas affected by the virus.
After the outbreak spread to new hotspots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, may be exposed to skepticism and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions for pressure to prevent the Chinese from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag ChineseDontComeToJapan is <0x23>Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increasing levels of racist abuse, as well as assaults.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a “Chinese virus,” a term critics have called racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China and who study in major Indian cities, have been harassed by the coronavirus outbreak.
The head of the BJP unit in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and “that’s why God took revenge on them.”
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned the remarks, calling them “wrong.” In China, the pandemic has led to increased xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, with foreigners being labelled as “foreign garbage” and targeted “to get rid of them”.
Many newspapers have removed paid subscription pages for some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Several scientific publishers have made available scientific papers related to the outbreak for open access.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.
Emerging infectious diseases – communicable diseases from emerging pathogens, are often emerging in terms of the extent of their outbreak or the way they are transmitted.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 include ways to detect the presence of the virus where you identify antibodies that produce in response to the infection.
RT-BCR confirms the presence of viruses in the samples, where it detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is accurate and designed only to detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-2.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) is used to diagnose and monitor the population.
Antibody tests show the number of people who have contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to report or those who had no symptoms.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of mass immunity among the population can be determined based on the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country in March 2020 had reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population.
On 23 March, no country examined more than 3% of its population, and there is a significant difference in the number of tests conducted by different countries.
This discrepancy is also likely to have a significant impact on reported case mortality rates, which are likely to be overestimated in some countries.
Using the intraday polymerase chain reaction of reverse transcription (RTBCR) can be scanned on respiratory samples obtained in different ways, including nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-BCR, which is used with throat swabs, is only used in the first week of the disease.
The virus may then disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people undergoing screening in the second week, a sample of deep airways can instead be taken by a suction catheter or a coughing agent (sputum).
An early BBCR test in Charit<0xC3><0xA9> in Berlin was launched in January 2020 using the RTR-PCR intra-intraday polymerase chain reaction, and formed the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on January 23, 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech has also developed a PowerChek Coronavirus detection kit for SARS-CoV-2 that is suitable for safe clinical use and based on BCR on January 28, 2020.
Looking for the "E" gene that is shared by all SARS-COV-2 Coronaviruses and SARS-COV-2 RdRp. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Products Administration for SARS-COV-2 detection kit based on BCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test crews resulted in inconclusive results due to defective reagents, and one stage of the test was delayed by the other at CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in less than 100 samples per day on average being successfully tested throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components did not have confidence until February 28, 2020, and until then government and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The FDA approved the test under an emergency use permit. Commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, Lab Corp announced the availability of a nationwide COVID-19 test based on RT-PCR.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics allowed COVID-19 testing across the country as of March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; sampling and processing shall be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the State Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research, Victor, created and produced the COVID-19 test.
On February 11, 2020, the Federal Health Care Surveillance Service registered the test. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect a COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics obtained FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on large numbers, allowing one machine to perform a 24-hour range of testing.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use permission (E.U.A.) to Abbott Laboratories to conduct a test on the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted a similar permit to Hawlik, Lab Corp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Sifeed received a similar emergency use permit from the Food and Drug Administration in favor of a 45-minute test.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved a test that uses the technique of amplifying equatorial DNA instead of BCR.
Since this does not require a series of consecutive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase manufacturing for 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is also developing a test using a monoclonal antibody that is specifically linked to the nuclear cappuccino protein (Protein EN) of the novel coronavirus, hoping to achieve results within 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A review of studies in March 2020 concluded that "thoracic <0x58>-rays have minimal diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of CT [computerized tomography] may be clear even before the onset of symptoms."
Typical characteristics seen in computerized tomography include double-sided, multilobular sterile glass obscurities with asymmetric and background perimeter distribution.
The spread develops under the pleura and irregular patches appear and intensify as the disease develops.
A study in the city of Wuhan comparing PCR with computerized tomography for the origin of the current pandemic suggested that computerized tomography is more sensitive than PCR, though less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with cases of pneumonia and other pathological stages.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiography recommends "not using computerized tomography to detect COVID-19 or consider it as a preliminary screening to diagnose the disease". In March 2020, CDC recommends using BCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infection of individuals within a period of 7 days or after symptoms appear, to determine immune capacity, and in the case of population surveillance. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by clinical point-of-care testing (PCT).
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the rate of production per system.
For central laboratories, a single sample of peripheral blood cells is usually used, although successive samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For a clinical care point test, a single blood sample is usually drawn by puncturing the skin.
Contrary to BCR methods, the extraction step does not need to be performed prior to screening. On March 26, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration identified 29 entities that had notified the agency according to the requirements and could therefore distribute their antibody tests.
On 7 April 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved only one test under emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European accreditations for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The test completes several hundred samples in a matter of hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional BBCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can often be detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. In early April, the UK discovered that the antibody test kits it purchased were not good enough to use.
Hong Kong has developed a plan under which patients suspected of infection can be treated at home, "the emergency department gives patients a sample tube," spit into the tube, and return it again to get the test result after a short period of time. The NHS has announced that it is testing a vehicle for suspected cases of infection at home.
In-vehicle testing centers have enabled South Korea to carry out a range of the fastest and most comprehensive tests globally. In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Doctors stated on March 2 that it had been able to take around 12,000 tests per day for outpatients and 10,700 people had been tested last week.
Health insurance will bear the costs if a doctor orders the test.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of about 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, in-vehicle HIV testing was available in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was not known, as only the positive case results were announced.
A preliminary laboratory study revealed that starting in the 12/2020 calender week, at least 483,295 samples were tested until the end of the 12/2020 week, and the results of 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing the same samples taken.
With Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, overseeing the construction work and taking 5 days to complete, modelling operations showed that cases in Hubei would have increased by 47% and associated quarantine costs would double if that testing capability had not been achieved.
Wuhan Lab immediately followed the establishment of Huo-Yan Laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
By March 4, 2020, total daily productivity was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays has released open source, multi-transmitter designs that can test up to 1,122 samples for a patient to detect COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need for automated fluid treatments.
In March, the lack and inadequacy of reagents caused a stalemate when a large number of tests were conducted in the EU, the UK and the US.
This prompted some specialists to explore sampling protocols that include preheating samples at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the UAE was at the top of the world in terms of the ratio of testing of the coronavirus to most of its population.
This was through a combination of in-vehicle testing capability activation, and the purchase of a high-productivity laboratory with a range to suit the population of Group 42 and BGI (depending on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
Created within 14 days, the lab allows tens of thousands of RTPCR tests per day, the world’s first laboratory of this size to operate outside of China.
Different test methods have been developed targeting different parts of the coronavirus’ genetic features in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted the German plan to manufacture crews sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to create their own crews.
The German plan was announced on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until January 28, delaying the tests available in the US. China and the US faced problems regarding the reliability of test crews early on in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough health crews to meet the requests and follow the test recommendations.
Experts say the abundance of tests in South Korea has helped curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has significantly increased testing capacity in private sector laboratories over several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for an intensification of testing programs as the optimal solution to limit the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The increased demand for testing as a result of the widespread spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of tests to accumulate in private U.S. laboratories, as well as the supply of swabs and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, there were “defections” in the test kits created by CDC; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented testing in particular. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Ltd., but found the results to be inaccurate.
The company explained that incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or to improper use of crews.
The Spanish ministry said it would back down from buying kits that gave incorrect results, and replace them with other test kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x87> proposed tossing it into the Danube River. Professor A<0xC4><0x9F> Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health reported that the test kits Turkey purchased from China had a “high error rate” and they “prevented their use.” The UK also bought 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 declared them unusable.
The tests, which were followed by a quarantine of those who were found to be infected and a follow-up of contacts with SARS-CoV-2, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vue, which saw the first COVID-19 death in Italy, tested the entire population of about 3,400 people twice, taking about 10 days at a time.
Nearly half of the people whose tests were positive showed no symptoms, and all the cases identified were isolated.
As a result of the inter-municipal mobility ban, new infections have been completely eliminated.
Singapore’s 2020 coronavirus pandemic saw a significant reduction in prevalence compared to other developed countries, but without strict restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and retail establishments, through strict contact tracing and restrictions on inland travel, testing and quarantine.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has already begun urging residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools were reopened on March 23 in time after the holidays.
Several other countries also controlled the pandemic through strict contact tracing and restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent closures, such as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has revealed that countries with more tests, compared to the number of deaths, have significantly lower mortality rates, perhaps because these countries are better able to detect only mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capability or have local laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience send the first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO-approved laboratories to confirm the test.
Of the 16 accredited laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following diagram, the column “Positive in % of tests” is affected by the country’s test policy.
The country that tests only for people who have been hospitalized will have a higher percentage of positive cases than the country that tests for all its residents, whether they appear symptomatic or not, given the equality of other factors.
Handwashing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning hands for the purpose of removing dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Constant handwashing with soap at certain “necessary times” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral anal route.
People can also develop respiratory diseases such as the flu or cold, for example, if they have not washed their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
These include the five essential moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important: before and after defecating, after cleaning the baby’s back or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before eating, before preparing food or dealing with raw meat, fish or poultry and after.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after the meal.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing a baby's diaper or cleaning it after using the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching the animals, their feed, or their excrement.
Medical hygiene of the hands refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medications or providing medical care can prevent or limit the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to disinfect hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is particularly important for people who work with food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important procedure for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases, preventing diarrhoeal infectious diseases, and reducing respiratory infections.
Reduce infant mortality rates at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing practices may lead to minor improvements in height development in children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures that encourage hand-washing can reduce diarrhea attacks by nearly a third, similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of reduced episodes of diarrhea can be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI) when applying automatic behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major acute respiratory infections, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, with about 1.8 million children dying each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause about 3.5 million children to die each year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an inherent habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programs (water, sanitation and hygiene).
Washing hands also protects against herpes that are transmitted through direct physical contact.
Washing hands is a simple detrimental effect that frequent washing of hands can lead to skin damage due to its dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition of scaling and itching known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health care workers.
Too much hand washing is also often seen as a symptom of OCD.
There are five essential moments during the day when hand-washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of diseases through the oral anal route: after using the bathroom (pissing, defecation), after cleaning the baby’s back (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating, before/after preparing food or dealing with raw meat, fish or poultry.
The correct handwashing method should be practiced in other cases in order to prevent the transmission of the disease, such as before or after cutting or wound treatment, after sneezing, coughing or cleaning your nose, after touching or handling animal litter, and after touching rubbish.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap is low.
A study on the habit of handwashing children in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate, estimated at 97 percent, the U.S. approach the center at 77 percent, and China at the lowest at 23 percent. Many behavioral change methodologies are now in place in countries to increase the use of handwashing behavior in children.
The “Basic Health Care Program” implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of taking large-scale action to promote children’s health and education.
Twice a year, in addition to daily hand washing with soap and daily fluoride, helminth treatment is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to water promotes the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main effect of soap and detergents is to reduce dissolving barriers, increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective disinfectant for the skin because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, do not decompose easily in water.
However, the flow of the right amount of water helps to disinfect.
Hard soap, due to its reusable nature, may carry bacteria gained from previous uses.
A few studies that have observed a bacterial transition from contaminated hard soap have concluded that the transition is unlikely because bacteria are washed away with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still state that “it is preferable to use liquid soap than devices that work without touching to pump soap.”
Antibacterial soap has been widely promoted for health-conscious consumers.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended disinfectants or sterilizers is chosen to eliminate antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which does not affect a large number of strains of organisms.
So, if antibacterial soap does not affect antibiotic-resistant strains, it may not be as effective as it is marketed.
In addition to the superficial stress reduction bacteria and skin protection agent, advanced formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a regulator of acidity, active antimicrobial benzoic acid and other skin moisturizers (ordinary class of antimicrobial bacterium, vitamins, menthol, botanical extracts).
The hot water suitable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0> C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils that retain dust and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect in reducing microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a substance that is not water-based for cleaning hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol hand detergents, which are sterilized by rubbing (also known as alcohol-synthetic handwash, disinfectant handwash, or hand sanitizer), began to gain popularity.
Most rely on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol compound with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or a foam for ease of use and reduce the effect of alcohol-induced dehydration.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sterilizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective germicides.
Rubbing alcohol sterilizers kill bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus and vancomycin-resistant intestinal agents), tuberculosis, and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory cyclovirus, nasal viruses, gout, influenza and flu).
Alcoholic sterilizers containing 70% rubbing alcohol eliminate 99.97% (logarithmic reduction by 3.5, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on the hands after 30 seconds and 99.99% to 99.999% (logarithmic reduction of some bacteria against 4 to 5 bacteria on the hands with less than 1 minute of exposure.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against the Norovirus (or Norawalk) viruses, which is the most common cause of gastroenteritis caused by infection. Enough manual disinfectant or alcohol rubbing should be used to wet or cover both hands completely.
Rub the front and back of the hands and between all the fingers and limbs for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dries.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed, rubbing them at both ends. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends rubbing hands with hand sanitizer, especially when the hands are clearly dirty.
The increased use of these detergents is due to their ease of use and their rapid activity in eliminating microorganisms; however, they should not be a substitute for proper handwashing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless you add softeners, moisturizers, or both to the composition.
The effect of alcohol on dry skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients or both to the composition.
Clinical trials have shown that alcohol hand sanitizers containing emollients cause less irritation and dryness of the skin than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact dermatitis, contactary urticaria syndrome, hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives found in alcohol handwashing substances rarely occurs.
The reduced susceptibility of irritating contact dermatitis has become an attraction compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite the effectiveness of detergents that are not water-based, they do not disinfect hands of organic matter, but simply sterilize them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer is highly dependent on ingredients and composition, and historically, its effect has been significantly lower than that of alcohol-containing alcohol-based rubbing.
Recently, compounds that use benzalconium chloride have been shown to have a cumulative and continuous effect as an antimicrobial after use, unlike alcohol that has been shown to be low in effectiveness after repeated use, possibly due to progressive inverse skin reactions.
Many individuals in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or dirt instead.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if dust or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, they may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Ash, like soap, is also a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when it comes into contact with water.
The World Health Organization has recommended using ash or sand as a substitute for soap when not available.
The correct handwashing method recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
It is recommended to use running water because existing basins may be contaminated, and at the same time the water temperature does not seem to make a difference.
Make foam on your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands well when using soap instead of just water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and removes rubbing for longer periods of more germs.
Rinse well under running water.
Hands rinsing inside the pelvis may re-contaminate them.
Dry with a clean towel or leave it to dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are easily contaminated again. The most common parts that are overlooked are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish may contain microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands, and dry skin can damage it, which may increase the risk of transmission.
Various low-cost options can be provided to facilitate handwashing in developing countries, where tap water, soap or both are not available, such as pouring water from a suspended bowl or percussion with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary. In places with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to rationalize water consumption, such as “water taps and taps.”
A tepee tap is a simple technique that uses a pitcher hanging by a rope, a foot-operated control arm to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of hand hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing number of research suggests that paper towels are healthier than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European Textile Symposium on Paper Towels, to compare the levels of hygiene provided by paper towels, hand dryers with warm air, and newer hand dryers with jet air.
After washing hands and drying them with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average on the soles of the fingers by 194% and on the palm by 254%.
Drying with a jet air dryer increased the average total number of bacteria on the finger soles by 42% and on the palm by 15%.
After washing hands and drying them with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the soles of the fingers decreased on average by up to 76% and on the palm by 77%, and the scientists conducted tests to determine whether there was a risk of infection to other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which pushes air out of the unit at speeds of up to 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of inflating microorganisms from the hands and device, and may be transmitted to other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 metres away.
The use of a warm air dryer spreads microorganisms 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different hand drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed after drying the hands:
There are many different hand dryers manufacturers, and hand dryers are paired with paper towels.
Washing hands with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative during travel due to the lack of soap and water.
Alcoholic hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory for a long time after the Hungarian physician Ignats Semelves discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide notes to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found lower rates of infection using it.
Medical hand washing should be for at least 15 seconds, using abundant amounts of soap, water or gel to make foam and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together and fingers intertwined.
If there is litter under the fingernails, a brush with rough hair can be used to remove it.
Since germs may remain in the water on your hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids contamination of the hands again from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in a health care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and avoid their transfer.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that non-handwashing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors forgetting to wash their hands routinely before touching patients, moving microorganisms.
One study showed that proper handwashing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent, and the World Health Organization published a paper showing how to wash and rub hands in health care sectors.
The draft hand hygiene guidance document provided by the organization can also be found on its website available for public comment.
Whitby et al. conducted a related review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if necessary to demonstrate compliance with regulations.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has “five moments” to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
before a sterilization mission, and
After taking care of patients. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (“medical” or “antimicrobial”) gives an pesticide to the handwashing agent.
This extermination element may be desirable before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly proliferating. When "rubbing" someone's hands for surgery, a faucet that can be turned on and off without touching them with hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine washcloths, hand sanitizer and sterile towels are required.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2 to 6 minutes.
A long period of time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When rinsing, water should be prevented from returning from the forearms to the hands.
After you’ve washed your hands, dry your hands with a sterile cloth and wear a surgical gown.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash hands or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
To control staphylococci infection in hospitals, the greatest benefit of manual disinfection was found to come from the first 20% of laundry, and it gained very little additional benefit when the frequency of hand cleaning increased to over 35%.
Washing with regular soap leads to more than three times the rate of foodborne bacterial infections compared to washing with antibacterial soap. By comparing rubbing hands with an alcoholic solution to washing hands with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds, rubbing alcohol has been found to reduce bacterial contamination by 26% more than infected bacteria.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol handwashing to reduce H1N1 flu virus and crusty crusty pigments from the hands. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care settings may include educating employees about handwashing, increasing availability of alcohol handwashing, and written and oral reminders for employees.
More research is needed to find out which of these measures is most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as an essential tool at an affordable cost to achieve good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to come up with general hand-washing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, handwashing taps are rarely found near every private or public toilet, although there are cheap options for building handwashing stations.
However, low rates of handwashing can be caused by inherent habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating handwashing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term behavioural change for the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in lower middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is the “three-star approach” designed by UNICEF to encourage schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When minimum standards are met, schools can move from one star to eventually three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of the handwashing promotion campaigns undertaken to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaigns trying to achieve behaviour change. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji for handwashing.
A few studies have looked at the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries and its relationship to disability-adjusted life years.
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation procedures.
Handwashing was first recognized as important for human health – especially for people in critical conditions such as newly born mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals – in the mid-19th century by two of the pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Agn<0xC3><0xA1>nez Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna in Austria, and the modern Englishman Florens N<0xC3><0xA1>mez.
Most people at the time still believed that the infection was due to unpleasant odors called miasmaze.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health-care-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more effective hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect oneself from these infectious diseases.
For example, posters containing “right ways to wash hands” were hung next to handwashing in public toilets and in toilets in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase “washing hands from” means an advertisement of one’s unwillingness to take responsibility for the thing or engage in complicity in it.
It stems from a biblical passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands from the decision of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase that has a much wider use in some English societies.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Ms. Macbeth begins to wash her hands excessively in an attempt to cleanse a fictional spot that represents her guilt for the crimes she has committed and the crimes she has urged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after pointing out or thinking about unethical actions, tend to wash their hands more than others, and tend to appreciate hand washing tools more.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after this study are less likely to participate in other “cleansing” compensatory procedures, such as volunteering.
Religions describe handwashing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, using water without handwashing soap, is part of handwashing rituals that have appeared in many religions, including the Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> faith, Hinduism, typhilah, handwashing in Judaism, hand washing in Christianity and ablution in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.
Controls of Covid-19 Risks in the Workplace
Workplace COVID-19 risk controls are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for risk controls to prevent COVID-19 disease.
Correct workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and job function, based on risk assessment of exposure sources, the risk of disease in the community, and risk factors for working individuals who may be at risk for COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), businesses with a low exposure risk have minimal contact with the public and other co-workers, a condition in which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including handwashing, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, and keeping in mind the habits of coughing, sneezing, and sneezing.
Jobs with medium exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact with individuals who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but may become infected due to ongoing transmission in the community or international travel.
This includes workers who have reached out to the public, such as in schools, high labour-intensive work environments, and some large retail outlets.
Risk controls for this group, as well as basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing prevention barriers, and the use of personal protective equipment available in case of dealing with a person with COVID-19.
The Occupational Safety and Health Department considers health-care workers and body wallets exposed to a person known to or suspected of having COVID-19 at high levels of exposure, which increase the risk of exposure, which is very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures, collect samples from or deal with a person known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls such as passive pressure ventilation chambers and personal protective equipment appropriate for the job.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have multiple effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of illness, the need to care for others, or for fear of potential exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of the quality of the goods ordered, and the ways to get them (e.g., off-peak shopping or via delivery services or shopping without leaving the vehicle).
Finally, shipments of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may stop. A preparedness and response plan for infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive actions.
The plans address risk levels associated with different workplaces and functional tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors arising from home and community spaces, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines the controls needed to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national and subnational recommendations.
The targets of the outbreak response include reducing the transmission of infections among employees, protecting people most at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business processes, and minimizing negative impacts on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the society in which the business is located affects the responses taken.
A hierarchy of risk controls is a framework that is widely used in occupational safety and health to classify risk controls by effectiveness.
Because the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without relying on workers’ behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution in terms of implementation.
Administrative controls are changes in employment policy or actions that require action on the part of the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected based on the hazard to which the worker is exposed, proper fit as appropriate (e.g. breathing apparatus), wear continuously and properly, check, maintain and replace regularly, as necessary, and remove, clean, store, or properly dispose of pollution.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs that include lower exposure to risk have a minimum level of contact with the public and other co-workers.
The basic procedures for preventing infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and complete handwashing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, observing cough and sneeze etiquette including covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, providing tissue paper and garbage containers, and preparing for remote work and obligatory work shifts.
Immediate identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a crucial step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until fever, fever signs and any other symptoms go away for at least 24 hours without using antipyretics or other medications that improve symptoms, and that sick leave policies be flexible and allow employees to stay at home.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, jobs with an average risk of exposure include those requiring frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of individuals who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but may develop SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing transmission in the community surrounding the workplace, or because the person has recently made international travel to a site where the enemy is spreading.
This includes workers who are always in contact with the general masses such as in schools, high-intensity work environments, high-volume retail spaces. Engineering controls include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increase of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as the transparent plastic sneeze protectors, and the installation of windows to serve the customers who are in the process.
Employees in this risk group rarely need to use breathing devices.
If a person becomes sick while on board an aircraft, appropriate prevention controls to protect workers and other passengers include keeping the sick passenger away from others by 6 feet, assigning one member of the aircraft team to serve the sick person, and providing the sick person with a face mask or requiring the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing.
Crew should wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching body fluids or contaminated surfaces, and possibly use additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable purposes must be disposed of in the biohazard prevention bag, and contaminated surfaces must then be cleaned and sterilized. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include postponing travel when sick, self-isolation and informing the medical centre on board the aircraft immediately if a person is infected with fever or other symptoms.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in an isolated person’s cabin. For schools and childcare facilities, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is in the school building regardless of the prevalence in the community.
When there is a limit on transmission in the community ranging from limited to medium, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as cancelling field trips, gatherings, and other large gatherings such as physical education classes or band lessons or eating meals in the cafeteria, increasing distances between offices, organizing times of attendance and departure, reducing the symptoms of unnecessarily disconnected and unnecessarily disconnected children.
When there is a significant transmission of infection in the community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extensions of school departure dates can be considered. For law enforcement officials who carry out daily routine activities, the immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must communicate with individuals who have been confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of direct contact during arrest, workers should clean and disinfect work belts and tools before reusing them using a spray or home cleaning wipe, and follow standard working procedures to deal with pollution and dispose of used personal protective equipment and to collect and wash clothes.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, some health care workers and cadavers fall into categories with high or very high risk levels.
High-risk jobs include health care providers, support, laboratories, and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become extremely high risk exposure if workers perform aerosol generation procedures, as well as collecting samples from confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients or dealing with them.
Aerosol generation procedures include tubing, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental procedures and tests, or the collection of invasive samples.
The functions of the cadaver portfolio of high-risk bodies include workers involved in preparing the bodies of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 victims at the time of their death; those with a very high-risk level become exposed if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these at-risk groups include the generation of isolation rooms for patients known or suspected to be infected.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and the preservation of dead bodies.
Samples should be treated with level 3 biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends isolating patients arriving in separate waiting areas based on whether they are suspected of having COVID-19 or not. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends the use of respirators for those working within 6 feet of patients known or suspected to have SARS-COV-2.
In the United States, N95 filtered face mask respirators approved by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or better, should be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program, which includes a composition and suitability test, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of workers. The World Health Organization does not recommend using aprons, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted by body fluids.
The World Health Organization only recommends the use of a surgical mask for screening staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, take care of them, or transport them without any aerosol-generating procedures, the World Health Organization recommends the use of a surgical mask, goggles, or face-protective glasses, as well as scrubs and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the face mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 breathing mask.
Given that the global supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends that they reduce the need for personal protective equipment through telemedicine, and physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a patient with COVID-19, using the same personal protective equipment only necessary for the specific task, and continuing to use the same respiratory mask while still being taken care of by many patients.

Sending date/time: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: No rights reserved
We found ourselves in exceptional circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has become something that clearly demonstrates the global human interdependence and responsibilities we have towards others.
Our history has never experienced similar challenges, but we know for sure that the best response depends on some kind of global empathy, collaboration and community building, which are at the heart of this institution.
The intense friendship and care that we’ve seen among all our colleagues via emails, calls and conversations is a stunning demonstration of the amazing human emotions that, fortunately, surround the way we do business.
I am deeply grateful and deeply proud to be your true colleagues.
Last week, someone sent me a letter expressing appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of how important the world’s ability to move towards Wikipedia at the moment is, and the powerful symbolism of how this critical resource remains available online and accessible to all individuals.
Your efforts have made it possible, whether it’s through the continued operation of the sites, our colleagues getting paid, or providing safety to our communities.
The world is in dire need of information on Wikipedia more than ever before.
It’s a moment when the positive impact in the world is not just on our efforts, but also on the way we do it.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make major adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
Modifications to working methods and schedules
As Robin mentioned earlier, Team C met yesterday to discuss our method and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that discussion, we looked at what we thought could be the appropriate response to what we face, and the ideal way to sustain the organization’s business during this period.
We wanted with great enthusiasm to get rid of stress and stress, and to support our mission in the long term.
If you want to reduce the burden and tasks, that’s fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
The expected daily work period is 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We’re not announcing a holiday, so if you’re able to work longer than normal hours, you might add your efforts to the task.
However, the conditions of the world are now unpredictable, and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, get groceries, or go to the doctor, your safety is our top priority.
We don't keep track of your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
Allowing this should be understood without expressing it, but we mention it as confirmation.
No sick or paid leave is required, just inform your manager and help your team review calendars and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If your doctor has a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, please tell Brian at the Training and Certifications Department so that the Training and Certification Department can provide support and ensure that your condition is adequately cared for by the Department.)
Fellows working hourly are paid in full.
We have already mentioned that, and we renew this commitment to our obligations to our contractors and fellow hourly workers.
Each employee will be paid based on normal working hours during normal conditions.
This includes whether the employee is sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many individuals take advantage of the work to overcome the pervasive pressures in the world around us.
What we can do will be amazingly fruitful, especially during difficult times like this.
Again, it’s about taking care of the person for himself.
We only ask you to contact your manager so that they know what to expect and adjust the procedures to adapt accordingly.
Some work is necessary.
There are also some things that we need to keep going.
Site reliability engineering teams, HR operations, trust, trust, fundraising (and others) are doing critical work, which may require further support.
We will initiate a process in collaboration with all departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to supporting the elements necessary to achieve our mission.
There’s a lot of work to be done for all of us, and we’ll only focus on the most important projects.
Going slower now won't hurt us later.
We don't plan to "double the work time to make up for what's over" after the pandemic ends.
We are not expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are currently unrealistic.
We accept the fact that those circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and timetables when appropriate.
What happens in Annual Planning (APP)?
To adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the delivery schedule of our annual planning for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allow more time to design the budget to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and caring for loved ones while matching those who need or want to work within a reduced working time schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension of the schedule reduces the workload of current planning and pressure across the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and will update the delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.
We thank the annual planning team for their pioneering role in this matter.
Office condition, exposure and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, out of extreme caution and prohibition, we hired a virus-resistant cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
The team has used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and elevator units that lead to our floor.
The building implemented its own protocol of duty of care using products that support the safety of tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office is conveniently ready by the time we decide to return to work.
Our office in Washington, D.C. is located in a building belonging to WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and with all team members working at our Washington, D.C. headquarters.
Starting last week, our Washington, D.C. office moved to a completely remote location under the guidance of our San Francisco office.
As some of our colleagues at our headquarters in New York City know, we had a discussion about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed for some time.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that this may be an adjustment, and they may want to give you some advice:
Meeting time should be limited to a maximum of 1 hour or a gradual increase of up to 2 hours.
If longer sessions are required, think about how to divide them over several days.
The meeting should be clearly defined, an agenda prepared, and reading materials sent in advance.
Video should be made the default solution, and use tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct communication.
Each meeting should be facilitated, and one person will monitor the conversation to find out the questions and track the list of speakers, and another person to help take notes (or perform a collaborative note-taking process).
An email should be sent to technical support when needed for comfortable headphones.
The Health and Safety Compensation Program can be used to obtain the cost of snacks.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel in the Slack app to talk to colleagues about distributed work
Our HR Operations team is looking for user-friendly, meeting-based online mentoring to support the increase in our organization’s distributed business.
Over the past week, we have asked all community grantees to cancel all public events funded by Wikimedia, such as those of the editors of the online site Editathon until the World Health Organization announces the end of the pandemic.
We have told them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete agreed grant activities, and that no one will be fined for having to delay or modify these objectives.
Next week we will release additional follow-up guidance on Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The public sentiments that prevail in the global community are frayed between sadness due to turmoil, satisfaction with clarity and the ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and others.
In light of the progress made in these actions, the Crisis Response Team is working on designing a page in Meta Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and follow up all communication with it.
Stay up to date on COVID-19-related topics
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC, 07:00 Pacific time for the staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer questions, and spend time communicating with each other.
We have this experience together and are always ready to help as much as possible.
In the meantime, we may continue to obtain information from this email, and all other necessary information relating to COVID-19 available at Office Wiki.
The Crisis Response Team will keep these pages up-to-date and keep all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contacts with workers residing in the severely affected States.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key areas of work, coverage challenges or anything else you need help with, please do not hesitate to let us know and cooperate with the Crisis Response Team.

Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme binds to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lung, arteries, heart, kidney, as well as intestines.
Angiotensin 2 inhibitors the action of angiotensin inhibitor (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin 2 and increasing angiotensin (1–7), making it a promising drug in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is also an entry for some types of coronaviruses into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 is a metallic enzyme that contains zinc and is located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
Angiotensin-2 converter protein has a peptidase M2 range that has an amino tip, and a carboxylic chain of amino acid transporter end.
Angiotensin 2 is a single-scroll type 1 membrane protein that has active enzyme receptors present on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular part of the angiotensin-2 converted enzyme is separated from the transmembrane by an enzyme called chidaz, resulting in the release of a soluble protein into the bloodstream and then released through the urine.
Angiotensin 2 converter enzyme is found in most organs of the body: it is associated with the cell membrane of type 2 alveolar cells in the lung, in the intestinal cells of the small intestine, endothelial cells of the arteries and veins, as well as in the smooth muscle cells of the arterial smallpox in most organs.
The transmissible RNA of the angiotensin-2 converted enzyme is present in the cerebral cortex, schema, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The primary function of the angiotensin 2-converting enzyme is to act as a balancer of the angiotensin-converting enzyme.
The angiotensin converting enzyme stimulates the conversion of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2 vasoconstrictor.
Conversely, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 separates the carboxylic end containing amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin 2 (aspartite-arginine-valin-tyrosin-isoleucine-hestidine-prolysin-phenyl-alanine) and dissolves it in an angiotensine-converter.
The angiotensin-2 converting enzyme is separated into a number of other peptides including dys-arginine9 -pradrykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
Angiotensin 2 also regulates the membrane passage of a neutral transporter of neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and plays a role in Hartenb's disease.
The angiotensin-2 converting enzyme, as a transmembrane protein, is the main entry into cells for some coronaviruses, including human coronavirus NL63, SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the binding of Spike S1 to SARS CoV and SARS CoV-2 with the enzyme band of the angiotensin-2-transformed enzyme on the surface of cells leads to cellular regeneration and the transmission of the virus and the enzyme to the internal particles that are located in the cells.
This insertion process requires the formation of the S protein via the membrane, the host’s serine2 enzyme, which is still being tested as a potential treatment. This makes some assume that lowering the levels of the angiotensin 2 converter enzyme in the cells may help with infection resistance.
However, many specialized associations and self-regulatory bodies recommend continuing to use the usual angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as a treatment.
A systematic study and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors was accompanied by a marked 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the reference group.
Furthermore, “the risk of pneumonia decreased among those treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, who were at a higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke or heart failure.
The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors led to a reduction in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less robust compared to the overall risk of pneumonia.”
It is thought that the human recombinant angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (rhACE2) will be a new treatment for acute lung injuries, it has been found to improve the pulmonary blood distribution process, as well as oxygen saturation in pigs with acute shortness of breath syndrome induced by polysaccharides.
The half-life of the recombinant angiotensin 2 converter enzyme is approximately 10 hours, it starts working after 30 minutes, and its effectiveness (time period) continues up to 24 hours.
There are numerous indications that the recombinant angiotensin-2 enzyme is likely to be a promising treatment for people with intolerance to conventional angiotensin resonant system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors), and in diseases associated with an increase in angiotensin-2 in the blood. There are clinical trials under assessment, for the effect of angiotensin infusion.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications designed specifically to help track people in contact in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, meaning the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Numerous applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed to design applications for contact tracking.
Many have expressed concerns about privacy, particularly about systems that rely on geo-location tracking for app users.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they could integrate a function that supports these Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has published an app that allows citizens to check whether they have contact with people with COVID-19.
It is an app used by individuals in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, individuals use an app called TraceTogether.
A local IT association has designed the app, released it as an open-source application and is due to be delivered to the government. North Macedonia has launched StopKorona, a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected individuals and provide rapid response to healthcare authorities.
The Ministry of Communications and Technology in cooperation with the Ministry of Health has taken over the design of the application.
On April 14, 2020, the app was still waiting for the Google Play Store and App Store approval from Apple.
On April 12, the government reported that the contact tracking app was in the advanced development phase and could become available for distribution within weeks. Ireland and France are planning to launch a similar app, "StopCovid".
Australia and New Zealand are both considering designing apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app, as well as the Blue Tris protocol.Russia plans to roll out an app that uses the virtual geographic surrounding of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from Moscow residents, designed to make sure they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, a security engineering professor at the University of Cambridge, has mentioned a number of potential practical problems surrounding application-based systems, including false positive cases and potential ineffectiveness if the use of applications is limited to only a small segment of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious Coronavirus apps, Apple has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that can add Coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting it to only “official” or other reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance from the use of coronavirus applications, particularly with regard to whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will disappear as soon as the threat expires.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organizations also announced eight conditions for government projects:
Monitoring should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Extensions of monitoring and surveillance should include provisions relating to the determination of when to stop them;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
The security of the data and the confidentiality of the identity of the data holders should be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be determined by law;
Factors should be protected from abuse and the rights of citizens should be protected to address abuses;
The “effective participation” of all “relevant stakeholders” is required, including public health experts and marginalized groups. German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also issued checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the issue of ongoing monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from the device’s operating systems as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of using apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and allowing tracking avoidance.
In Israel, officials have adopted network-based tracking.
However, network-based solutions that have access to raw site data have potential big privacy issues.
However, not all systems with centralized servers need access to personal location data; a number of privacy systems have been created that use centralized servers for interconnection only (see the next section below).
In South Korea, officials used a non-application-based system to carry out contact tracing operations.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and includes this data to send SMS notifications to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made the location information publicly available, which it allowed due to the wide-ranging changes in information privacy laws following the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites.Countries, including Germany, have considered using both centralized and privacy-preserving systems.
On April 6, 2020, details on this matter have not yet been released.
Tracking privacy-preserving contacts is an applied and successful concept and is supported by robust research literature dating back to at least 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked to access privacy-compatible solutions, such as low-power Bluetooth (BLE) to record user proximity to other cell phones.
However, BEPB-PTT and other mobile devices have been a coordinating effort that includes both centralized and decentralized approaches, not an individual protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized approach tracking, privacy-preserved decentralized approach (DPB-PBT/DPT-3), and temporary communication numbers (TCB and IPN, formerly known as IP numbers).
In these protocols, personal identification data does not leave the device, and all matching processes on the device occur.
MIT Media Lab’s Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-preserving technologies when collecting location data or intersecting paths and using them to track the spread of COVID-19.
Based on the research learned from the March 2020 report “The Wicked Face of Apps: Maintaining Personal Privacy under the Epidemic,” SafeTrace’s platform for Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy-related technologies that also originated at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure device technologies to allow users to share sensitive site and health data with other users and administrators without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the Global Contact Numbers Tracking Coalition was founded by groups focused on what was a fundamentally similar approach and highly overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability between tracking and alert applications, a key feature to achieve widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the Blue Trees Protocol, which is used by the official government app, open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control mobile operating systems Android and iOS, announced a contact tracking initiative, claiming they will maintain privacy by combining low-power Bluetooth technology with privacy-preserving encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main techniques used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to roll out the system in three stages:
Tools to enable governments to create official privacy-preserving apps to track coronavirus
Integrate this functionality directly into Android and iOS as Google and Apple plan to solve the problems of continuous usage and monitoring by first distributing the systems through operating system updates and then by removing them in the same way as soon as the threat ends.
Repositioning a drug (also known as reuse, re-allocation, goal change or therapeutic transformation of the drug) is a re-definition of the use of an approved drug to treat a different disease or medical condition than was originally designed to treat it.
This is one of the methods of scientific research currently used by researchers to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research trends include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of corrosive plasma.The SARS CoV-2 virus contains approximately 66 drug-treatable proteins, each of which contains multiple bovine-binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable plan for the development of an effective antiviral drug that eliminates COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins for SARS KOV-2 are bipartisan protease, RNA polymerase based on RNA, helicase, S protein, and rebo phosphatase for adenosine diphosphate.
Hussain A.A. and others have studied several candidate compounds that have subsequently been improved and analyzed for similarity of their structure to approved drugs with higher similarity, with the aim of accelerating the development of a strong anti-sars cov-2 drug in his pre-clinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.

A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to access a compound associated with SARS-CoV-2.The scientific community has been criticized for channeling resources into re-targeting drugs specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) added Lubinavir/Ritonavir in the International Solidarity Experiment.
Gilead Sciences has developed the drug Remedycifer as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Remedycivir was later discovered to be an antiviral activity in vitro against many fibroids, mucoviruses and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiretroviral therapy is the development of resistance through transitions that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preclinical studies suggest that remdisifer may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.There are several current clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one of which revolves around people with moderate illness and the other is for patients with the most severe disease.
There are three clinical trials of antiviral vitamin C in hospitalized patients suffering from severe COVID-19 disease, as well as two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and an uncontrolled trial (Italy).

Experiments in Italy and China as well. See <0x23>COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a presumptive vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Although no vaccines have been completed for clinical trials, several attempts are underway to develop this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
There were five candidate vaccines in the first phase of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to significant investments and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-COV-2.
The requirements of the Coalition on Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations initiative for vaccine development, announced in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, widespread deployment and global reach.
In April, scientists from the Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations Coalition reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform objectives advanced to the first phase of safety studies include:
DNA (deoxygenated RNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (Phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, type 5 adenovirus carrier)
According to the scientists of the Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations Coalition reported in April, there are 115 candidates for a total of vaccines in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 announced, but with little public information available (presumably in the planning stage or in the planning stage).
Phase I and Phase II trials perform a preliminary safety and immunization test, usually randomized, placebo-controlled, and in multiple locations, with more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve a greater number of participants, including the reference group, and a vaccine efficacy test to prevent the disease, while monitoring the negative effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines under active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet under human evaluation (preclinical research is ongoing).
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the possibility of a molecular synapse vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins in order to stimulate an immune response.

Around the same time, the Canadian government announced <0x24>192 million specifically to develop the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a national “vaccine bank” of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported tests for PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine for COVID-19 in mice, stating that "S1 subunit vaccines of SARS-CoV-2 administered microscopic acupuncture triggered strong responses to specific antigen antibodies [in mice] after the 2 vaccines were clear from the start."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the School of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a candidate vaccine based on DNA as a possible nasal spray.
Using phages, RNA will be designed to reproduce inside human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to SARS-COV-2.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access IBM’s supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called undetermined effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease they are fighting against.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to register 4,170 healthcare workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess the efficacy of the vaccine using specific animal models for COVID-19, such as genetically modified mice with angiotensin 2 enzyme, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, suggests the need for level 3 biosafety containment measures to deal with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure uniform safety procedures.
SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome vaccines have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or protective vaccine for SARS that has been proven safe and effective in humans alike.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no approved vaccine against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.
When March spread, existing research on SARS was thought to provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and treatments against the Mars-Cove infection.
As of March 2020, there was one Middle East Respiratory Syndrome vaccine (based on RNA) that completed the first phase of clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines were under development, all of which were vaccines directed at the virus, and two vaccines directed at the Adenovirus (ChAdOx-MERS), one-V-Vac-V and one-MERS.
Social media publications have raised the conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 virus was known and that the vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by many social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequencing and vaccinations for other strains of coronaviruses such as SARS-causing coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagion caused by Coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The period between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases show mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million people were reported infected in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread between people during mixing, often by spray scattered when coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
When the spray is scattered during exhalation, it usually falls to the ground or surfaces rather than being contagious over long distances.
People may also get infected when they touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although it may spread before the onset of symptoms and in the late stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the polymerase chain reaction of intraday reverse transcription (RTBCR) through a nasal vasodilator.
Masks are recommended for people suspected of contracting the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary: some authorities recommend that they not be used, some see the opposite, and others must be used.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People with the virus may not show symptoms or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, exhaustion and shortness of breath.
Immediate medical care is recommended if emergency symptoms of difficulty breathing, pain or constant pressure in the chest area, disturbance, difficulty waking up, or blurred face or lips are present.
In less common cases, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying proportions.
Initially, some cases in China suffered only chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease may develop into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of carriers without symptomatic transmission has not yet been fully identified; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The percentage of people with no symptoms is currently unknown and is under study, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases did not show symptoms during their hospital stay.
China’s National Health Commission began listing unsymptomatic cases in the daily tally on 1 April; of 166 cases on that day, 130 (78%) were unsymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva may carry large proportions of the virus.
Talking out loud results in more spray than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore showed that coughing without mouth covering could result in a spray scattered up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that it can be transmitted by bio-aerosols, and testing samples from air collectors in the hallway outside individual rooms has yielded positive results for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and CPR, may cause respiratory secretions to be released in the form of a spray, and then the virus spreads through the air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through stools, it is thought that the risk is limited.The virus is more contagious when people experience symptoms; while it may spread before symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that despite some uncertainty about how easily the disease spreads, one person can infect two to three others in general. The virus remains stuck on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be present for one day on cardboard and for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on copper 99%.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and disinfectants are also effective provided they are used properly; soaps dissolve the protective fatty membrane of the virus and stop working, as well as rid the skin and other surfaces of it.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken an average of two days after hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and on the second day of the test, the sixth patient had the highest viral load.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome, first isolated from three people with pneumonia in the group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 shares its characteristics with related coronaviruses found in nature.
Outside the body, home soap kills the virus, destroying its protective membrane. SARS COV-2 is closely related to the original SARS COV.
The lungs are the two organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells by the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme, which is most abundant in type 2 alveolar cells found in the lung.
The virus uses a special superficial glycemic protein called Spike (a follicle) to communicate with ACE2 and enter the host cell.
12 per cent of the injured people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, had severe heart attacks, and were more common in critical cases.
The rates of cardiovascular-related symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute cardiomyopathy may also be associated with the ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptor plays a very important role in the heart and is involved in the performance of its functions.
Thrombosis (31%) and venous blood clots (25%) in patients in the intensive care unit with COVID-19 have increased, which may be linked to poor predictability of the outcome of the disease. Autopsies of individuals who died from COVID-19 have found diffuse sinus damage (DAD), and inflammatory infiltration containing lymphocytes.
Although SARS-COV-2 is geared towards ACE2-expressed epithelial cells in the respiratory system, severe COVID-19 patients experience symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, T cells that secrete pathogenic GMCSF have been found to be associated with bringing in the only cells that secrete inflammatory interleukin 6 and proliferating lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
There was also reported lymphatic infiltration at the time of autopsy.
The World Health Organization has published several test protocols for the disease.
The polymerase chain reaction of intraday reverse transcription (RTBCR) is the standard method of testing.
The test is usually done using respiratory samples taken from a nasal nasal smear; however, a nasal smear or a smear sample can also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but it requires taking two blood samples two weeks apart and the results are of simple direct value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and spread genetic sequencing so that laboratories around the world can independently develop PCR tests to detect the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past) were under development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experiment on the test showed that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first clinical care point test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested ways to detect infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Double-sided, multilobular, asymmetrical, and retro-peripheral diffuse laminated glass ovals are common features at the beginning of the injury.
A subthoracic spread and form of stone acetate (thickness of the lobe barrier with an uneven senescence filler) may appear and merge with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and Covid-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathological conclusions from the autopsy:
Microscopic examination: pleural inflammation, peritoneal inflammation, pulmonary hyperplasia and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pulmonary cell hyperplasia, large atypical senophageal cells, transient inflammation with lymphatic infiltration and the formation of multi-core giant cells
Acute pneumonia: diffuse sinus damage (DAD) with diffuse sinus secretions.
Pervasive alveolar damage causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoxia of blood.
Treatment of pneumonia: regulation of secretions in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC); white blood cell interaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eye, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, and it is recommended to use the inside of the elbow if a napkin is not available.
It is recommended to clean your hands well after any coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public places, partly aimed at reducing transmission of asymptomatic infections.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the mixing of people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and eliminating large public gatherings.
The divergence guidelines also include people moving at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from each other.
There is no known drug for its effectiveness in preventing COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of controlling COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as "curve flattening".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are clearly dirty, before eating, and after cleaning the nose, coughing or sneezing.
It is also recommended to use at least 60% alcohol-containing hand sanitizer when soap and water are not available only.For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO offers two formulations for local production.
Antimicrobial activity in these two compounds arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is “not an effective hand disinfectant.”
Add glycerol as a moisturizer.
People receive supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of contracting the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Personal hygiene and reliance on a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive therapies may benefit those with mild symptoms during the early stage of infection. WHO and China’s National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of those hospitalized for COVID-19.
Intensive care specialists and pulmonologists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various bodies in a free resource, the Critical Case Care book available online.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 has been available.
For symptoms, some specialists recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen as the first treatment.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that may result in spraying, such as intubation or manual breathing.
For healthcare professionals who care for people with COVID-19, CDC recommends placing the person in the isolation room from airborne infections (AIIR) as well as using standard precautions, mixing precautions and airborne disease precautions. CDC explains the instructions for the use of personal protective equipment (PEI) in the IEP.
Recommended tools: Personal protective equipment aprons, a respirator or face mask, eye protectors, and medical gloves. Breathing devices (rather than face masks) are preferred if available.
N95 respirators were approved for industrial installations, but the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of masks under the Emergency Use Licence (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a particular biological agent is uncertain in the case of uses for other unspecified purposes.
When masks are not available, CDC recommends using face masks or homemade masks as a last resort.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not degraded to the extent that they require artificial respiration or alternatives, but some cases do.
The type of respiratory support provided to people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure in hospital settings is actively studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided using high-flow nasal cannula or double-level positive pressure to the airway.
It is not known whether either of these options will benefit those with a critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to continue using invasive ventilation when available because this technique reduces the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal ducts.Critical conditions are frequent among older people (over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds for the population, which restricts the health system’s ability to cope with the sudden rise in the number of COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed artificial respiratory support, and 1.4% died.
In China, nearly 30 percent of those hospitalized due to COVID-19 end up in intensive care units.
Ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in people with COVID-19 and oxygen supply becomes more difficult.
Respirators need to have high pressure control and positive end-expiratory pressure to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respiratory system and thoracic pneumothorax.
High positive end-expiratory pressure may not be available in older respiratory systems.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs are in the clinical trial phase.
Rimdisever seems to be the most proselytizing.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, many of the drugs that are being tested have already obtained approval for other uses or are already in an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried in people with a critical condition.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that volunteers participate in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The Food and Drug Administration has granted a temporary license to use plasma recovery as an experimental treatment in cases where a person’s life is seriously or directly threatened.
He has not undergone the necessary clinical studies to prove that he is safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are required to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect ‘contacts’ using surveillance data and thus the risk of potential infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health officials.Big data analytics for mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected and mixed-up people in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled the security services to track the mobile phone data of those presumed to be infected with the coronavirus.
Action has been taken to impose quarantines and to protect potentially injured citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the combined phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, for research purposes and to prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Italy’s regional health commissioner, Giulio Galera, said mobile phone companies told him that “40 percent of people are still moving everywhere.”
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon on a weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Ms. Kirsty Kaljulaid, has also made a global call for innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may feel distressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of injury itself.
Rory O’Connor said: “Increased social isolation, loneliness, concern about health, stress and economic stagnation is a massive storm that is detrimental to people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may take a mild course involving minor symptoms or be asymptomatic, similar to other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract such as a cold.
Simple cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be more likely to have severe COVID-19 based on data for other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is still a lack of COVID-19 data.
In those most affected, COVID-19 may develop rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, sepsis, or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 are sepsis, abnormal clotting of the blood, and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Six per cent of those with COVID-19 who were hospitalized were diagnosed with an abnormal blood clot, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, while four per cent had impaired kidney function.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (aminotransmitters).
According to the same report, the average period between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, of which five were in hospital.
However, the average period between hospitalization and death for those taken to the intensive care unit was seven days.
In a study of early cases, the average period from the onset of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, and the overall incidence ranged from six days to 41 days.
In a study conducted by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the male mortality rate was 2.8 percent while the female mortality rate was 1.7 percent.
Histological anatomical examinations of pulmonary samples postmortem show diffuse spinal damage with cellular fibromexide excretion in both lungs.
Changes in viral cellular pathology were observed in alveolar cells.
The lung image shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Heart damage due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest was observed in 11.8% of the deaths announced by China’s National Health Commission.
According to data released by the United States in March, 89% of those hospitalized had previous illnesses.
Estimates of deaths resulting from the condition vary due to those differences between regions, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Underestimating simple cases can lead to an overestimation of mortality.
However, the fact that previous cases have caused mortality may indicate that the current mortality rate is lower than the truth.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to die than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority revealed a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some recovering patients, and lung tests indicated damage.
This may also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known if the previous infection was gaining effective, long-term immunity for those recovering from the disease.
Gaining immunity is seen as a potential, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but it was reported that there were cases of recovery from COVID-19 and then was later re-infected.
These conditions are thought to worsen if the infection persists more than when it is repeated.
The virus is thought to be natural and of animal origin, given the spread of the infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was largely a result of human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that December 1, 2019 was the first date of symptoms.
Official publications from the World Health Organization (WHO) have reported that December 8, 2019 is the first date for symptoms to appear.
Numerous measures are usually taken to determine the number of deaths.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the size of the tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time taken since the outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender and public health.
In late 2019, as part of the 10th review of the International Classification of Diseases, WHO designated U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 deaths and U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths diagnosed during SARS-COV-2 clinically or epidemiologically.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate from injuries is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which is the percentage of those who were detected and died of a disease, and the rate of infection mortality (IFR), which is the percentage of those who were detected and those who were undetected.
These statistics do not have a time frame, and they follow a specific population from injury to knowing the fate of the condition.
Although antibodies may not be produced by all infected bodies, their presence may provide information about the number of infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castell<0xC3><0xB3>n de Ada, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, has already killed 80 people (1.7%).
In Ganglett, the disease spread due to carnival festivals, and spread to young people, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and probably not all COVID-19 deaths were officially classified as a result.
Moreover, the German health system has not been exhausted.
In the Netherlands, about 3% probably have antibodies, according to an evaluation done on blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed due to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the resulting mortality rate vary between men and women.
The mortality rate is higher among men in studies in China and Italy.
The maximum risk for men is at age 50, with the difference between men and women disappearing at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of these sexual differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a cause.
Immune differences based on gender, non-prevalence of smoking among women and men with concurrent conditions such as higher blood pressure at a younger age than women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died of COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The highest proportion of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have an increased risk of HIV infection.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was COVID-19.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), explained that Ko is an abbreviation of the word Coronavirus, short for the virus and 19 for the year the outbreak was first discovered: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographical location (such as China), animal species or group of people, in line with international label recommendations aimed at preventing stigma.
In addition, the World Health Organization uses the terms “COVID-19” and “COVID-19 virus” in public statements.
The disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the coronavirus.
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as the Coronavirus and the Wuhan Coronavirus.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the use of the names novel coronavirus-2019 and acute respiratory disease associated with novel coronavirus-2019 as temporary names for the virus and disease in accordance with the 2015 guidelines that prohibit the use of sites in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS COV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to limited capabilities in standard supply chains, digital industrial companies export health care materials such as nasal swabs and breathing apparatus parts.
One example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve and the supplier could not deliver on time, a local startup reverse engineered it and issued the required 100 valves in one night.
After the first COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and quickly spread online.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of virus proliferation in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved medications or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government institutions, academic groups and industry researchers conduct international research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the “Solidarity Experiment” to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but different bodies are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Previous studies of SARS-CoV are used because it resembles SARS-CoV-2 in the use of ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are subject to study.
First, the researchers aim to create a complete vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to trigger an immediate immune response in the human body against a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the micro-unit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain micro-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS COV-2, this research focuses on the Spike S protein that helps the virus break into the enzyme ACE2 receptors.
The third strategy is DNA vaccines (DNA vaccines or RNA vaccines, a new technique to invent a vaccine).
The experimental vaccines resulting from any of these strategies should be tested to ensure their safety and effectiveness.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent adjuvant has been cited as a potential challenge facing the creation of the SARS Cove-2 vaccine, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven experiments have already been evaluated for approved treatments for malaria, including four studies related to hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The proposed re-use of antiretroviral drugs in the treatment of the new disease makes up most of Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials on remedicivir across several countries due to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of potential COVID-19 vaccines and drugs was carried out as of April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including rimedicevir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/itonavir combined with BET.
There is preliminary evidence of RimDecifer’s effectiveness, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with remdisifer for euthanasia.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, formerly used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 and has preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review for research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute for Virus Research notes that despite recommending a single gram dose, double that dose is very serious and may cause death.
On 28 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency license for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19.The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin, or omeprin for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS KOV-2 in vitro.
Further study of the effect of nitazoxanide on organisms has been recommended after it has been shown to inhibit the low concentration of SARS-COV-2.Studies have shown that the initial formation of Spike protein via transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRS2) is necessary to enter SARS-COV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have significant deficiencies that have prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without further study.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS COV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
A cytokine storm may be a complication in the late stages of acute COVID-19.
There is evidence that chloroquine hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties.The National Health Commission of China added Tosilyzumab to the treatment guidelines after completing a small study.
He undergoes a non-random Stage 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in those with severe conditions.
In addition to being used in a serum ferritin test to identify cytokine storms, it aims to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some patients.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adopted the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist T-cell therapy for the chimeric antigen, based on case studies to treat cytokine secretion syndrome for non-estrogenic non-responders that had a different cause in 2017.
To date, there is no disciplinary evidence that Tosilyzumab is an effective treatment for cytokine secretion syndrome.
The method of transporting purified and concentrated antibodies produced by immune systems from COVID-19 to those who need them is studied as a non-vaccine method of passive vaccination.
This strategy was tested on SARS and its results were inconclusive.
Virus neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can act as an intermediary for defense against SARS KOV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular toxicity based on antibodies, phagocytosis, or both, may be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
Production of the serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovering patients and contains antibodies specific to the virus, can be increased to spread faster.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wen Liang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, was subsequently infected and died of COVID-19 after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
