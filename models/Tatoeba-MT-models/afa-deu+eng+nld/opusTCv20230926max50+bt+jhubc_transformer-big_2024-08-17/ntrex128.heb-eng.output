Wales MPs Fear to Look Like Muppets
Some MPs were horrified by the proposal titled their role would change from AMs to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern arose following plans to change the name of the House of Repeal to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of Parliament throughout the political spectrum are concerned that this will be ridiculed.
One Labour MP said his people were worried it would "resonate with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
A member of parliament from the party of Plaid Camari said all of his members were “dissatisfied” and offered alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his friends were “open to suggestions” about the name change, but noted that the name MWP (the Welsh MP’s initials) sounded very similar to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is expressed in a similar way to the expression of the letter u in English in the Yokeshire accent.
The House Committee, which is currently drafting the legislation for the change of names, said: “The final decision on any word of description regarding the names of the members of the House of Representatives is, of course, the decision of the members of the House themselves.”
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh legislature the power to change its name.
In June, the committee released the results of the consultation with the public on the proposals, in which broad support was given to change the name of the legislature to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the role of MPs (AMs), the committee recommended the Welsh MPs, or WMPs, but the MWP option received most support in consultation with the public.
MPs are offering alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could cause a lot of headaches for committee chairman Aline Jones, who is due to submit draft legislation on the changes in the coming weeks.
Legislation regarding reforms will include other changes in the workings of the legislature, including rules for the removal of members of parliament and the structure of the committee system.
The vote of the members of Parliament is that they will ultimately determine the title of their role during legislative debates.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum on changing the country's name
Citizens will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia.”
The referendum was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Greece has long argued that its northern neighbor's name is a claim to Greece's territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the change of name, said he would ignore its results.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin’s Church remain silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in the Harlem neighborhood
According to Mr. Adams, “the old neighborhood residents say there was a bar and a church in every corner in the past.”
“Today there are no bars and no churches.”
He said the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
“People’s social lives today are going differently,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a regular basis.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the heads of the churches expect, “and sooner or later, they will find themselves again at the starting point.”
He said the churches would take the place of apartment buildings with shared houses that house people who are not the type to help neighborhoods maintain their unique character.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “so this will speed up the closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will join these churches.”
The two churches were built by white believers, before Harlem became a mostly black neighborhood - the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist community of believers left in the 1930s.
A community of black believers operating in the area became the owner of the building.
St. Martin’s Church was passed into the hands of a black community of believers under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 caused heavy damage to the building, but as part of the plans of the faithful under Reverend Johnson to rebuild it, they ordered the construction of the bell beam.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson Sr. and successor to St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the Curion “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played Kryon in July called him a “cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical tool.”
The expert, Tiffany Ing of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first bell chorus played by a black musician, Deoncio A. Linde, who later played the larger chorion at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that the Church of St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin’s Church over the past few months has been a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by the heads of the local church, and others by the episcopal bishopric.
The assembly, which is the governing body of the community of believers made up of local believers, wrote to the bishops in July in a letter in which she shared her concerns that the bishops would "try to roll over the costs" to the assembly, even though the assembly was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some of the faithful complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishops.
Shark Wounds 13-Year-Old Boy in Lobster Dive
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as the boy dived to catch lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowed there with a group to help pull him ashore.
At first Hummel thought it was only a shout of enthusiasm for a lobster, but later he realized that the boy was screaming, “I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
Hamel said that as he approached the boy, he saw that "all his collarbone had been ripped off."
“I shouted to everyone out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was flown to the Rady Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as humane.
It is not known what type of shark attacked the boy.
Rescue chief Larry Giles said in a press briefing that a shark had been identified in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a shark of a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Authorities have closed access to the coast between Punto Beach in Bessbad and Swami Beach in Asinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to penetrate UK beauty products market
Sainsbury’s starts a competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opens department store-style passes with professional saleswomen.
As part of a major initiative to penetrate the UK beauty products market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion a year and continues to grow as sales in fashion and home products decline, the extended transits of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be added to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty products comes as supermarkets look for ways to use the shelves space previously captured by televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury’s said the company is expected to double its supply of beauty products to up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time in its history.
Existing product lines of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also gain additional territory with dedicated brand areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its makeup line – Boutique – so that most products will be vegan-friendly, a feature that is in increasing demand among young shoppers.
Fragrance Shop will also test franchises at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, last week and the second at Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and beyond buying smaller amounts of food every day at local convenience stores requires supermarkets to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the branches would become more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off the cheap chains Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has added Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores as well as several Habitat points since it acquired the two networks two years ago, adding to its claims that it has boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the network to revive its beauty products and pharmacies ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the engagement ended after a dispute over how to divide the profits from pharmacies within supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmacy business at 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the program, she said, by expanding the brand offering of luxury skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve made a difference in the look and feel of our beauty product transitions, to improve the environment for customers.
In addition, we have invested in highly trained employees who will be available for advice on the spot.
Our brand offering is tailored to suit every need and our attractive environment and convenient locations make us an attractive destination for purchasing beauty products, challenging the old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones Annoyed After Holly Willaby Cancels <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones expressed "angry" after TV presenter Holly Willaby canceled an 11-million-pound deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV
Actually, Willoughby doesn't have time for a brand of their home clothes and accessories.
The joint venture of the two is similar to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced her departure in an Instagram post.
Holly Willaby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by canceling her participation in the two’s prestigious lifestyle brand at the last minute – to focus on her oily contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones reacted "in rage" when the TV star announced during a turbulent meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that due to her new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 - she didn't have enough time to devote to the brand of their home clothes and accessories.
The pair's joint venture was considered similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While 37-year-old Willabi posted on Instagram that she was leaving True, Jones was on a flight from the UK to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source, “Truly was without a doubt Holly’s top priority.
This was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her with income in the coming decades.
The decision to leave completely surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
The company’s warehouses at Marlowe are full of products ready for sale.”
Experts believe that leaving This Morning’s host, one of Britain’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions as a result of massive investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to household clothes, and the potential for further delay in launch.
This can lead to the end of a long friendship.
Willabi, who is the mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Kapp for ten years.
Willabi founded True with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the company’s chairman in March.
The couple spent holidays together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s television production company.
Willabi will become M<0x26>S brand ambassador and replace Annette McFartlin as a presenter on I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t comment on his business matters.”
It was a difficult conversation, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he received from the news media of what some define as “non-presidential” statements and that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said in the voice of a “news presenter.”
“I didn’t make any concessions.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after praising their first meeting in June as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearisation.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a “responsive response” from the United States to North Korea’s initial disarmament measures.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues with sanctions designed to continue the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic viewpoint in his speech at the rally.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We almost went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results — stopping missile tests, helping to free prisoners and bringing the remains of American soldiers home.
And he defended his extraordinary approach when he spoke about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full stadium, we had about 200 people standing there,” Trump said.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have destroyed an island and killed hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has lost their homes, no national disaster has been declared, which is a condition for accelerating international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they weren’t asking for international assistance, so it’s a little challenging,” Ms. Sombong said.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palo, it is not yet clear whether foreign envoys will be able to pass through the area.
Mr Sotopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if more international services would contribute to the relief effort.
In light of the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country unfortunately remains insufficiently prepared for natural disasters.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh County, they are rare in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami warnings in Palu, despite a warning, contributed to loss of life.
Even at the best of times, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship in Lombok to take care of the victims of an earthquake is making its way to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
Improving Indonesia’s weak infrastructure is at the center of President Joko Widodo’s campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But Mr. Joko is facing funding shortfalls for his run for re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faced the pressure of ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia as a result of the religious radicalization of the country’s Muslim majority.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have lost their homes in battles between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets – using knives, bows, arrows and other household weapons.
Video: Liverpool’s Daniel Stradge compares last-minute against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Stridge received a pass from Shakiri’s office when he was about 30 meters from Chelsea’s goal and his team were 1-0 behind.
He bounced the ball to his left and then turned a kick towards the far beam.
The ball flew high above the deck and landed towards the upper right corner of the net.
Eventually, the ball landed over the goalkeeper Capa Arizalga, who jumped at him, and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position, to get to the ball and players like Shack always play as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as I could,” he told Liverpool FC.com.
“I saw Kanta and I made one touch and didn’t think about it too much and just kicked.”
Chelsea led 0–1 in the half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The "Blue" forward gave a pass back to Mateo Kovacic in the same game, before turning close to the middle of the field and running quickly into Liverpool's half-court.
Kovacic performed a quick give-and-go maneuver in the middle of the field.
And then he kicked a beautiful cross-kick, which led Hazar into the expanse.
Hazard ran ahead of the defense and finished with the ball in the top right corner of the goal, with a left kick that passed Liverpool player Allison Becker.
Livepol will face Naples in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said Sunday morning.
Many people have been reported trapped in the wreckage of buildings that collapsed in a 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday that caused waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sotofu Furuo Naroho told a news conference.
The city of Palo, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
Police have opened a murder investigation after a woman's body was found this morning in Bikanhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed in John Street at 7.55 a.m., and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling people from the area who have seen or heard anything to contact her.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at the beginning, but I would like to urge anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something with a car camera, to contact us – because the footage may contain information that is essential to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a building.
Friends who believed they knew the woman came to the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police have announced that they are now in the process of sending messages to relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mewes had just tried to get into his apartment, but was told that police were barring anyone from entering or leaving the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will be hours before they can return to their apartments.
A policeman is heard telling one person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman was seen at the scene crying.
She goes back and mutters, “It’s terrible.”
At 14:00, two police trucks were spotted inside the scene and another outside.
Several policemen were standing inside the scene pointing at people in the apartment building.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message on Twitter to <0x40>MerPolCC, dial 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers at 111 555 0800 and specify the calendar number 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell's parliament statue has become the next target for attacks on monuments in the struggle over 'rewriting history'
The removal of the statue will be poetic justice in light of the removal of the ‘Taliban’ carried out by Puritan supporters of so many cultural and religious artifacts in England
But the Cromwell Society argues that Mr. Crick’s proposal is “stupid” and “trying to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that in the current dispute over the removal of statues, the character of Oliver Cromwell standing outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The destruction of the statues of the Civil War in England was not done at Cromwell's command and was not carried out by him.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell falls victim to the actions of one of his predecessors, Thomas Cromwell, in the century before.
Cromwell's impressive representation in the hands of the sculptor Sir William Hamo Thorncroft is a testament to a 19th-century view and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe deserves to be honored.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell was perceived by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as defending Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
The question of whether this is an entirely accurate estimate is a subject of ongoing historical controversy.
The unquestionable fact is that the struggle in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one identifiable figure representing one side of the barricade at the time.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of respect and honour.”
Deadly pig drives Chinese farmer to death
Local media sources report that a pig attacked a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified by his last name, Yuan, was found dead with a torn artery covered in blood near the pig shed at the Bloppenshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
Farmer prepares to inject pork vaccines on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in <0x58>ining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day his cousin found him dead and found a door to a pigsty nearby open.
He said there was a big male pig with blood on its mouth.
A criminal investigation confirmed that the 250-pound pig attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My uncle’s legs were full of blood and severed,” said the cousin whose last name was “Wow,” as quoted in Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market Thursday morning at 4.40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to either the yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked behind bars to prevent him from attacking other people as police gather evidence at the scene.
It was reported that negotiations were under way between Yuan’s family and market authorities regarding compensation for his death.
Although the phenomenon is rare, cases have been reported in the past in which pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a husband on their Massachusetts farm, causing serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had pinned a farmer in Wales to his tractor until the farmer's wife had smuggled out the beast.
After an Oregonian farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the taste of blood could be “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They're like naughty, very inquisitive kids... They don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to give them the right amount of respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in large areas of the southwestern United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over cooler waters on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring flooding rains across northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
The winds in Hurricane Rosa reached a speed of 135 km/h, meaning a Category 1 hurricane, and as of Sunday morning at 5am East Coast time, the epicenter of the storm is 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an aqueduct is starting to form over the Pacific Ocean moving eastward toward the U.S. East Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push deep tropical humidity north into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical humidification that will integrate with the approaching stream will generate heavy rainfall in large areas of the southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 millimeters of rain will cause flash floods and endanger desert landslides.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall to reach 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 50 to 100 mm is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially in Arizona.
Flash floods may occur with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It is highly recommended to avoid walking long distances in the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and dust storms.
The approaching river will bring local rainfall to parts of the southern California coastline.
There could be total rainfall of over 13 mm, which could lead to debris drifting and smooth roads.
It will be the first rain in the region this rainy season.
Tropical rains will start approaching Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, and the rain will intensify and spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, there may be sharp temperature changes across the U.S., while the Arctic is cooling, but the tropics remain rather warm.
This often leads to dramatic temperature changes between short distances.
On Sunday there is an excellent example of extreme temperature changes across the U.S. center.
There are temperature differences of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis to Des Moines, Iowa.
In the following days, prolonged summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
By the beginning of October, temperatures will be warm in most of the central and eastern regions of the United States, ranging between 27 and 31 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
In New York City the temperature could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 5 degrees above the average.
Long-term weather forecasts show higher-than-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday, on six television networks, the fascinating testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blazy Ford.
Meanwhile, the political debate continues, with news stories in the middle of regular broadcasts to announce a surprising development on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was touching her body drunk and trying to undress her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers was even higher than the reported 20.4 million viewers on the Nielsen Index.
Nielsen tested the average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time measuring people watching in offices.
By comparison, the audience is on a similar scale to the football playoffs or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen data, Fox News Channel, whose interpretations strongly support Cavanaugh’s appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
The level of interest remained high after the hearing.
Senator Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of appointing Cavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS photographers as a group of protesters yell at him as he tries to get into the elevator to reach a hearing at the legal committee.
He stood with a low gaze for a few minutes as the protesters denounced him, all of which was filmed live on CNN.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, “You have power while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would say more at a committee hearing.
Broadcasting networks and cables all broadcast live a few hours later, when the Legal Committee was about to vote on Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would vote for the nomination only if there was an understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate next week, which members of the Democratic minority demanded.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Connes.
After a conversation with Koons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have a majority to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without an investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused her critics of playing politics on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with Britain’s future and harming the national internet in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In an interview that featured the idea alongside her on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her “game of checkers” program to Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the European Union would levy each other’s tariffs was “completely unfounded.”
Wade Simms Shooting: Police Arrested Deaton Simpson as Suspect of LSU Player Murder
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the LSU team.
A 20-year-old man named Deaton Simpson has been arrested and jailed for first-degree murder, police say.
Officials released a video of the clash between Simms and Simpson, and according to police, Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said Simpson's DNA was found on them, according to WAFB, which is part of CBS.
After Simpson's investigation, police said he confessed to shooting Wade to death.
The bail was set at <0x24>350,000, as reported by Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Department's Pathological Institute published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and into the neck.
Police have given credit to the Louisiana State Police fugitive catching task force, the state police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and local citizens who helped in the investigation that led to the capture of the suspect.
LSU Athletics Director Joe Alva thanked law enforcement in the region for “cautiousness and the pursuit of justice.”
Simms was 20.
Forward, who was more than 2 meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “horrified” and “shocked” by Wade’s death.
“That’s what they’re afraid of all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano emits ash on Mexico City
Ashes emitted from the Popocateptal volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the mountain valley increased and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
In the center, a number of noises and tremors were observed.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash coverings on windshields of cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity on the volcano 72 km (45 miles) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists as anniversary of independence vote approaches
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police forces to disperse the protests, and thousands joined protests to mark the party's first anniversary of the Catalan independence vote.
A group of masked separatists blocked by police to disperse demonstrations, threw eggs at police officers and scattered powder to create black dust clouds on the streets that were usually crowded with tourists.
Confrontations also broke out later that day when policemen were forced to use batons to overcome the protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “Never Forget, Never Forgive” against the supporters of unity called “Long Lives of Spain.”
The local press reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained by the protesters.
Tensions remained high in pro-independence areas a year after the October 1 referendum was illegally tried by the Spanish government, but celebrated by pro-independence Catalans.
Voters voted by a large majority to become an independent state, although the percentage of votes cast was low when those opposed to secession boycotted the vote.
Government authorities in Catalonia reported that nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent polling across the region from taking place in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups set up overnight camps on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different course.
Narcisse Thermos, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost hope about Catalonia's chance of independence.
“Last year we had our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although the Catalan separatist parties won an important, though pressing, victory in last December's election, they struggled to maintain momentum this year with many of their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or prisons awaiting trial for their part in organizing the referendum and following the declaration of independence.
Juan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration of police support on his phone, said the confrontation was being ignited by politicians on both sides of the row.
“It’s getting worse,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriole Yonkers, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison waiting for trial since late last year, said he would run for European Parliament next year.
“To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the oppression that we have witnessed from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Several men arrested after car crashed into house
Three men – aged 33, 34 and 39 – were arrested after a car crashed into a Londonderry house several times.
The incident took place in Bellinagarg Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 UK time.
Detective investigator Bob Bellmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
It is also possible that at some point an arrow from an archer was shot at the car.
Manga kick gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Manga's first goal for Livingston secured victory.
Livingston, who has just stepped into the league, stunned Rangers and coach Stephen Gerard, which is only his second loss in 18 games as Ibrox manager.
Dolly Manga's kick meant a lot because Gary Holt's team moved to second place with Hibernian.
Gerard’s team is left without a win outside the Premier League this season, and will face captain Harts, behind whom she is eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is extending home losses to six games, and head coach Holt has not yet experienced a break since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed chances against a poor host
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before they hit a goal, when their directness caused Rangers various problems.
Scott Robinson broke forward but dragged his attempts in front of a gate, and then Alan Lithgoy could only focus his efforts laterally after he slipped in to meet Craig Helgett’s bump in front of the gate.
The hosts were willing to let Ranger play in front of them, knowing that they could make it harder for the team to host with free kicks.
And that's how the decisive gate came about.
The Rangers took a free kick and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to block Manga, who made a touch and scored a goal from the center of the square.
At this point, the Rangers controlled possession of the ball but discovered that the house’s defense was impenetrable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained virtually unthreatened.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos did force Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pitnam was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lithgoy touched a wide ball from another free kick by Livingstone.
Crossbows continued to enter Livingston's plaza and to stop, while two penalty bullets—after a foul by the Collector on Glenn Middleton, and one on a hand-touch—were kept away.
'Amazing' from Livingston - Surgery
Alastair Lamont, BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Amazing game and amazing result from Livingston.
All the players were excellent, and continued to exceed expectations in this upward swing.
Their style of play and the staffing of the players has hardly changed since their return to the leading position, but Holt must be given much credit for the way he has formed the team since his arrival.
He had so many stars.
Captain Holcott was great, and led a remarkably organized defense, while Manga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Waral on high alert throughout.
But the Rangers were uninspired.
Although they were sometimes pretty good under Gerard, they didn’t meet those standards.
They missed the final ball – only once they opened the home team’s defense – and that was a red light to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
A mixed reception for Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne
There were smiles and a blue sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday.
This is the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s controversial visit to Germany, whose goal was to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
They were divided on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's admission to the European Union.
From there, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an continued to participate in the opening of a new huge mosque.
Cologne is the most populous city outside Turkey.
Police announced security reasons for blocking 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters, many of them Kurds, have also voiced their voices, protesting both Erdogan’s policies and Germany’s decision to welcome him in the country.
The opposing protesters reflect the controversy surrounding the guest that some Turks in Germany praise as a hero and others condemn as a tyrant.
Car crash in Deptford: Bicycle rider killed in car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Stewood and Evelyn, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 p.m.
The driver stopped and paramedics treated the injured man, but the man died.
The collision came after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childer Street, about a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
Police said police were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Instead of checkpoints and buses headed for alternative routes, drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lattin Prison: Six Prisoners Wounded in Riot
Six guards were injured in a riot in a secure men’s prison, the prison’s office said.
The riot broke out at Long-Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9:30 a.m. and is still ongoing.
Special officers from a tornado unit were brought to the scene to eliminate the riot, which included eight prisoners and was intercepted into one wing.
The guards were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially skilled guards have been recruited to deal with an ongoing incident at Long Lertin Prison.
Six guards were treated for injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those involved will be handed over to the police and their prison terms may be prolonged.”
Long-Lattin Prison has 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor was treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which guards were attacked with snooker sticks.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It's rare that a tropical depression hits Arizona, but that's exactly what's expected to happen early next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cross the southeast desert and bring with them the danger of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already declared a threat to flash floods on Mondays and Tuesdays for western Arizona into southeastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to cross a direct course over Phoenix on Tuesday, and approach at the end of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that “only 10 tropical cyclones have been left in the status of a tropical storm or a tropical depression in the range of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 60 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the Arizona Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm on the edge of the Mogulon of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to receive 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated areas receiving a total of 50 mm.
For those outside of a flash flood-threatening area, the Rosa rain may be a blessing because the area has suffered from drought.
Although floods are a serious danger, some of these rains will be helpful because the southwest region is currently suffering from drought.
According to U.S. drought monitoring, over 40 percent of Arizona is in severe drought, which is the second-most severe category,” according to weather.com.
First, Rosa's orbit will reach land across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa, still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at about 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, and therefore weakens.
It is therefore expected to land in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm in the afternoon or in the evening of Monday.
Rains across parts of Mexico could be heavy and cause severe flooding.
“Total rainfall of 75 to 150 mm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with a chance of up to 250 mm,” weather.com reports.
Rosa will then continue into Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then continue across Arizona into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The main danger expected from Hurricane Rosa, or its remnants, is heavy rainfall in Baja California, southwestern Sonora, and the southwestern U.S. desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods and life-threatening waste streams in the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsmart Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsmart Norton on Sunday at around 04:00 UK time.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remained in a “stable” condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, according to the statement.
The police are asking anyone who might have cellphone footage of what happened to contact the police.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘suffered the convictions and anger’ of the Democratic Party
“A vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the rudeness and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “tolerated the convictions, the anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally denying the accusation that he sexually assaulted Kristin Blazy Ford decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her accusation.
The president said on Saturday that “the people of the United States saw the brilliance and quality and courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to confirm the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm the appointment of one of the most outstanding legal minds of our time, a courtman with an excellent history of public service,” he told his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republicans coming to the polls.
“Five more weeks until one of the most important votes of our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I’m actually a candidate,” he said.
“That’s why I’m running around fighting for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to “resist and interfere.”
A senior Republican aide told CNN that the first central procedural vote in the Senate plenum on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds Killed in Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami, Number Rises
At least 384 people were killed, many of them swept away in huge waves crashing on the beaches as a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, official sources reported Saturday.
Many people gathered for a beach festival in Palo on Friday, when waves of 6 meters (18 feet) high crashed on the beach at sunset, sweeping many to their death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was caused by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat woke up yesterday, people were still on the beach and not immediately fleeing, and they fell victim,” said Sutofu Furu Noroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster agency, at a briefing in Jakata.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground,” Noroho said, adding that the tsunami had advanced over the open sea at a speed of 800 km (497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and they survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air footage released by the disaster agency showed destruction to a large number of homes and shops, curved bridges and courses and a mosque surrounded by water.
Sub-shaking continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s powerful earthquake was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
According to him, the geography of the city, which sits at the edge of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Noroho described the destruction as "enormous" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Noroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along northern Palu with a 300-kilometer (190-mile) coastline, an area called Donegal, which is closer to the quake’s epicenter.
“The media has completely collapsed and there is no information,” Donegal said.
More than 300,000 people live in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its people and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not announcing a tsunami hit Palo, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video posted on social media, you can see a man on a high roof of a building shouting hysterical warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes on the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
The Reuters news agency was unable to immediately verify that the footage was authentic.
The quake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that cut off communications around Palo and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending transport planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the survivors still desperately needed food and other essentials.
The city's airport is only open for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit rescue centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's very difficult.
As World Vision from Donegal safely arrived in the city of Palo, where workers sheltered in tarpaulin shelters set up in their office yards, they passed through sights of destruction on their way, Mr. Dosba said.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's very difficult.
Even as aid groups began the unfortunate operations of the disaster relief gear, some complained that the arrival in Palo of experienced foreign aid workers was prevented.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and people can only begin to flow from other countries if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
This thing hasn't been done yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Olia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we will be able to open the door to international aid, but that status has not yet been declared.”
As the second night fell on Palo after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people clung to the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that illuminate the grim stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman buried under rubble for two days, with her mother’s body next to her.
Gandon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped at the Hara Rai Hotel, including Mr. Mendegi, were his students.
“I’m a paragliding veteran, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gandon recalled how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Wraith Hotel had spread among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palo, who took part in the beach festival.
But his messages showed only one gray check mark, instead of a pair of blue marks.
“I think that means the messages haven’t been delivered,” he said.
Thieves Take <0x24>26,750 While Filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed <0x24>26,750 from a Brinks employee who filled an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to bring more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While busy, another man “runs behind a Brinks employee” and stole a bag with money to fill in at the ATM.
A witness saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not detail how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The entity that was known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used the nickname as his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He is replacing singer Ariana Grande, who has cancelled for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
In addition to the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, when he talked about his album name with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
<0xE2><0x99><0xAA> So I'm you, I'm us, that's us <0xE2><0x99><0xAA>
It went from Kanye, which means the one and only, to “Ye”—just a reflection of the good in us, the bad in us, or the confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He's one of a few famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Coombs became known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names ‘love’ and ‘brother love’.
West’s former partner, Jay-Z, also switched between versions of his name with and without a hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's president has vowed not to use the military against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday in Teltolco Square that he would “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
Military forces fired at a nonviolent demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when leftist student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
Lopes Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing financial support to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China’s AI business grows, the U.S. needs to double the amount it invests in AI research, says AI researcher Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after various parts of the U.S. government issued statements about artificial intelligence, even when the U.S. government has no official artificial intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be number one in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” he said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances that the next big AI feat will be achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in the most prominent artificial intelligence company in China<0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the first-ranked Reversey player in the U.S., and later served as a senior director at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when you’d be next to help identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win government grants, he told me.
“It’s not China that’s taking us to the leading researchers in the academy, it’s the business companies that are doing it,” he told me.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have in recent years recruited stars from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. bolster its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think we should automatically offer a green card to those with a PhD in artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its next-generation AI development program.
The National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute grants to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a joint artificial intelligence center to engage industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an artificial intelligence initiative under the name AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently spends more than <0x24>100 million a year on AI research.
Meanwhile, a U.S. legislative initiative to create an artificial intelligence committee has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change its name to “Republic of North Macedonia,” a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that prevented it from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims its northern neighbor's name is a claim to Greece's territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the European Union.
The two countries signed a deal based on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents say the change would harm the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign called into question whether the number of voters would stand at the 50 percent minimum required for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the ballot paper reads as follows: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the European Union upon the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, say it is a price worth paying so that Macedonia, one of the countries created by the dissolution of Yugoslavia, can join bodies such as the European Union and NATO.
“I came today to point out the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live in freedom under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safe life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olibra Georgesbecka in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will comply with the results of the vote to make it a fixer.
To change the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no irregularities right at 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout stood at just 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 percent of the eligible voters came to vote.
“I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Jos<0xC3><0xA9> Tanevsky, a voter in the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorika and his son Dushko are terminating their vote in Stromica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, in the Macedonian referendum on the name change of the country, which will open the door to joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Skopje House of Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawderkov prepared a small stage and chairs in front of the tents erected by those who boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with a straight head, not through the entry of the servants,” Kaverderkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zayev said NATO companies would bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
“I believe the vast majority will be in favor of more than 80 percent of our citizens supporting the European Union and NATO,” he said.
He said a positive result would be “security of our future.”
A survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – less than the required percentage.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television network Telma TV, found that 57 of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote “yes.”
For the referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be at least 50 percent plus one.
Failing the referendum would be the first significant loss of pro-Western government policy since it seized power in May last year.
Video: Manchester City player, Sergio Aguaro, navigates through all of Brighton’s defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguaro and the Sterling brothers broke Brighton’s defense in a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Itihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed that Aguaro was taking the gate lightly.
The Argentine pioneer received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defensive players before breaking into the open field.
At this point, Aguaro found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before running for several more shields on the Brighton Extension boundary.
And then he kicked a boat to the left, and he found Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch on the pitch to deliver the ball back to Laguerreau, who kicked in the right leg and beat Brighton's goalkeeper, Matteo Ryan, with a ball on the right side of the net.
“Aguaro is suffering from foot problems,” Manchester City’s director told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Content the initial advantage of a Premier League rivalry.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguaro got the ball deep in Brighton's territory during this.
He sent a great ball across the right flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sana dribbled the ball before leading Sterling to the far beam.
The Blue Sky player pushed the ball into the net just before he slipped off the field.
Manchester City will face Oppenheim in the Champions League home game on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rain-Necker Stadium in Zinheim, Germany.
Sharzar wants to play spoiler against the Rockies
With the Nationals leaving the playoffs, there was no good reason to force another start.
But a highly competitive Sharzar hopes to win on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it still has implications for the Rockies, who lead one game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies secured at least an open ticket with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but had not yet secured the first place at home.
“Although we’re playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the spectators and the second team will probably play at the highest level at whatever point I face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to deal with that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starter for Sunday, but they reportedly tend to let Charzer serve in such a situation.
Charzer, who will be his 34th start, held a Bulpen training session on Thursday and will serve on his rest day - Sunday.
Washington's right pitcher has an 18-7 record with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikes in 220 rounds 2/3 of the season.
Trump has a rally in West Virginia.
The president indirectly hinted at the situation around his elected Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of Republicans coming to vote in midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five more weeks for the most important choices of our lives.
“It’s one of the most, most — I don’t run, but in fact I do run, so I run everywhere and fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And if you are determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see the convictions, the despicable.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that’s what they want is power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “resist and interfere.”
“And you see it over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and evil and despicable and dishonest.”
He mentioned, on her behalf, the minority leader of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which drew outrage from the crowd.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I waited until -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a pluralistic place.
She is intolerant to those who express their opinions.
When momentum activists in my local party branch voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
After all, I’m the last in a line of Labour MPs who were told they weren’t welcome—and just because we expressed our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the decision to censor me criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe — ironically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous party leaders.
The committee on the East Nottingham Liberal Party meeting on Friday said: “We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday evenings were just like that.
For now, this is not the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of a long-forgotten “gentleer, gentler” policy, if ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party has no tolerance for different views, and each opinion is judged to be acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy was elected head of the party, when colleagues who previously thought we shared a similar political view began to expect him to make a U-turn and take positions that I would never have agreed to – whether it was national security or a single European market.
Every time I speak in public — and it doesn’t really matter what I say — there is an abusive stream of rebuke on social media with calls for impeachment, condemnation of the center’s politics, and calls that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than many of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I am struck by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of racist abuse every day but never back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become routine.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are already in the same pluralistic place, and with every “distrust” decision or change in the rules of the election, the party becomes more troublesome.
Over the past two years, many have advised me to keep my mouth shut, not to be so loud and then I’ll be fine.
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, horrified by the Thatcher government’s neglect that nearly caused my public school class to fall apart, I’ve been looking for ways to fight for better social services for those who need them the most – whether as a local councillor or as a cabinet minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way be confused as to my political positions and issues of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who advanced the resolution on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country is crawling towards a Brexit that will hurt our families, businesses and public service, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But to be honest, the one message I have is not to the momentum movement in Nottingham, but to my electorate, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of impeachment threats or political utilitarianism will deter me from acting in a way that I believe best serves the interests of all of you.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Air to the Peak
“Two recent freshmen have slightly tilted the final score, but there is no doubt that Aire deserves a win in today’s exciting Scottish Premier League game.
They are now at the top of the chart, the only undefeated side of the teen.
In the end, it was their better defense, as well as much more risk taking, playing for the home team, and coach Peter Morchi had every reason to be happy.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far, and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of the Melrose group said: “Air deserves all the credit, they took better risks than us.”
Grant Anderson's Trey in the 14th minute, betted by Fraser Climo, put Aire in the lead position, but a yellow card for Scotland's Rory Hughes released to the game by the Warriors allowed Melrose to score points and Jason Baggott caught Trey who was not bet.
Climo raised Air's lead with offense, before he was halfway through, he scored and then converted Trey Solo to 17-5 for Air in half.
But Melrose opened the second half well and the new Patrick Engerson, who was converted by Goethe, narrowed the gap to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a severe injury by Roderick Knut, who was taken away on a stretcher, and beginning with the game's renewal, Aire widened the gap through Trey's Stafford McDowell, who was converted by Climo.
Airline captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of the other man with Bruce Colvin's unconverted Trey, ending a series of intense pressures.
But the home team recovered, and when Stroen Hutchinson received a yellow card for attacking Klimo without a bullet from the penalty line, McPherson scored a touchdown behind Air’s progressive mound.
Climo converted, as he did almost again from returning to the game, after Kyle Roy S. kicked David Armstrong's boxing and sent the winger a grain of Henry to the sixth Trey of the home team.
Star Still Game Looks Ready for a New Career in Restaurants
Still Game star, Ford Kernan, appears ready to move into the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he was listed as the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and where he stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hamfil.
The duo announced that the next season would be the final season of the show, and Kirnan appears to be planning a lifetime after Kryling.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source from the Scotch Sun suggested that Kiernan was looking for ways to enter the thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia that cannot find the sea hopes that the court will open a path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the Navy's headquarters in a blanket of ships in La Paz.
Public buildings are flying a blue-sea flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the slogan: “The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to sue him back.”
All over Bolivia that can’t find the sea, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century, is still alive—as is the yearning to sail again in the Pacific.
Those hopes may be at their peak for decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court decision on Oct. 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and serenity, and of course it expects a positive attitude toward the future,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will step up the International Court’s decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favor of Bolivia’s demand that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile be forced to negotiate sovereign access to the sea to Bolivia.
Bolivia’s charismatic native president, Evo Morales, who is facing a controversial re-election campaign next year, hinges heavily on Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But analysts believe there is little chance that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia – and that even if it decides in its favor, it won’t make much difference.
The U.N. court in The Hague has no authority to grant Chilean territory, and said it would not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling came only six weeks after hearing the concluding arguments suggests that the case was “not complicated,” but Faz Zarata, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of advancing Bolivia’s claims, the past four years may have weakened them.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current administration in Bolivia,” Zarata said.
Morales’ war rhetoric has wiped out any remnants of goodwill on the part of Chile, she said.
“Sometimes Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velez, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a “great opportunity to open a new era in relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disputes for the benefit of both sides,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, is using the maritime issue as a political lever.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says denuclearization won’t happen unless it can trust U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of reopening diplomatic negotiations on nuclear weapons that have reached a dead end more than three months after a summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a “dream of asapmia” to think that continued U.S. sanctions and resistance to declare an end to the Korean War would force North Korea to kneel.
The U.S. is afraid to agree to the declaration without North Korea first taking significant steps to denuclearize.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are interested in a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that North Korea is serious about giving up its nuclear arsenal, where it is likely to see the only way to protect its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
A fashion show in Paris unveils the new trend in giant hats found on its way to luxury stores everywhere
We’ll find the solution for anyone who wants to expand the hat collection or get complete sun protection.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a series of huge, crazy headgears to their SS19 collection at a fashion show that stunned the fashion scene at Paris Fashion Week.
Evidently impractical hats captured Instagram this summer, and these designers brought their extraordinary creations to the fashion show.
Valentino’s notable item was an oversized beige hat decorated with broad feather-like edges that covered the heads of the models.
Other demilitarized-sized accessories included decorated watermelons, a wizard's hat and even pineapples - but they are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of strange masks - check in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks included sewn lips and more of Hannibal Lecter's blood than Hot Cowter's.
One piece mentioned a diving mask including a snorkel and glasses, and another looked like a melting ice cream cup.
And those who want to continue with a huge fashion statement - their time has come.
Fashion commentators expect the giant hills to make their way to luxury stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after ‘La Bomba’, the half-meter-tall straw hat that has been spotted on everyone’s head, from Mariana to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that flooded social networks spawned another great piece on the runway – a sea key bag almost the size of the swimsuit model who carried it.
Burnt-coloured relaxation bag, with the fringe of loose strands and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacqueline La Riviera’s SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and big sea veterans to arrive in luxury stores next summer – because the design made a huge impression and it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edwards: Language Skills Essential to the World’s Citizens
Scotland’s independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with an additional set of outstanding test results, which is bolstered by personal and group success in sports, art, music and other areas of community practice.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for a career in which they will choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that is able to design and implement a customized curriculum, we find that modern languages continue to gain popularity as a sought-after field of study in school.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
If you talk to a man in his own language, it goes into his heart.”
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the last tests this year, you can see that languages are at the top of tables with the highest success rate in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a high A in Mandarin, as did 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and teens will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today the field of languages as a subject of choice is considered at the same level as STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Council on Employment and Skills found that among the reasons employers cited Cody for vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, increasingly, language skills become an essential necessity to prepare students for future careers.
In view of the rising demands for languages for future job opportunities, these skills are essential in a world of globalization.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have a significant advantage in the future thanks to this lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically stabilizes a person in an advantageous position over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language at a level sufficient for a conversation, and French was the only language with a bilingual 15 percent of speakers.
This is why it is important to invest in teaching children languages.
Knowledge of many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different as to the languages taught there.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered most important to Britain looking forward to the 20th century, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever the child’s interest is, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools, with a team of teachers specializing in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed in any foreseeable future.
It cannot be denied today, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this fact should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and excellence to the children of Scotland.
That's the time order.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools.
LeBron is set to play for the Lakers for the first time on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is over for fans who have been waiting to see LeBron James play for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening preseason game against the Denver Ngatts on Sunday in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” the official website of the Lakers said.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six preseason games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump's rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump opens with a flurry of election rallies tonight in Willing, Virginia.
It is the first of five planned Trump rallies this week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While voting to approve his appointment to the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can we watch it online?
The Trump rally in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 19:00 East Coast time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to this week’s hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense around accusations of sexual misconduct and the subsequent postponement of the Senate vote a week as the FBI investigates the charges.
But the main goal of this rallies is to help Republicans facing a challenging election in November gain some momentum.
President Trump’s campaign said the aim of these five rallies next week was to “energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is so critical to his agenda that the president is ready to visit as many countries as possible as the busy election season begins,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters.
This evening’s rally, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbanko Stadium in Willing, could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and pull press coverage from the press in Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the country where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is behind the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come to try to improve his situation in the polls,” said Simon Hyder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Willingness to Fight to Keep Hope For Sunday Singles
After three one-sided sessions, Sunday afternoon qualifiers may be exactly what the Ryder Cup needs.
The momentum-driven pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but the players really believe in it, and never more than in competitions like this one.
So where do they think we'll find the momentum now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so you can see that as a bit of momentum,” Jorn Septi said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, four points ahead with 12 more in the game.
But the Americans, as Sepith says, feel like they have a little wind in the sails, and they have a lot to cheer up, not the last of them in Sepith’s shape, and Justin and Thomas who have been playing together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Sepith’ was deadly from the Hattie to the Green and is a leader in personal example.
The cries of joy grew stronger as his round continued, as he drowned a critical Pat to win the four-all-square game and Thomas dropped two after two.
His Pat who won the 15on game won a similar cry, the kind that shows he believes the American team still has hope.
“You really just have to dig deep and worry about your own game,” Sepith said.
That's all that's left for each of these players to do.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Sophie and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup’s undisputed lead story.
The strange, but charming, duo of Europe is four out of four and they are all well-liked.
Mollywood was the only pair not to hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back at 9:00 on Friday morning.
The same round, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic audience, underpins the fact that they are the players to win on Sunday, and there won’t be a more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to sign the potential European victory as the sun sets on the Le Golf National.
Better both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European fame.
Doll and Tasson Webb Simpson finished with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four balls, when he was robbed with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles in the front nine brought the Spaniards and Swedes down to a hole they didn't come close to coming out of.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you out of the pit.
It’s fascinating to look closely at the four balls and quartets because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and the way a strategy can change in a blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is significantly ahead of the final day, but this four-day session has shown that the U.S. team is full of fighting that some, especially within the U.S., have cast doubt on.
Europe leads 10-6 for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a healthy lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing the four-ball and four-square games on Saturday with a 10-6 draw against the US.
The inspiring duo Tommy Fleetwood and Vernesco Molinari led the change with two victories over struggling Tiger Woods, raising the gap in Le Golf National to four points.
European side players Thomas Bjorn, who tried to defend the trophy they lost two years ago, dominated against the Americans who missed the four-ball game this morning, bringing the series to 3-1.
The American players showed more resistance in the qualifiers, and won two games, but were unable to close the gap.
To keep the trophy, Jim Forrick’s friends need eight points out of the only 12 games.
Fleetwood is the first European to win four points in a row, while he and Molynery, who have earned the nickname "Mollywood" after an extraordinary weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their four Ryder Cup opening games.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball games, they went on in miraculous harmony together to defeat the weakened Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambaugh with an even more pronounced score of 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself across two games on Saturday, showed random bursts of excellence, but so far he has lost 19 of the 29 games of the four balls and fours, and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning’s four-ball games, returned to join Henrik Stanson in the quarter-finals to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopka – ranked first and third in the world.
However, not everything went smoothly for European players in the pleasant weather and the breeze that blew southwest of Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Sepith and Justin Thomas set the bar for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a 2nd and 1st victory over John Ram from Spain and Ian Folter in the four-ball games and later returned to defeat Fletter and Rory McLivey 4th and 3rd in the quarterfinals, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup team returned from a negative four-point gap to the singles games, though as the Cup holders, Forrick's men only need a draw to keep holding the Cup.
However, after two days in second place, Sunday’s counterattack seems to be beyond their reach.
North Korea says it will ‘under no circumstances’ disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday at the United Nations that continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that there was no chance the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
At the annual U.N. General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho announced that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill steps” in the past year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and a commitment not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology anymore.
“But we don’t see any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure about our national defense and under such conditions we will in no way unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Cheri echoed North Korea’s well-known complaints about U.S. opposition to a “graded” approach to denuclearization, saying that North Korea would be rewarded while taking gradual steps, his statement seemed important in that it did not reject nuclear denuclearization as North Korea had done in the past.
Ree referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, at which Kim pledged to work toward “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised to protect North Korea’s security.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also opposed calls to reduce international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases sanctions pressure to achieve its goal through coercion, and even opposes ‘an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can make us kneel is a dream in the assemblage of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the escalating sanctions are deepening our distrust.”
Ri made no mention of the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president emphasized in a U.N. speech earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: “If the other side of the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a dead end.”
However, Ri's tone was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that a U.S. missile attack on North Korea was inevitable after Mr. Trump called Kim a "rocket man" who was on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened North Korea’s “total destruction,” praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a set time frame for that, adding that “if it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia have argued that the U.N. Security Council should reward North Korea for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue with determination and unhindered until we achieve complete and verifiable final nuclear disarmament.”
The UN Security Council has unanimously backed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for its ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for placing “gangster demands.”
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear facility if the United States takes “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim told him that the “corresponding measures” he wanted included security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as changes in the direction of normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year teaches participants how to sleep more, trying to combat the expanding macho culture of learning by staying up all night with caffeine.
Academic research has found that students at the number one university in the world often have no idea when it comes to the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Cassisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham <0x26> Vimans Hospital, designed the course, which he estimates is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to open the course after a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the lecture, one girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are they telling me this just now, in my senior year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told the Telegraph.
The course, delivered for the first time this year, explains to students the principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall condition.
Paul Breira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a senior director of health care at the university, said the university decided to open the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section appears a picture of a dorm room, where students press coffee cups, curtains, sports clothes and books - to get explanations about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of a sleepwalking routine.
In another section, participants are told how persistent sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, if interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students overnight.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes.”
He said the culture of pride in ‘sleepless night success’ still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students are causing the problem of sleep shortages to grow.
Taking care of adequate sleep, and good sleep quality, should be the ‘secret weapon’ of every student to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of hunger, so we’re hungry all the time.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler design the course after attending one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course enlightened him and motivated him to encourage a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar teaching program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chaisel recommended that students examine the possibility of setting a clock that would ring when it was time to go to sleep, and not just when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue light’ emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which could disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's decisive goal for Gerard's players
The Rangers suffered another attack of loss in a away game when Dolly Manga caused Stephen Gerard's rebel players to lose 1–0 at Livingston.
Ibrox players hoped to win their first away game win since the February 1-4 win at St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerard's second loss in 18 games as manager, leaving the team eight points behind the Scottish Premier League's rushing Harts.
Manga attacked seven minutes before the half and it didn’t seem like the uninspired Rangers would match.
As the Rangers now plummet to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place, just behind Hibernian by a goal.
And it may be that Rangers Double is waiting for another after the Cowboy Colum Spence needed treatment for a head injury after an artifact was probably thrown at him from the stand.
Gerard made eight exchanges for the team that passed Air to the semi-finals of the Cup in Tepard.
Holt, on the other hand, came up with the same 11 Livingston players who took a point from the Harts last week, and he could have been satisfied with how his players had stopped his opponents in any situation.
The Rangers may have controlled possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They almost conquered in the second minute when Manga sent a ball to Scott Patman who kicked to the goal of Alan McGregor, but a midfielder kicked the ball too far.
Then a deep free kick by Keegan Jacob found Captain Craig Elect, but his defender Alan LaGoy could only kick out of the beam.
The Rangers did take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have ruled guilty after a quarter-hour game, when he and Steven Lewis clashed, but Judge Steven Thomson waved against the Colombian player's pleas.
The Rangers only managed to score twice in the first half, but Ibrokes goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily braked off Lasana Colibali and Obi-Ajaria’s weak kick.
While Livingston’s opening in the 34th minute was contrary to the way the game was played, no one would deny that they deserved it at least for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs’s deep free-ball.
Scott Artfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool with the manga for a simple finish.
G<0xC3><0xA9>rard did a half-time job replacing Colibelli with Ryan Kent, and the switch had an immediate impact almost when the extreme/wing shot into Morlos but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to force the guest team to play exactly the type of game they liked, with Lithgoy and the picker still sending long balls.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the other stages, but McGregor was well-positioned to avoid Jacobs's attempt before Litagy was knocked out of the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton later had another claim against Jacobs, but Thomson ignored it again.
Elmanak: Inventor of Geiger counter
And now stand from the Germanic of Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and continue ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geir developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the device has become a pillar of science, but in 1950 it has also become a pillar of pop culture thanks to the film Bells of Coronado, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as two bizarre cowboys/scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that thing?"
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put the headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of radioactivity on atoms in minerals.”
Evans: “Oh, man, it’s really blowing right now!”
Hans Geiger passed away in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live after him.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and eliminate them
Vaccination Teaches Immune System to Identify Cancer Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, and changing the cells in the laboratory
Then the cells can "see" a protein that's shared with many cancers and then they're injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
In one woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to detect cancer cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berezofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Batsada, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “Prevents the development of a number of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, vision and colon cancers, explained Prof. Bersofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to attack cancer cells has been successful in treating a type of blood cancer.
Kanye West broke into a rebuke speech supporting Trump, with his MAGA hat on his head, after his appearance on SNL.
It was not well received.
Kanye West responded with disdain at the studio during a confused appearance on the Saturday Night Live show, praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song on the show, called "Ghost Town," during which he wore a make-America Great hat, he broke into a reprimand speech against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
So many times I talk to white people who say, "How can you love Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The episode of SNL began with a sketch starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blazy Ford.
Although the reprimand speech was not aired on the show, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to roll on West in the piece's publicity.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had been criticized behind the scenes for the hat he was wearing.
They attacked me behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out to the stage with that hat on your head.”
They attacked me!
Then they said I was in a dark place,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, “Do you want to see the dark place?” Saying that he’s wearing my Superman hat, because that means no one can tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try to show love.”
His comments were booed at least twice by the audience, and it appeared that SNL staff members were embarrassed, Variety reported, and one of them told the newspaper: "A deep silence has fallen in the entire studio."
West was added to the show as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-partner, Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
I love it when I wear it as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for not giving in to the crowd.”
But current TV presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West simply "be who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
“But I have chosen not to reward (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) that I believe exerts and spreads an ideology that is detrimental to my community.
He's free.
“And so are we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that from now on he was “the entity that was once known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Didi, Papi and P Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Doc, had the name Snoop Lyon, and of course the famous musician Prince changed his name to a symbol and later to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder for stabbing at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

The suspect is expected to appear in Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Rinton is best known for his role as John Snow, the sword-swinger of the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old attacked the macho hero’s stereotype, saying that such roles on screen often convey to young children the message that they must be tough to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married another star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he was “very upset” about handling the issue.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Personally, I feel very upset right now — where did we go wrong about masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach men in their growth period, from the point of view of the problem we are witnessing right now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity, due to the very masculine characters she presents.
He continued: “What comes from within and what can we learn from outside?
What do we learn from television, and on the street, that makes young kids feel like they have to be on this particular side of being a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how do you change that?
There is no doubt that something has gone wrong for young people.”
In an interview, he admitted that he would not participate in any sequel or derivative series of Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer, saying that he was "finished with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Keith will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's 'True West', which tells the story of a film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently discovered that he sees meeting his wife Rose as the best thing that has ever happened as a result of Game of Thrones.
“I knew my wife in the series, so this way the series gave me my future family, and my life from that moment on,” he said.
Rose played the role of Yeagritt, John Snow's love interest, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The two married in June 2018 in the yard of the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have the disease, according to health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been infected as a result of having sex, which is a change from the past.
To date, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has shrunk to almost zero, according to health officials in China at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection as a result of having sex is a burning problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality ceased to be against the law in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of infection are the result of the lack of adequate protective measures in these sexual relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has secured universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her team leaked information about a Republican senator and condemns the “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed the allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three U.S. senators on the U.S. senators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democratic senator estimated that the allegations were being circulated by websites and “extreme right-wing” critics.
“Lies, lies, and more despicable lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
According to reports, the information released included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orin Hutch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, and was published by an unknown man on Capitol Hill during a hearing before the Senate Committee on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was linked to Waters' office and published the information about a Waters team member, according to a Hill report.
“This baseless accusation is completely false and a total lie,” Waters added.
“A member of my team — whose identity and personal information have been disclosed and whose security has been compromised as a result of these false and false accusations — was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a total lie.”
Waters' announcement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>This indicates that it does not have the temperament required of members of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t react with anger.
He can't react defiantly.
He should not question the defendant's motives.
He must be calm and peaceful.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’s reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of seeming too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to beat Waters in the midterm election, also tweeted his thoughts.
“It’s great if that’s the truth,” he wrote on Twitter.
In her announcement, Waters said her office had addressed “the appropriate authorities and law enforcement about these false allegations.
“We will make sure that the criminals are discovered,” she continued, “and that they will be prosecuted for all their destructive and dangerous acts against my team members.”
Johnny English 3.0 – A Weakened Spy Parody starring Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to look for meanings about Brexit in every new film with a British perspective, and it does seem appropriate for this revival of the action-comedy parody of the Johnny English series – which began somewhere in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English coming back.
Will an ironic self-slap about how worthless we are become our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, Johnnie English, with his open eyes and a rubbery face, had another chance to mess things up – and his name more than anything, symbolizes a wide-ranging comedy created for moviegoers in non-English speaking countries.
He is, of course, the dumb English agent, who, despite his strange pretence of a smooth glow, looks a bit like Clouseau, a little Mr. Bean and plenty from this guy who donates a single character to the tone of the chariot fire in the opening text of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also based on the mysterious international traveler played by Atkinson in the forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard, which leaves chaos behind.
There's a nice one or two minutes in the last edition of Johnny English.
I liked the part where Johnny English approached the helicopter in a medieval armored suit, and the propeller blades rang for moments on his helmet.
Atkinson demonstrates his comedic physical abilities, but humor feels rather weakened and unnecessary in a strange way, especially because the “serious” type of spy movies like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now include a comedy component.
The humour feels like it’s directed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English’s insanely failed adventures are less brilliant and focused than atkinson’s silent film-style jokes as Mr. Bean.
The film begins when a great danger threatens Britain.
A hacker infiltrated the British spy's super-secret Internet network, revealing the identities of all of Britain's agents on the ground, to the fear of the chief agent - a small role unfortunately for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for an arrogant, battle-prepared prime minister who is already suffering from a total collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best to play the role like Theresa May, but has little to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is exposed, she will have to bring someone back from retirement.
And that means the braggart Johnny English herself, who is now employed as a school principal in a prestigious institution, but gives unofficial lessons on how to be an undercover spy: some good jokes here, when English offers a rock school-style espionage academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former aide to Suffering Studies Boff, who is again portrayed by Ben Miller.
Boff is now a man married to submarine headquarters, in the role of an annoying class queen on whom Viko Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin's introduction of Her Majesty's Secret Service into a terrible mess are back in place, confronted by a beautiful Pam-Fatal in the form of Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously trapped under the fascination of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems – the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin with their odyssey which is more of a farce of two clowns: under the guise of waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves out on Volta’s magnificent yacht; and English sets off a complete anarchy in his attempt to use a virtual reality set and learn to get to know the interior structure of a house.
There is no doubt that all efforts are made to lead to the final sequence, but despite the kindness and playfulness, it has a sense of television for children.
Pretty mediocre.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour denies it is preparing a plan for the British to work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan for the British to work four days a week but get paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants company executives to pass on the savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees in the form of another day of rest.
I mean, the employees will have a three-day weekend, and they'll still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea was “fit for the company’s economic agenda” and its plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The Trade Union Congress supports the transition to a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “Policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration that fits the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea, with the Green Party calling for a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the ambition is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it.”
Labour’s candidate for Finance, John McDonnell, took advantage of the party’s conference last week to shape his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless managers” and “pricebreakers” in service companies.
It also follows that current shareholders of water companies may not get their full investment back because the Labor government may make “reductions” on the basis of misconduct.
It also confirms that there are plans to bring employees to the boards of companies and create ‘owner-inclusive funds’ to transfer 10 percent of the capital of companies in the private sector to employees, who will pocket annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy told TV show 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh changes their minds
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings could persuade Republicans to withdraw his support.
In an idea aired on 60 Minutes on Sunday, reporter Scott Pelli asked Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” said Kennedy.
“I said ahead of the hearing, I said I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when the accusation came up, and I said, ‘Did you do it?’
He was determined, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham's vote, on the other hand, appears to be carved into a rock.
“I’ve already made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and there will be a need for an explosive accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blazy Ford.
“And no man she mentioned could verify that.
It's 36 years old.
I can’t see how anything can change.”
What is the World Citizens’ Festival and did it contribute to reducing poverty?
New York Saturday will date the World Citizens Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive list of stars to appear and an equally impressive goal of ending world poverty.
The seventh World Citizens Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to a large lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy shows like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event – to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens’ Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert island must complete a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness for the purpose of ending poverty.
But how much success has the festival really achieved, with only 12 years to go before it achieves its goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert ticket really a way to convince them to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of “clickivism” – people who feel like they’re really making an impact by signing a petition on the Internet or tweeting?
Since 2011, the World Citizens Organization says it has documented more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters, pushing for a variety of different goals.
He said these actions helped spur world leaders to declare commitments and policies worth more than <0x24>37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements as a result of its operations, at least <0x24>10 billion of which had already begun distributing or raising funds.
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and practitioners committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” promising to provide Rwanda with <0x24>35 million to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the World’s Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and ‘world citizens’ like you, we can turn social justice on malnutrition into a footnote in history,” Ambassador Tracy Allman told the audience during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced a stipend for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
“Citizens of the world” she replied: “It will be a long and difficult path – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights movements before us and the opposition to apartheid, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monet are among some of the shows to be presented at this year’s event in New York by Deborah-Lee Fornes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval blockade to delay Russian energy exports
“If necessary,” Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, revealed U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Jump, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russian involvement in Syria – which is being done, it is important to mention, at the invitation of the legitimate government – would be an excuse to spread to new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States is able, with our fleet, to make sure that the sea routes are open and, when necessary, to impose a blockade to make sure that their energy sources are not reaching the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that defines itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are indeed the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less leverage and replacement of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony” because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration embarks on a mission to boost its dense natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russian energy sources, which are a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to cancel its participation in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin a Moscow “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is supposed to double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion square meters, is an economic project only.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s firm opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons and serves as an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The U.S. position was strongly opposed by Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industry Association (BDI), the leading organization in the German industrial sector, has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Association (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to “seriously consider” running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “seriously consider” running for president after a midterm election.
Warren confirmed her intention to run for president during a meeting at Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken administration, and to do that, it’s necessary for a woman to take the lead,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider the presidential race.”
Warren voiced her opinion of President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren harshly criticized Trump for appointing Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters don’t think she should run for the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “potential” voters said the senator should not run for office, according to a survey by Suffolk University’s Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the intention to run for the senator's presidency.
The poll showed that there was more support for former governor D<0xC3><0xA9>val Patrick's run, with 38 percent supporting his run against 48 percent opposing it.
High-profile figures from the Democratic Party that emerged in connection with a possible 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, according to AP reports.
Sarah Palin notes Trac Palin’s post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump rally
26-year-old Trac Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son has been going through, what he’s been going through since he returned, allows me to identify with families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back from,” she told a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of her son and other veterans, “they come back a little different, they come back stiff, they come back and they wonder if what they gave the country to their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the other soldiers, is honored.”
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Vosila, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vosila police.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing situations involving gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filled out a “court friend” deposition on Friday in Washington to support the challenge to asylum seekers’ policies, NBC reported.
The complainant’s full name in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Rights Association in August has not been disclosed.
She said her violent partner and his “guys, gang members” abused her, but U.S. government officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's state attorneys described the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum applications are filed in the United States, as nations dealing with many problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the BIA Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented migrants fleeing situations of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Carl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international laws.”
“Federal law requires that all hearings on asylum applications rely on the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and the new policy barrier violates this principle,” the affidavit read.
The lawyers also argued in the affidavit that the policy, which prevents the entry of immigrants, hurts the U.S. economy because they tend to become entrepreneurs and “provide necessary work,” they said.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing family abuse and gang violence in June.
“The asylum is open to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear on grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 statement.
The purpose of the asylum was never to alleviate all the problems -- even not all the serious ones -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palo, as the death toll doubles, in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more difficult by the minute.
“There’s a very tense feeling,” said 35-year-old Risa Kosuma, a mother to the baby who is feverish at the evacuation center in Palo, the devastated city.
“At any moment, the ambulance brings the bodies.
“Clean water is rare.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, interspersed with water-soaked objects, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Devi Harris, who suffered back and shoulder fractures, lay outside Palo's military hospital, where they were treated for severe aftershocks that continued after the earthquake.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how he felt the violent earthquake rocking the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the wreckage of the wall, I think,” Harris told AP, adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they’re in a safe place.”
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the American daily, aggressively promoting the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid add-on by the Chinese newspaper China Daily in The Moyne Registrar, the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to meddle in the November 6 U.S. congressional election, claiming China rejected it.
Trump’s accusation that China tried to meddle in the U.S. election marked a new stage, according to U.S. officials, in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now stuck in a growing trade war in which each country raises and compares tariffs on imported goods from its rival.
The tariffs, which China raised as a reprisal in the early stages of the trade war, were intended to hurt exporters from countries like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, U.S. and Chinese experts said.
Terry Bernstead, the U.S. ambassador to China, a former governor of Iowa for many years and an important exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Bernstead wrote in an op-ed in the Sunday edition of The Moyne Registrar, “strengthens bullying by advertising in our free press.”
“In disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America’s cherished freedom of speech and press tradition, and is posting a paid ad in Des Moines Registrar,” Bernstead wrote.
“On the other hand, at the newsstand on the streets of Beijing, you will find few opposition votes and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about the worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers evaded the offer to publish” his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Republican Party bans women's votes ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh incident, analysts warn
While many Republican leaders stand by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and condemn him for a number of sexual assault charges, analysts have warned they will see a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments surrounding the issue were particularly vivid, and most Republicans are officially demonstrating their desire to move forward in the voting process.
“You can’t go back on this kind of stuff,” Grant Rieher, a political science professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Rieher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute efforts to open an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday — they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the MoveOn Progressive Movement, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted “November is coming”! When they protested in the Senate hallway, as the Republicans in control of the Senate Judiciary Committee chose to continue promoting Kavanaugh’s appointment, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, according to a report by Mic.
“The levels of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break new records,” said Stu Rottenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say they’ve been tall; they’re right.
But they can be higher, especially among swarming voices of women in the suburbs and among young voters aged 18-29 who, despite their dissatisfaction with the president, often abstain from voting.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which detailed her allegations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court candidate, analysts said there could be a backlash if Republicans continue to push for confirmation.
“The appointment has caused a serious complication for Republicans,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just the committee’s vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will accept the nomination, but also how the Republicans handled it and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, the director of USA Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided on their belief in the testimony of Ford and Quano, with slightly higher support for Ford.
A recent YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believed in either the certainty or the probability of Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in the certainty or probability of the quano.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was definitely or probably lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s allegations as well as allegations raised by at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh attacked her drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate revealed his gender to her during a party they attended at Yale University in the 1980s.
Inventor of World Wide Web Plans to Start a New Internet Network to Beat Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global Internet, is launching a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the man who has become a legend in the tech world, is a company that will develop Solid, Berners-Lee’s open source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be allowed access to the different types of data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was “global domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create a personal online database or POD.
The database can include a contact list, lists of actions to perform, a schedule, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify will all be available in one browser at the same time.
What makes the personal online database unique is that only the user can decide who can access the information and what type of information can be accessed.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to John Bruce, the company’s CEO, Inrupt will find the right resources, process, and capabilities to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Today the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a team of several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world will be able to create distributed applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not discussing with Facebook or Google about their agreement or refusal to introduce a complete change that would cause a complete and overnight reversal in all of their business models.
“We’re not asking them for permission.”
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission “is to provide commercial energy and an environmental system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the face of the Internet when he founded the W3C Organization at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Also during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the founder and director of the W3C, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m particularly optimistic about the next era of the network,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: An Event to Commemorate the Clergyman Who Won the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman from the Church of England to have won the Victorian Cross during World War I was noted at an event in his hometown, 100 years after the victory.
Lieutenant-Colonel and Reverend Bernard Van, won the Victoria Cross on September 29, 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never found to have won the highest British honors.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rashden, North Hampton County, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that exposing the stone exactly 100 after his grandfather won the honor is “extraordinaryly symbolic.”
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Van led his regiment and crossed the San Canton Canal “through heavy fog and under heavy fire from field cannons and machine gun subs.”
He then rushed to the line of fire and led the line forward before rushing to take over a machine gun with one hand and dropping three of the company.
Lieutenant-Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never compare to but something that makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Royal Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said he was “very honored to be part of the parade” and added, “The heroism of a true hero is demonstrated in the support that will be given to many people.”
Fans of the mixed martial arts stayed up all night watching Blateur 206, and instead got Pepe Pig.
Imagine staying up all night watching the action of Baltor 206 and eventually being denied the main event.
The San Jose show consisted of 13 fights, including six on the main ticket, and was shown live during the night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Jagard Musassi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the battle, viewers in Britain remained stunned as the coverage changed to Pepe Pig.
Some of them were not impressed by the change after staying up until very early in the morning to watch the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the transition to the children’s cartoon as “a kind of sick joke.”
“This is a government regulation that says at 6 a.m. the original content was inappropriate and so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Balator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pep Pig, yeah."
Scott Cocker, the president of the company, said they plan to work on their schedules to include future British spectators.
“I think when I think about the rerun, I think we can obviously solve it,” Cocker said.
“But it’s six o’clock on Sunday morning there and we won’t be able to solve the problem until Sunday in our time zone, that is, on Monday in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, during the transition, many text messages were exchanged between the parties and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical malfunction.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you that next time this is not going to happen.
“We only had five fights instead of six – as we usually do – we tried to give the fans more and we just exaggerated.
It’s a matter of misfortune.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Slow' Because of His Sexual Orientation
Tom Daley, the Olympic water jumper, said that as he was growing up, he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation — but that feeling motivated him to become a success.
The 24-year-old jumper said he didn’t know until he reached middle school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, directed by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke on gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The old show’s regular host, Christy Young, went on a sick leave of several months.
In his appearance as the star of Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "underestimated" by the others as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “Until today, the feeling of inferiority and the feeling of differentiation were real things that gave me strength and strength and allowed me to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually discovered his sexual orientation.
The man, who has won twice the Olympic bronze medal, became a high-profile leader of the LGBT community and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on other countries to legalize homosexuality.
He spoke openly about it because he felt fortunate to have been given the opportunity to live openly and without consequences and wanted to give others “hope.”
The triple-winner said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “has caught me by surprise.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years his senior, last year but said the age gap was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he was in the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone his age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Day, and Daley said his "every point of view" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about ‘I should win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Ruby.”
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said his father didn’t accept the fact that he was about to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him you wouldn’t be here to be in the front row, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand while his breath stopped and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not invincible,” he said.
A year later, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that it was something I’ve been dreaming about all my life — diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics didn’t feel any better,” he said.
That’s also what inspired him to pick his first song — Heather Small’s Proud — that he identified with during preparations for the Olympic Games and that still makes him duck skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15, according to British Summer Time.
Mikaelson disappointed in performance and went down to the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
U.S. golfer Phil Mikaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to upgrade the performance so that the event does not become an unhappy milestone.
Mikaelson, who attends the 12th biannual event and sets a record, dropped to the bench at Jim Furick’s decision during the Foursomes and Four Bowls on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as they have been playing for the U.S. national team, Michaelson, who has won the Major Tournament five times, spent half of the day as a cheerleader and the other half working on his game on the fringes in hopes of correcting the ill he suffered.
Even at the height of his career, the actor’s performance suffered from downs and ups. Therefore, the 48-year-old Mikaelson is not the ideal choice for La Golf National, where the long lawn lanes are usually not forgiving for squabbling.
And if the competition itself isn’t deterrent enough, Mikaelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, competed against the exact British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with starting player Tommy Fleetwood and won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who lost four points at the start of the 12 games, were to succeed in the early stages, Mikaelson's game could have been decisive.
Pioric expressed confidence in his player, although we did not expect him to say anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, put his arm around me and said he’d be ready tomorrow,” said Feurik.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He was a member of the Hall of Fame and added a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's how it got going and we thought we should keep going.
He wanted to be on the track, just like all the other players.”
Mikaelson will break Nick Paldo’s record with the highest number of games in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
That could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never really matched his personal peaks.
Mikaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, though Fj<0xC3><0xB8>rk said his presence added some intangible benefits to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and it’s fun to be in the dressing room with him,” he said.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed having fun with him this week, and it was nice to see that.
There’s more to it than the game itself.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big advantage could disappear soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the last day of the Ryder Cup singles could change for the worse.
The Danish player started playing in the Valderama in 1997, when his playmate, Grandfather Ballastros, had a 5-point lead over the Americans, which he lost almost when he crossed the finish line with a minor lead and won 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I keep reminding myself that we had a big lead in Valderama; we had a big lead in the game in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderama, where we won but with a small lead,” Bjorn said, in the photo, after watching the 5–3 victory at the 2018 tournament on both Friday and yesterday, which led to a 10–6 lead at La Golf National.
“So history will prove to me and everyone on the team that it’s not over.
We have to give it all tomorrow.
You have to get on track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, to try to win the trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I’ve said all along, I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re very aware of those on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn was happy with the performance of his players on the difficult golf course and added: “It’s important for me never to get ahead of the curve when it comes to golf.
Tomorrow can be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, and it's completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on the track when everything goes well, but when you're there alone, then your full ability as a golfer stands the test.
And that’s the message to be delivered to the players: you have to make the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he needs to make the best of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, rival team captain Jim Furick would expect better personal performances from his players compared to their performances in the pair games, except for Jordan Sepith and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Fioric himself knows both the winning side and the losing side during the important final days of such tournaments, having participated in the winning team in Brooklyn before losing, with the European team miraculously winning in the final, as recorded in the movie "Miracle at Medinah".
“I remember every word,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players for the final day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to succeed in the early stages, as you saw in Brooklyn, and as you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum passes to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
“We prepare our squad accordingly and put the boys on track according to the feeling we have, you know, we’re trying to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the fight and he will face Rory McElroy in the summit match, with Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Falter, who are the rest of the Europeans in the top half.
“I chose the team in this order because I think he’s going to get us to the end,” Bjorn said.
The acceptance of Germany's new warship was once again denied.
Germany's new naval frigate was due to be accepted in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but was postponed for at least a year due to faulty systems and reduced costs, local media reported.
The acceptance of Rheinland-Pfalz, the leading ship in the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate line, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to join the navy in 2014, but worrying issues after the supply shut the envelope on the ambitious project.
All four of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class cruises, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the Bremen-class ageing frigates.
They are expected to include a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile batteries as well as stealth technologies, such as reduced acoustic, infrared and radar signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the newest frigates can be deployed for up to two years away from home ports.
However, repeated delays mean that the innovative ships – which are supposed to allow Germany to send troops overseas – will become obsolete by the time they enter service.
The lucky frigate F125 made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss dock in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to build ships after its delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of critical “software and hardware flaws” that made the warship useless for a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fleet would be operated by about 120 sailors—about half of the crew serving in the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, the ship has been found to have a dramatic weight gain that reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The ship Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, and is twice as heavy as the ships of the same type used by the Germans in World War II.
Aside from the malfunctioning software, the price tag of the entire project – which also includes team training – also becomes a problem.
It is rumored to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros (<0x24>3.6 billion) - beyond the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that fascinate the newest frigates are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s security committee, confirmed that today the navy “was running out of ships capable of deploying.”
The official source said the problem gained momentum and increased over time, as old ships were decommissioned but not replaced by other vessels.
He expressed his regret that it was not possible to join the Navy with a Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate.
Scotland's National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
A new study conducted at a mansion in the Scottish Mountains aims to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt their food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The research conducted by scientists at the National Foundation of Scotland will follow common bats and European telephones, as well as long-eared dubnton bats at Invereaux Gardens in Worcester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to keep track of bat activities throughout the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) team and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
A specialized sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequencies of the bat's readings and which of the species is responsible for them.
Next, the map of the living areas will be sketched to create a detailed picture in order of the size of the landscape, of their patterns of behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the National Trust of Scotland (NTS) hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of the management work of the living areas, such as the creation of meadows and how to best maintain the forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are under threat from development and construction work, which affects nesting and the loss of living areas.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, and the same is true for fly traps and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, bat ears are more useful when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo locating techniques to detect insects and identify obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS Foundation, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 760,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
She has 10 skilled experts, who regularly conduct surveys, nesting tests and sometimes even rescue.
The organization also established the first and only reserve dedicated to bats at the Tribe Manor in Dumfries and Galway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Manor manager David Thompson said the mansion was the ideal territory for them.
“Here in Thrive we have a great area for bats,” he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right living areas.
But many things are still unknown about bats, so the work we do here and in other assets will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of testing for bats before carrying out maintenance work inside the properties, as the unintended destruction of a single inhabited nest could destroy up to 400 females and puppies, and possibly an entire local population.
Bats are protected species and killing, harassing and disturbing bats or destroying their nesting areas are prohibited by law.
Elizabeth Pearl, a Scottish clerk at the Bat Conservation Foundation, encouraged the public to give a shoulder and help.
She said: “We have a lot to learn about our bats and about many of our species we just don’t know how their populations are.”
Ronaldo drops rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charges “fake news” and said people “want to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese striker Viuventus was charged with the rape of an American woman named Catherine Muiraga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her <0x24>375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Mr. Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, turned to his 142 million followers on Instagram in a live video a few hours after the allegations were made public, and called with disdain for the reports.
<0xE2><0x99><0xAA> No, no, no, no, no.
“What they said yesterday, Pike News,” the actor who won the Ballon d’Or five times told the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy person and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they have referred to as “unacceptable reporting of privacy suspicions,” Reuters reported.
Lawyer Christian Schritz said the actor would seek compensation for “moral damages in the amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel Suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting him at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga reportedly returned to the actor's room and the actor allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Muirage claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her he was a “good guy” at “99 percent” who had failed at “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that they were consensual.
Muirga also claims she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “feared of reprisals” and feared “to be publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old says she is now interested in canceling the arrangement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and passed the summer to Italian club Juventus in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will ‘forever regret’ loss of car manufacturers
Britain will ‘forever regret’ if it loses its position as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, said UK Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota’s interview with the BBC, in which it said that if the UK left the European Union without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Branston, near Derby, was “worrying.”
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
Japan’s automaker said the impact of border delays in a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Branston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Oris and Aventis models, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90 percent will be exported to the rest of the EU.
“In my view, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will see the production stoppage at our factory,” said Marvin Cook, chief executive of Toyota at Branston.
Other UK automakers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and how it will affect cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, and the Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automakers call supply chain risks in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a “precisely-timed” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes, from British suppliers and the rest of the EU, to produce cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border, and sector officials say they could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota will not be able to hold more than a day’s worth of inventory at the factory in Derbyshire, the company says, so production will be stopped.
Clarke said Theresa May’s Chequer’s plan, which details Britain’s future relationship with the EU, was “precisely calibrated to prevent these border checks.”
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best deal possible, as I said, not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of the opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4 Today.
“The evidence from Toyota and other car manufacturers is that the possibility of continuing to use the successful supply chain system we have at our disposal to this day is absolutely essential.”
Toyota did not say how long production would last, but in the longer term, it warned that the extra costs would hurt the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to layoffs.
Peter Tsubalaris, who has worked at Branston for 24 years and serves as president of the Unite union at the factory, said the union members were increasingly concerned: “In my experience, if the jobs were to be reduced, they would never be returned.
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, which many depend on, could be “postponed another week” as the fight for U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia and possible obstruction of investigation by the president.
For months, the gossip in Washington has been about whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of carrying a wiretap to record conversations with Trump and cause the president’s impeachment through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he arrived at the White House and was reportedly about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with Trump, who was at the time of Rosenstein’s arrival at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but at this point the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week into the allegations against Kavanaugh, and again rejected the Senate vote.
Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “We have not yet set a date for the meeting, it could take place this week, I can see another week’s postponement given what’s happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'm always happy to update the press."
Some reporters will dispute this assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the frequency of the briefings was not due to an aversion to the TV reporters’ “positioning,” although she said: “I will not deny the fact that they are taking a position.”
She then offered to increase the direct connection between Trump and the press.
“The president has more Q<0x26>A meetings than any president before him,” she said, adding without citing evidence: “We have checked the numbers.”
Press briefings will still be held, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to present questions directly to the president of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
We’ve tried to do this in many cases, and you’ve seen that we’ve done it in many cases in the last few weeks, and meetings that allow to speak with the president of the United States will replace press briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences when visiting dignitaries.
His press conferences alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated the reason for this, in an emancipated and sometimes bizarre appearance before reporters gathered at the scene.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland and addresses concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to staff from the European Union, employed by Scotland’s National Health Service, to express the country’s gratitude and ask that they remain after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jean Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed to meeting the cost of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its distributed public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “Over the summer, the Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and it is moving towards the decisions expected in the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that this time can be very worrying for all of you.
That’s why I wanted to come back and say how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the team, regardless of their citizenship.
Fellows from across the European Union and around the world bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we very much want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
The University of Tennessee Tigers' rear defender, Christion Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury from Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt University Commodore's group, Mike Org reported from Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the University of Tennessee team, told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the half-time.
“He went to the edge of the field and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercombe oxygen on the edge of the field and then put him on a stretcher and took him for further testing.
An official from the University of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercombe was transferred to surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/scope of the surgery" and the University of Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is an athletic student and this is his first season with the University of Tennessee following a transfer from Illinois.
He took part in a total of five fixtures before leaving the game, raising his total fixtures this season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK and the extra income will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Conservative plan.
The move will neutralize Corbyn's move to attract new voters
Stamp tax bills will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty rate when they buy a property in Britain - the extra income will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move appears to be an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters, with promises to provide cheaper housing and focus on high-income people.
The stamp tax will be imposed on people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the increase in revenue will strengthen the government’s move to help those who are sleeping under harsh conditions.
The payment, which comes as an addition to the current stamp tax, including higher tax levels on secondary residences and real estate investments for rent, may reach up to three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new properties built in London are acquired by foreign residents, a situation that raises prices and makes it difficult for people who buy a property for the first time to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp-tax cut to help young people buy a first home.
He blamed large construction companies for taking land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon the quotas on affordable homes and fix Britain’s housing scandal.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including policing rents and terminating evictions “without guilt.”
He also wants to give councils greater power to build new homes.
“Last year I said I would dedicate my term to the restoration of the British dream – the essence of which is that life is supposed to be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that people who do not reside in the UK, as well as companies based in foreign countries, will be able to buy houses just as easily as hard-working British residents.
“The dream of becoming a homeowner has become too distant for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping under difficult conditions is too realistic.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to run Scotland’
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his “ultimate ambition” was to become Scotland’s manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the revival challenge of the North-East Club, which is currently in third place in the Premier League, three points ahead of the rankings.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to No. 1 in Scotland last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
“I was in an international game once and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
But when I was growing up, I watched the Scotland team play Hampden a lot with my dad as a kid, and it was always something that drew me back.
This opportunity will only come if I manage the team.”
Sanderland's previous directors include Dick Adebokett, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Foyer, and Paulo di Canio.
The former manager of Aloe Athletic says he was not afraid to come after such well-established names at such a large club, having previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success will now be measured by: Can I return the club to the Premier League?
“Because of the structure and facilities at this club, there is no doubt that it belongs to Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I can only see myself as a success story here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross began his management career only three years ago, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumberton and 15 months as a team coach at Hearts.
Next, he helped Elo<0xC3><0xA9> get out of League C and raised St Mirren from the abyss to her status as champion the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his acting career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Polkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
“This must have been a real junction,” he recalls, about taking command of Alua.
“I really believed that the management position was more suited to me than the game.
It sounds strange because I played fine, I earned reasonably, and I enjoyed some reasonable records.
The career of an actor can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I’m still dealing with them when it comes to stress and stress at work, but management just feels right.
I’ve always wanted to run and now I’m doing it, and I’ve never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult.”

The perfect time for a pint beer is at 17:30 on Saturday, found in a survey
The summer heatwave has boosted profits for British pubs struggling for their existence, but has strained restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars enjoyed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July — but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent, the data revealed.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant, who compiled the data, said: “The significance of the continuation of the clear weather and the long-overdue participation of England in the World Championship is that July had a pattern similar to that of June, with pub revenues rising 2.8 percent, but the restaurants suffered even more from a severe blow.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant trade seen in June only worsened in July.
Drink-focused pubs and bars recorded the strongest performance, with a higher growth than the decline in restaurant business revenues compared to the previous period.
Food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, although their condition was less dramatic than that of restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pub and bar chains, the percentage of beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent over the month, and the percentage of food sales fell by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, author of RSM data analysis for leisure and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important sporting or social events are the most important factors when it comes to the outdoor entertainment market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, though a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to last year would be particularly painful in addition to all of the constant costs.
“The long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse moment for food-focused businesses, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August bring about a respite from what they need so much.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand launches.
The Sales Supervision Factor for the UK Pubs, Bars and Restaurants Sector, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 groups, with an integrated business cycle exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the benchmark for performance comparison set in the sector.
One in five children have social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a growth in fake insta pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students said they had a “head” account that they showed their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – creates social media accounts that he keeps secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts — a reference to the photo-sharing site, Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they run a clean Rush account to show their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account found that she was asking others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the School Administrators Association (HMC) of Independent Schools in the UK, found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles and half admit to having private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Ilid Doyle will serve as a "voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletes Board
Ilid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletes Board as an external director at the annual general meeting of the Board.
Doyle is the most decorated light athlete and chairman Ian Beatty has described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who guide the sport to benefit from its rich international experience over the past decade.
“Ilid has been honored by the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that the Scottish athletes will benefit immensely from bringing it to the board,” Beatty said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be a voice for athletes and hope to be able to really help guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is now regularly used as a BBC commentator, has lost his ability to walk after suffering a transient stroke.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I'll get better or to what extent.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, I re-learned how to walk and is currently performing agility and reaction speed exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement!”
Advertisement for milk pumps equating mothers with cows Party opinions online
A milk pump company has divided opinions online with an ad that compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of the pump, which is supposed to be the world’s first wearable silent milk pump, Elvie released a humorous video ad to demonstrate the freedom of action that the new pump is giving mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cows' barn full of hay to the sound of a song that included words like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not udders, it's my breasts."
The chorus of the song goes on to say: “I suck, I suck, I feed the babies, I suck, I suck, I milk my girls.”
But the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many said it sheds light on the “atrocities” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use the cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they too need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them within a few days after they are delivered,” she wrote.
Elvie’s milk pump is discreetly integrated into the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another response said: “Traumatized in a sense to the cow and to the calf.
But hey, why not use them to advertise a milk pump to mothers who are entitled to keep their babies?”
Another response was: “A completely disconnected advertisement.”
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was “laughing.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit crazy, but I was referring to its content.
“It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Another comment said: “It’s a funny advertisement for mothers who suck (often in their workplaces or in the bathroom) and feel like ‘cows’.”
This is not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women’s group discovers that they all danced with the discreet pumps inside their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who use a milk pump say they feel like cows.
But Elvie’s pump is completely quiet, with no pipes and no wires, it discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even come out while pumping.
Anna Bellarin, partner and head of the Early Childhood Development Department at Mother noted: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In making the comparison between self-expressing women and dairy cows, we wanted to put the pumping of milk and all the challenges it poses in the spotlight, and to demonstrate in an entertaining, recognizable way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked the trail for designer Martha Jacobowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in detention has surged even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, one reason being that the Trump administration’s discourse and policies have made it difficult to transfer the children to sponsors.
Typically, most sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by applying for child responsibilities.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members would have to hand over fingerprints, and that those data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified to Congress that the authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied for unsupervised child sponsorship.
The PA subsequently confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of sponsors or members of their homes are in the country illegally, and many of them are criminals from foreign countries.
That’s why we continue to pursue these people,” Mr. Albans said.
In order to address solutions for the children more quickly, officials introduced new laws that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days later as is customary under the previous regulations, the shelter workers reported.
Many will appear via video conference call, instead of face-to-face, to present their arguments for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for release will be deported quickly.
The longer these children remain in care, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, and this may lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, shelter workers said and reports released from the system in recent months.
Advisors say these concerns are mounting in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs of a child’s difficulties are likely to be neglected due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving the children to the city of tents without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to break up with friends could worsen the trauma that many are already dealing with.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
Addressing the U.N. General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moalem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext that they were fighting terrorism, and “will be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the rally.
Mualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to fight this holy battle until we clear the Syrian lands from the terrorist organizations and from “any illegal foreign presence” as one.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 fighters on the war-torn country’s soil.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions for their return were good, and blamed “certain Western countries” for “spreading irrational fears” that motivated refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them return,” he said.
They are politicizing an issue that should only be humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned against sending aid to rebuild Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent deal between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel outpost, has created an opportunity for progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that the military action would focus on jihadi fighters, including fighters from the victory front linked to al-Qaeda, who would be “destroyed.”
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee, composed of government and opposition members, to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moalem set conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, said that the work of the panel should be limited to “examining the provisions of the current constitution,” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberals expect, an impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
It will be the most dramatic finale in the history of the presidency of all time!
Currently, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, peak time viewing has more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers on MSNBC.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in peak hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show, broadcast on MSNBC, reached the top of cable ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news nights.
“It’s the fire that people are drawn to because it’s not something we understand,” said Neil Barr, executive producer of the ABC drama The Designated Survivor, about a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the beer.
Neal Scovel, an old comedy writer and author, “Only the Funny Parts: ...and some hard truths about infiltrating the Hollywood Men’s Circle,” has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Ms. Scovel told me.
Chaos has amusing value.
Of course, unlike all other TV shows, the plot lines coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade verdict, whether immigrant families could reunite and the health of the global economy.
Changing a channel or ignoring it is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you’re way beyond the limits of being an educated citizen when you find yourself watching for six hours on a panel of experts that discusses Bob Woodward’s use of a “secret informant” as a source of Paul Manafort’s <0x24>15,000 “fear,” the Bombers’ jacket of ostrich leather, the Washington Post’s “Full Clothes of Arrogance,” and the Washington Consequences.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Some of what he does, which feels like a reality show, is that he feeds you with something every night,” said Brett Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of History for Sale, about the changing team at the Trump show and the daily twists of the story.
You can't afford to lose one chapter or be left behind.
When I got to Mr. Place this week, it was bright outside with a temperature of about 26 degrees on the north coast of the island of Kauai, but he shut down to watch MSNBC, and he recorded CNN at the same time.
He was unable to disengage, not when Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Place told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Funds from outside sources flood the race for the closest midterm elections to Congress
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th district is facing a flood of funds, thanks to a reorganization of Congressional districts, which led to a two-member congressional race for the same seat.
The Pittsburgh suburb, whose borders have recently been redrawn, has placed Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who now represents Pennsylvania’s 12th district, largely overlapping with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the previous district division had misappropriated, and unconstitutionally, the results in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial blow in the election campaign between the financial weapons of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March Special Elections, which were widely watched, for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat belonged to the Republicans for over a decade, and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators expected an easy advantage for Democrats.
U.S. Considered Punishing El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Withdrawn
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with slight opposition from Washington.
Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump management team.
State Department officials have decided to repatriate the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama in response to “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan any more,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, which included drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in economic aid and targeted restrictions on visas, could hurt a Central American country with high rates of unemployment and murder.
As the internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America rejected an urgent conference that was supposed to focus on safety and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar conference last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, high-ranking government officials made clear their desire to promote the conference, ending all considerations of punishment against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now due to address the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, as a symbol of the importance the administration attaches to him, diplomats said.
And three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the hearings described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal discussions on condition that they remain anonymous.
Their explanations were confirmed by an external analyst, close to the government, who also spoke anonymously.
Studying History
The next obvious may come from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s alleged obstruction of justice, for which there is now significant evidence in public records.
Mueller is reportedly addressing his own investigation into whether Trump’s campaign has cooperated with Russia in its attacks on our campaign.
If congressional control changes, Trump will find himself accountable to this body at the exact moment he prepares to stand before voters again, and possibly a jury.
“There are a lot of questions here that start with ‘if’ and I don’t mean to argue that Trump’s fall is inevitable – not even for his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that affect how long the struggle lasts.
In 1938, German officers were willing to carry out a coup against Hitler, if only the West opposed and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to prevent the years of slaughter that had taken place as a result.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the march of democracy is unstoppable, accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the paper reported that last year he offered to secretly record the president and speculated about his inadequacy for the presidency.
Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh, recently requested, is incomplete or fair – or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is approved despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections and appoint a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will fall into a long winter nap.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, who also occupied the magnificent house I had in the past.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light Shabbat candles on the same table with the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Durrance of the Rangers is optimistic for the confrontation in Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and know that a win over the Austrians, after their impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the G-team in the European League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Durrance from appearing for the first time in the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use this result as a stepping stone for better performance.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
We went out into the game believing we could get something and get a point.
We could have won in the end but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out of the freeze in the second half and we were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European night.
"I hope we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push and get a positive result.
The past year has been really hard, with everything that's happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but there's a good feeling about the place now.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed.
Women stay awake because of this fear about retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they were talking to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to have the conversation,” said Holly Schneider, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
You can do it the following way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You won’t be able to prepare your family for treatment if you don’t express your wishes well in advance.
Use your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get treatment, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Share with your financial advisor: The advisor will also be able to help you find a way to pay for your expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with an amount of money to help cover expenses, or self-insurance with your capital – as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: Find an early solution to legal disputes on this occasion.
Find and map out a health force, a trusted person who will supervise your medical care and make sure that the professionals fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider signing a power of attorney when it comes to your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions in your place and ensure you pay bills if you are incompetent.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine your adult parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications or allergies?
Please note these details in a written plan to be prepared.

Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu, official sources said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The disaster cut off communications networks and officials responsible for the aid were unable to receive information from Dongale County, an area in northern Palu that was closer to the 7.5-mile source itself.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are some facts about Palo and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palo is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Centre, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017, according to estimates.
The city marked its 40th anniversary when it was hit by a tsunami and earthquake.
Dongala is a district that stretches over 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the province, an administrative area within the province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
The main sources of income in the province’s ‘Centre Sulawesi’ are fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal region of Dongale.
Another important source of income is nickel mining, which focuses mainly on Murvali, on the beach on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palo and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunami waves in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit the western Dongala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, known for its seismic activity and is permanently damaged by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra, on December 26, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, and over half of those killed died in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, causing a tsunami that erupted on the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck an area near the city of Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands, opposite Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit the province of Fedi Jaya Bache, causing destruction and panic, as the locals remembered the destruction following the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
The earthquake did not cause a tsunami in this case, but more than 100 people were killed from buildings that collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lumbok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Trac Palin, the eldest son of Sara Palin, Alaska's governor and former vice president, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Vasila, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reports of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaskan police forces.
According to the police report, when a miner tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-soo Partial facility under a <0x24>500 self-guarantee, according to a report by KTUU TV.
According to the network’s reports, he appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself “not guilty, for sure,” when asked to placate his claims.
Palin has been charged with three Type A offenses and could therefore be jailed for a year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He was also charged with a type B misconduct offense, under which he could be sentenced to a day in prison and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of weapons under duress in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia Tsunami and Earthquake: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off and the loss rate is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos, posted on social media, show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate at a beach festival in the city of Palo when a tsunami broke out on the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York City are seeking the death penalty for the suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out a bike-track attack on the side of the West Side Highway in southern Manhattan, and hit pedestrians and cyclists on the way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent for the death penalty application filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty can be demanded for these two charges.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury slapped Saipov with a 22-point indictment, including eight counts of extortion-assisted murder, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “meaningful, premeditated planning,” prosecutors said, describing how Saifov carried out the attack as “degradable, cruel and sick.”

Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the southern borough of New York claimed the death penalty in the case took place a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not express any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about his actions, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired by the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to police, he also asked to hang a ISIS flag in the hospital room where he was staying.
He claimed to be innocent in response to the 22-point indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s federal attorneys, said they were “disappointed of course” by the prosecution’s decision.
“We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of a guilty plea that would lead to life imprisonment with no possibility of release would only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Prague Should Be In Charge of Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Prague vows to “recruit the People’s Army” today during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former leader of the UKIP said politicians must “feel pressure” from the Eurosceptics, when a member of parliament of Theresa May’s Conservative Party said he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said at a rally in Birmingham that Britain “was already out” at this point if Prague had served as Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May, reconciling the deeply divided lines of the Conservatives, has been highlighted by the joining of conservatives who support remaining in the European Union to a different anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her compromise plan, the Chequer's, on its way despite attacks from Brexiteers, stay-at-homers and the EU.
The allies insisted that it would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the counter-reactions – forcing the Irospects and Labour to choose between its agreement and “chaos.”
Boone said at a meeting of the Leave Means Leave group in Solihull that he wanted to say goodbye to Ceres.
He argued that Prague should have been accepted as a member and be in charge of negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingboro added: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to say goodbye to Chequers.
He stressed his opposition to the European Union and said: "We did not fight in both world wars to be enslaved.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Boone dismissed the claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative MP and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also on the march and told reporters: 'I'm simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequer program is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular among our party and among our activists who took to the streets and chose us in the first place.
Please, drop the checkers and start listening.”
In a critical message to May, she added: “Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Prague said at the conference that politicians should “feel the pressure” if they are going to betray a resolution adopted in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s now a question of trust that we, the people, have with our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them, ‘We will not let you get away with it.’
He added, in a message to the enthusiastic audience: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel pressured.
“We call on the People’s Army of this country, who gave us the victory in Brexit and who will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
At that moment, the supporters of the stay marched on Birmingham and then held a two-hour conference downtown.
A handful of activists waved “Conservatives Against Brexit” posters after the group was formed over the weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis laughed at the opening of the Conservatives' conference about the security issues they suffered with the party's app.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology possible to have an agreement like Canada Plus, a frictionless border crossing and free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's totally ridiculous.
“There’s no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘seriously consider’ running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for midterm elections in November against Republican Jeff Dill, who served as co-chairman of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts election campaign.
She was at the center of rumors that she might run against Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke, which took place on Saturday afternoon, is the 36th meeting with voters in the city hall format since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to “come to Washington to fix our broken administration and to have a woman head.”
Arrest in case of Simms's death from LSU
Police in the Louisiana capital, Baton Rouge, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wade Simms was arrested on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson during a press conference at 11 a.m.
Police released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a person seen in the footage.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot and killed near Southern University campus early on Friday.
“Wade Simms suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually got rid of it,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, as reported by 247sports.
Wade tried to protect a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene with a gun and shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the Eastern District Police of Baton Rouge.
The Junior, who is almost two metres tall, played in 32 games with 10 starts in the last season and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton finishes world title after team rankings give him victory over Sebastian Wattle
It was clear, from the moment Walteri Bottas advanced to the next level before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that the Mercedes rankings would play an important role in the race.
From the first moment, Bottas had a good start, leaving Hamilton almost alone, defending his place in the first two rounds, and inviting Votel to attack his teammate.
Wattle went to the middle ground first and let Hamilton fit in with the competition's tail, a decision likely decisive.
The Mercedes team went to a stop later and returned to the race behind Wattle, but Hamilton moved forward after a tight wheel fight that eventually forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inland lane to hold on without risk after a double move in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the rankings and was in seventh place at the end of the first round.
He then led much of the race and did not change tires to get a quick finish and overtake Kimmy Reykonen to fourth place.
He eventually went down to an intermediate stop in the 44th round and was unable to increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds when Reikkonen took fourth place.
It's a tough day because Voltaire did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me bypass it.
The team did an extraordinary job of getting to the double,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made a mockery of Senator Diane Feinstein at a conference on Saturday over her insistence that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blazy Ford, accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying instead that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “bad and mean and liars.”
“The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see angry and mean and nasty and lying people,” he said.
“When you look at the publications and the leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July and was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s charges, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep the letter as confidential as she asked me to keep it confidential.”
But the senator’s denial did not appear to have been accepted by the president, who responded to it during Saturday night’s conference: “I tell you, that was really bad body language.
It may not be the leak, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and claimed that Democrats were using the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to return to power at all costs.
You see the wickedness, the despicable, they don’t care who they’re hurting, who they’re trampling on to power and power,” he said.
Top League: Dundee stars 5–3 against Belfast giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee stars made up for their loss in the top league on day 6 against the Belfast giants and won the next game 5-3, Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early advantage over two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis at Wheeler.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cawney brought their team back into business until Dwyer brought the giants back.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard was equalised for the Danes until two of Lucas's exiles, Landwald Nielsen, secured the victory.
This is the third loss of the senior league season for Adam Kif, who came from behind to beat the Danes 2-1 at Belfast on Friday.
This is the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the giants have won the previous three games.
Dwyer’s first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaul’s cooking, and David Rothford cooked Beverly’s goal by doubling the score four minutes later.
In the first trimester full of activity, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 until Matt Markwardt cooked Cawney's equal goal at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the giants' advantage during the first break when he scored his second goal in the evening, at the end of the first trimester.
The home team was rematched and Boshar scored again a goal that matched the power play at 27:37.
Cawney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give the Danes a lead for the first time in the game, at the end of the second trimester, and Nielsen secured the Danes’ victory with the fifth goal, which he scored from half the field in the last trimester.
The giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes on their home field in the next game on Friday.
An airline inspector gave his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane could escape an earthquake.
An Indonesian aviation inspector was crowned a hero after he sacrificed his life to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a strong earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Heavy concussions continue to hit the area and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palo.
But even though many of his colleagues had fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gnawan Agung refused to abandon his position, in a tightly wobbling control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Joffrey Airport in Buffalo.
He stayed in place to ensure that Battic Air Flight 6321 could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the tower thinking he was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian spokesman Johannes Sirite said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikhapan Airport in Clementen to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palo.
“Our hearts are broken to hear the word,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, as the Indonesian disaster relief agency says access to Dongala, Sigi and Botong is limited.
“The death toll is believed to continue to rise as many bodies are still buried under the rubble and access to many others is not possible,” agency spokesman Satopo Porvo said.
Waves up to six meters high destroyed Palo and the city will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and equipment.
Risa Kosuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances bring bodies every minute.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working quickly to help the survivors but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country’s soldiers: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
A plane crashed in Micronesia: Air New Guinea says one person missing after plane crash in Laguna
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed in the lagoon of the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, after declaring earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that starting Saturday afternoon, it was unable to say what had happened to one passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the island’s Chuk airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that the condition of all those remaining was stable.
The exact cause of the crash and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The U.S. Air Force and Navy said the plane landed in Laguna a short distance from the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane had reached a very low orbit.
“That’s a very positive thing,” said Janes.
Janes said he and the others managed to make their way to the emergency water exits at waist level on the sinking plane.
He said the plane crew was panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve the pier had also helped rescue operations, using an inflatable boat that brought people ashore before the plane sank into water about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
According to data from the Air Safety Network (ASN), 111 people have been killed in crashes by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air New Guinea was not involved in any of these incidents.
Analyst details the course of events the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution proved its case on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the movements of the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night of her murder.
According to the Clerion Ledger report, Rowlett said he received the location data from a number of cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with that of Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went out to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand and testified he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was with Sanford that night, Sanford said he was lying, “because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before she died.
The cell phone records said they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ text messages, conversations, and contact details from his phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing speech on Sunday, as planned.
The judge said he expects the trial to be adjourned to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is A Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative opinion of the genre and fills its music with positive messages.
The High Breed Trio from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved away from its sources as a tool for expressing political messages and attacking social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop repopular.
Artists like the Fujis and Commons have recently come to life in the UK through artists like Akala and Loki.
Another black man?
New York nurse sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' text message
A New York nurse sues a couple for dismissal for discrimination after receiving an unsolicited text message from the mother who complained that the nurse was “another black person.”
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to “blackmail.”
Lynsey Flasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that her new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
“No, no, no, no, no, no. Another black man,” Ms. Flasco-Flexman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Morris, twice.
According to the New York Post, after noticing the mouth drop, Plasco-Flachman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the former nanny, who was of African-American descent, had done a bad job, and that she was now expecting to hire a Filipino in her place.
Ms. Morris was paid for one day’s work and sent home with Uber.
Now, Morris sues the couple for the dismissal, asking for <0x24>350 a day for six months of work and accommodation where they were originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t do things like that,” she told the post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple fought back over the allegations that they were racists, saying that Morris's termination would have been requested, out of fear that they would not be able to trust her after she was harmed.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But did they put your child in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was an accident?
Your soft baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to “extortion” and said his wife was only supposed to give birth two months before the incident and was “in a very difficult situation.”
“You want to go after someone like her?
It’s not nice to do something like that,” added the investment banker.
The legal case is still in the process, but the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, killing their behavior and the arguments they used.
A new letter reveals Paddington publishers worried that readers would not identify with a talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jenkle, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It’s very amusing to know now what we know about Paddington’s tremendous success.”
After saying that her father, who worked for the BBC as a photographer before he was inspired to write the children’s book from a little toy bear, had become bloodthirsty about rejecting his work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication was bitter-sweet, after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of Paddington’s success, which she described as “a very important member of our family.”
“He was a quiet man, not a arrogant man,” she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who was achieving something: you're proud of him even though it wasn't really because of you.
I think he saw Paddington's success sort of like that.
“Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always said it was because of Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Ned called regularly and said that her condition was really bad, that she wasn't expected to last." Mrs. Adnan-Laparos said.
“Then I got a call from Ned saying that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I needed to say good-bye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating slowly disappeared and went out of her system.
She died sometime before and it's over. It's all over.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t whine or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people right now.
I really had to hold on.”
In the end, Mrs. Adnan-Laparos, now mourning the loss of her daughter, got on a plane alongside other passengers who were unaware of her agony journey.
No one will know,” she said.
My head was flat, and tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had this incredible sense of identification with Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women hang postcards on bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hung postcards on a bridge in Walsh with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Mrs. Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don’t want any other parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone recognized him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room.”
But he stopped working before he died, because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: “I am constantly afraid of a chain reaction.”
Ms. Davis created the postcards, “so that people know there’s someone you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit still – you need to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, Mrs. Davis’s longtime friend, lost Mark, a life partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at a low point on Christmas Day — when the kids opened the presents, he didn’t make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a tremendous trauma to them, but that they had overcome it: “It creates a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought, if we could really get what he asked for — a time-limited and limited investigation — maybe we could bring a little bit of unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “be torn apart” in the deep-rooted party deadlock.
Why were Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not interested in the FBI investigation?
All of their deterrence stems from the timing.
The midterm elections will take place in just five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, Republicans do not succeed in them, they will be very weak in their attempts to elect the man they want to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to break parity and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawman said.
Park Byung-Sig, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Union, said the number of defections last year was 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main reasons for the move were tougher border controls between North Korea and China and higher amounts charged to people smugglers.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors end up receiving South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them are fleeing through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and which is easier to cross than the well-guarded DMZ between the two Koreas.
China treats deserters as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which technically are still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this week, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
The meeting followed the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where the two generally agreed to move toward an era in which the Korean Peninsula would not have nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of the lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate "hysterical" and said his character did not allow him to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi responded to this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman ever appeared like this, they would say ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blazy Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes almost screamed and suffocated when talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee and called the arguments against him a "coordinated and gruesome character murder" organized by liberals over Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed prejudice against Democrats.
“I think he discredited himself with these statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to oust Kavanaugh if his appointment was approved, and if Democrats won a majority in the House.
“I’m saying it this way — if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI then he’s not fit, not just for a term in the Supreme Court, but also for the court he’s currently in,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District of Columbia Federal Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she has concerns about Kavanaugh’s possible rulings against Obama’s health reform or Roe vs. Wade’s ruling because he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh evaded questions about the possibility of rescinding certain Supreme Court decisions.
“There’s no reason for a hysterical and bribed person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘It’s not great,’” Pelosi said.
And women need to use it.
It’s a harsh criticism, months and years of rage are overpowering, and she can’t express them without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, do you?”
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager elsewhere, who said that she too was crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique and every time she got angry and started crying, she used to say to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they are intrinsically misunderstood.
One of my most significant memories of a job early in my life, in an office with a masculine majority, was that I once found myself crying in an inexpressible rage, and an older woman grabbed my back, a cool manager from whom I was always a little scared — and dragged me into the stairwell.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they’ve been able to suppress you.”
Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado congresswoman at the time, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and exited the race, Schroeder, who was deeply frustrated, realized there was no reason she would not consider running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a decision I thought about very well,” she told me 30 years later and laughed.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since she joined the campaign late, she fell behind in fundraising, so she vowed not to join the race unless she raised <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who donated <0x24>1,000 to men, gave her only <0x24>250.
“They think I’m getting a discount?” she wondered.
During her speech announcing she would not embark on an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions — gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters instead of representatives, and anger at sexual discrimination — she was suffocated by tears.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled how the press had reacted.
“You’d think I was sponsored by Clinx.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
"She was crying"?
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The opening barrages of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and although the fight is far from over, a rift between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the opening shot earlier this year by imposing a tax on China’s important export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 million) worth of goods, effectively imposing taxes on half of the goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing reacted each time in the same currency, and recently raised tariffs by five to 10 percent on <0x24>60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has vowed to return a blow to every blow from the United States, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will surrender in the near future.
A request from Washington to retaliate would mean surrendering to its demands, but a public bow to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President <0x58>i Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing manages to do well, the pressures from the trade war with the U.S. could favor China in the long run and reduce the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of an economic downturn in each of the countries is actually much more dangerous than India had previously anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research partner at the New American Security think tank.
Syria ‘ready’ to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by a long war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress achieved in the war on terror,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions now exist for the refugees to return voluntarily to the country they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at harming their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moalem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the regime would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from countries that funded the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 – 10.5 on the La Golf National track outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points it needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mikaelson, who struggled for almost the entire tournament, sent his t-strike to the water in Par-3’s 16th hole, losing the game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has blitzed in all of his rounds, becoming one of four players to reach 5-0-0 since the tournament's start in the current structure, in 1979.
American actor Jordan Sepith was defeated 5th and 4th by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olsen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world’s top-ranked player, lost 2-1 to Ian Paulter from England, possibly the last time he will play in the Ryder Cup.
With a record eight Ryder Cup appearances, Spanish Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a has become the European player with the highest number of wins in tournaments with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a rough year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the trophy back.
It’s a team, and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He delivers the torch to his countryman John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in Sunday’s Solo Game.
“The immense pride I feel is to defeat Tiger Woods, which I watched growing up,” Ram, 23, said.
Woods has lost all four games in France and his record is now 13-21-3, with the Ryder Cup in his career.
These are odd statistics from one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, with only Jack Niklaus in front of him.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find their way through the lawns, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Pinau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furick said after his team’s disappointing performance, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Well done to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as captain.
We need to take off the hat.
We've been defeated."
