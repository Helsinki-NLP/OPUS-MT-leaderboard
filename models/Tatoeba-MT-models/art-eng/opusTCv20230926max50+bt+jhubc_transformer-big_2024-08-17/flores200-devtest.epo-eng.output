Although one experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce the Ebola mortality rate, so far no medication has been clearly shown to be usable to cure the existing infection.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promising in the field, but formal studies indicate that it is less useful than one would like to avoid death.
In a PALM test, ZMapp served as a check-up, meaning that scientists used it as a etalon to compare three other medications to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and acknowledges that the Olympic family certainly needs a safe environment development for all our athletes.
We agree with UOK's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, can be better provided with a move forward with significant changes within our organization than with a certificate clearance.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on this as a misdirection of the scale, so courageously described by Larry Nassar's survivors, could remain unnoticed for so long, and welcome any needed and adequate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the UOK have the same goal - to make the gymnastic sport, and the others, as safe as possible, so that athletes follow their dreams in a safe, positive and powerful environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but also provides details that the fossils cannot provide, such as a color or three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown with pale or carotenoid-colored lower edges.
The discovery also gives an understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed stem, called rachi, but do have other features of feathers—branches and twigs—the researchers concluded that the rachi is probably a later evolutionary achievement, than those other features.
According to the structure of the feathers it is thought that they were not used for flying, but more likely for heat regulation or for display. The researchers speculated that the specimen shows adult plumage and not chick down, although it is a young dinosaur's tail.
The researchers speculated that the specimen shows adult plumage and not an idyllic downpour, although it refers to the tail of a young dinosaur.
A bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey last morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

The glow and rotation are used in combination to determine a Rossby rate of a star that is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby rate, the less active is the star in the case of magnetic inversions.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observation made about the galaxy.
The team sought the effect that tidal forces would cause between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon applies pull to Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also applies force to the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the way of habitual matter.
This theory holds that the darkest matter around a galaxy surrounds a galaxy as a kind of halo and consists of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug Resilient Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview he said the new variant is "very annoying and alarming because it has a very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have been infected by the bacterium in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two of them are healthcare workers from the hospital.
An infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people a year.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of tuberculosis patients appears to be small; 6,000 of the total 330 000 infected at any given time in South Africa.

In France voting has traditionally been a technologically simple experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place the beforehand printed sheet of paper with an indication of their preferred candidate in an envelope.
Once officials confirm identity of the voter, the voter enters the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law strictly codifies the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that there are no envelopes before the start of the election and that no envelopes are added other than those of the orderly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each phase of the process. Evening volunteers count the votes under attentive control, according to specific procedures.

The Police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
D K Arya said: "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and recovered her cell phone and laptop".
The defendants are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants appeared in court with sheltered faces.
Although three people were in the house, when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver received serious injuries to the head.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya remained in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court, charged with the murder of his son.
She is guarded while awaiting official indictment and sentencing, but any deposition by a witness may be biased, as her image has been widely publicized.
It is customary practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scots law works differently, and courthouses view publication of photographs possibly prejudiced.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists do seem to approach a dangerous line if they post photos or other details of suspects."
A Crown Office, which is generally responsible for the prosecution, told journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the charge is made.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the dispute over borders that Palestine wants to have based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle Eastern War.
Other relevant issues, it is said, will include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan valley.
Israel claims a continued military presence in the valley for ten years after signing an agreement, while the PA agrees to let the presence for only five years.
Gunmen in the test of auxiliary pest control had to be closely inspected by the foresters, while the test was studied and its effectiveness evaluated.
In paternity with NPWS and the Australian Association of Sports Practitioners (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers will be provided as part of the Association of Sports Packers' hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, a substitute to the Director of Conservation of Parks and Heritage at NPWS, the four selected for the first firing operation shooters received detailed instructions on safety and training.
Martelly was sworn in on a new nine-member Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's first CEP for four years.
Last month a presidential committee recommended resignation of the former CEP as part of a resource set to promote the country to new elections.
The committee was a response by Martelly to the widespread anti-regime protests, which began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were evoked by a failed organizing of elections, some postponed from 2011.
Approximately 60 occurrences of overheating of non-functioning iPods are reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving minor burns to four persons.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MEKI) has reported that 27 accidents related to the devices are known to it.
Last week, MEKI announced that Apple had reported 34 new incidents of overheating, which the company calls "minor".
The ministry responded, calling a delay of the report by Apple "really regrettable".
The earthquake shook Marianon at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Center for Tsunami Warning also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong as hostages, capturing their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot with his M16 rifle at the tourists.
A number of hostages have been released and at least six have been confirmed to date.
Six hostages, among them children and old men, were released earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an old woman who needed a toilet. Mendoza was gunned down.
Liggins followed an example of his father and opted for a career in medicine.
He learned as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature childbirth during his free time.
His research showed that delivery of hormone accelerated maturation of fetal lung in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" on Wednesday, flight recorders.
There were also a lot of people who were attracted to the moon.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Quite unique, like herself.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as strange as I... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Out of 1400 people questioned before the 2010 federal elections, the number of those opposed to becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal elections campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those in the poll share this view, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II would be the last Australian monarch.
In the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia will never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had to swim 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his grievances, there was doubt of his ability.
He could not use remedies needed to experience his pain, as they are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on 25 January discovered the largest known for today's prime number.
Some people confirmed the exposure, using a variety of devices and software, until early days of February, and it was declared on Tuesday.
Comets can eventually be a source of water supply for the Earth, as well as organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed, as comets began to collide with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his reign earlier this year and last month signed a bill that legalizes same-sex marriages.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and bullshit."
He is expected to be elected president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that according to FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to older terrestrial radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate flight devices with greater accuracy and to give pilots more accurate information.
There is no additional transport, and the onshore trains will not stop in Wembley, nor parking or park-and-chair possibilities can be found at the site.
Fear of lack of transportation has raised a probability that the game will be played forcefully behind closed doors, without supporters of the team.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have related that the new species evolved only in two generations, although this process is believed to have taken longer, due to a pairing between endemic Darwinian finch, Geospiza forts, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be formed in a wide variety of shapes; it can be rolled up to thin shapes.
It can be pulled to attain a thin wire, which can be folded and braided. It can be hammered or crushed to a leaf.
It can be made very thin and stick to another metal. It can be so thin that it was once used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using a red beet juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basal (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates a quantity of hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen Ions are protons that have been deprived of their electrons (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and, therefore, with clean wet hands, compress them ball-shapedly.
Wetness on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will make you feel strange and shape like a shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a water-spray cloze almost in each house, linked to a complicated canal cluster.
Remains of canal altar have been found in the houses of Minoan towns of Krito and Santorini in Greece.
In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in a mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the phone call and reflects it down, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts partially light and visual light.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The biggest thing enabled by the wheel is providing much easier and faster transportation.
We have a train, a car and a lot of other vehicles.
Below them are medium-sized cats, which feed on medium-sized prey on the scale from hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including homeless pet cats), which eat the much more numerous prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is a concept of the niche, a specialization that retains every cat, so they don't have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats, they live in groups called herds.
Herds make up from one to three closely related adult males and many up to thirty females and offspring.
The females are usually in close kinship with each other, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion's herds function quite similar to herds of wolves or dogs, which surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behaviour, as well as very deadly for prey.
A very harmonious athlete, a tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump at great distances and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
A tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) with lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can get fat.
The tiger's fat is not like the full-voiced fat of a lion, but rather like a phrase of raucous, exclaiming words.
Ocelots like to feed on small animals; they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds as much as possible.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find edible animals (prey) by smell, smelling the footprints on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with nocturnal vision, and also move very imperceptibly. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflageing themselves in the vicinity and then jumping on them.
When a small group of living creatures (small population) divides from the main population, from which it comes (such as if they cross a mountain or river, or if they move to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from where they were before.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population will have to, in order to be a strong competitor, have other features or adaptations compared to those they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they are still in need of the same adaptations as before.
As time passes, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they begin to look less and less similar to the other population.
Finally, with the passage of thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an indispensable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans inhale, and they take away carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also give shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant material. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosaurus was the highest predator of its time, so it was not afraid, except for other mossosaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an additional set in its roof, which means that nothing that encountered it could escape.
Not sure, but it may have had a bifidial tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mossauros, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that had entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus would be unopposed against it.
Although we would recognize most of their food, Romans did have their set of strange or unusual feasting articles, including wild pig, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women were eating their food sitting in chairs, rich men liked to have dinners together, where they would rest on their sides, eating their dishes.
Among the dishes of Ancient Rome there could be no food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
Babylonians built for each one their god a major temple, which was considered the home of the god.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to take care of the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and also an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East the house was not so important.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family took place in the fresh air.
Women were cooking in the courtyard; shops were simply open counters in front of the street; stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
In the Norwegian sagas it is said that Erik the Red had been expelled from Iceland for murder, and along the way further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've watched the National Treasure film, you can think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although on the back of the document is scripture, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence dated on 4 July 1776".
Although no one is sure who wrote this, it is known that in early days of its existence the great parchment document (its dimension is 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches per 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) was coiled for holding.
So the note was probably added simply as a label.
The landings of the day D and the following battles liberated the north from France, but the south still remained not free.
It was ruled by the French of "Vichy". These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the free French forces liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture co-owned by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and also this somehow defines the dimension of society.
City-states are precursors of nations. Civilizational culture understands the transmission of knowledge through a number of generations, a lasting cultural trace and a fairly large dissociation.
Less large cultures often disappear without leaving in question historical testimony and fail to be recognized as appropriate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—with congress as its sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to collect taxes and, because there was no national executive or judicial branch, it entrusted execution of its decisions to the agencies of the states, which often were not co-operative.
It also could not override tax laws and customs among states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before any change, and states referred to the central government so easily, that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, and also Germany's national football team, are the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and auto racing F1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, so Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the composition/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical sense, as an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan began long ago in the 15th century, when European sailors in passing recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company founded a base in south-western Taiwan, beginning to transform the native ways of grain production and employing Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) occupied western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and proclaimed Taiwan a province of Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the treaty of Shimonoseki, to which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better picture of what they originally looked like.
Until 1976 30 centers of Machu Picchu were restored and the renovation continues to this day.
For example, the most common in the world format to photograph static images is 35 mm, which was the dominant motion picture dimension at the closing of the era of analog film.
It is still being produced today, but, which is more important, its proportion has been inherited from the sensor formats of digital cameras.
The format 35 mm is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 34 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Several popular formats (APS format, for example) are equal or very close to this proportion.
The much insulted and often ridiculed rule of thirds is simply a guideline creating dynamism, holding a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective location of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image by thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, became an object of critical research.
In the course of more than a thousand years the Christian religion joined European states despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-pervading power touched everyone from a king to a citizen.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to reduce suffering and poverty, and that church funds exist specifically for this purpose.
For more than a thousand years the central authority of the Church has been in Rome and this concentration of power and money has caused many to doubt whether this dogma is obeyed.
Shortly after the flare of fighting, Britain initiated a maritime blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved its effectiveness, it cut off major military and civilian deliveries, although this blockade broke a generally accepted international law codified by a number of international agreements of past two centuries.
Britain has traversed international waters to prevent any vessels from entering into entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
As such a tactic had a limited reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its open-ended military use of submarines.
During the 1912s the dominant attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and brutalities of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid a return to such a situation in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a poetic book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his administrator at the previous workplace) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own way of displaying various periods of time; every era in China or every family that ruled was a separate dynasty.
Also among all dynasties was a fluctuating period of divided provinces.The best known of such periods was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods fierce fighting took place among many noblemen struggling over the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest eras in ancient China's history, thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest chair in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of a metric system, transition from authoritarianism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, after the Revolution posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed success of the most ambitious and successful.
The same is true of the military, because instead of military ranks previously based on class, they are now based on personality.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people of working class in other countries to trigger their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this daily life. He resorted to a cave that became known as "Hira'" on Mount Noor for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has been preserved over time, gives a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is absolutely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists. When you're in the cave, that's total isolation.
Nothing else can be seen except the cloudless, gorgeous sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is the only one of seven miracles that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramid structures built to honor a dead pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains a number of pyramids (among which the great pyramid is the largest), some small tombs, some temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and among the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples many were built to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "arch up" mark looks like V and the "arch down mark" like a bracket or square without an underside.
Upstairs means you have to start at the top and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the heel (it's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow up usually produces a more delicate sound, while the bow down is stronger and firm.
Don't hesitate to add your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed string marks are there for a musical reason, so usually they should be observed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-years-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the sister of King Elizabeth on 6 October 1789 were brought back to Paris from Versailles by a host of bazaar women.
They travelled to Paris with a wagon, surrounded by a crowd, rumbling and screaming threats against the king and queen.
The crowd caused the king and queen to wide open the windows of the cart.
At one point a crowd member waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The military expenditures of U.S. imperialism in conquest of the Philippines paid off itself the Filipino people.
They had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to pay back a large portion of the expenses and the percentage of the bonds circulating in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.
Of course, the surplus profits emanated from the vast exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic income of U.S. imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that helped the foundation of the Order.
The era in which the events took place is usually called the Middle Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
Before the Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages and followed it the Late Middle Ages, which ends by agreement around 1500.
Technological determination is an umbrella term that virtually covers a wide variety of ideas, from technological thrust or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny drives underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influences, and that technology in turn has for societies "consequences" of its own, and not socially conditioned.
For example, it is possible to say that the car has to be driven.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically possible for only a handful of cars, so new methods of production are designed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to higher incidence of accidents on the road, which leads to the invention of new health care techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, taken from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography modulated individuals and with the passage of time habits and culture related to that geography emerged, and these, more harmonious with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashionable capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC.
In the twelfth century its status degenerated mainly because the Crusaders returned with silks and spices considered more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine bazaars.
It was at that time that the title Moda Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style had a peak in the period between the 10th – 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning garments greatly influenced the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow media, styles in the west could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the important achievements of the period was that people began to use buttons to fix clothes as a result of the crusades.
Life agriculture is agriculture made to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Lifelong agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using saved seeds native to the ecoregion with rotation of crops or other relatively simple techniques to increase harvest.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still true in many developing states.
Subcultures unite people from similar viewpoints who feel distracted by social norms, and allow them to foster the sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguishable due to the age, ethnic belonging, class, location and/or genus of the members.
The features determining for a subculture as separate, may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors.
Subculturals often sign their membership by recognisable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, affectation and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to mention the few unfortunate occurrences of children who when growing up from neglect, mishap, or malicious mistreatment have not been socialized by adults.
Some feral children were imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases such abandonment by a child was due to the rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical disability by the parents.
Wild children could experience severe maltreatment or injury before being abandoned or escaping.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in nature on their own.
Educated only by non-human animals, the feral child shows behaviors (in the frame of physical limitations) almost entirely similar to those of the certain caring animal, as well as its fear or indifference to man.
While project-based learning is to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes a further step.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a tool that provides support to individuals within a new learning experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, and a teacher is a variant of scaffolding and the small paper clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is embedded into software and must ask, suggest and explain procedures, which might be difficult for the learner, if he acted by himself.
Children find themselves in trusteeship for a variety of reasons, which vary from neglect to maltreatment and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not supportive, caring and educational, but still that happens.
We view the trust system as a safety zone for such children.
Our trust system must provide safe homes, loving care, stable education, and reliable health care.
"Courage must provide all that is needed for them in the house from which they were taken first."
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The special features of the Internet give additional dimensions to the theory of uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motives for using the Internet (James, 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) have also identified "personal envelopment" and "continuous relationships" as new motivational aspects when they explored public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to major exposures in the interpretation of microexpressions, motions of a face, which last a few milliseconds.
It is said that it is possible to tell if a person is lying by the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks in his article The President's Speech pointed out that people who can't understand speech due to brain injury, however, can correctly evaluate sincerity.
He even assumes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
The research in the twentieth century showed that there are two sets of genetic variation: secreted and represented.
Mutation adds new gene variation, and selection removes it from the group of visible variation.
Separation and recombination remix the variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system, such as humans, to satisfy their needs for amino acids from available growths.
Additionally, failure to do so has serious consequences: a decrease in growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible resources of growth plants would be proteins that can be obtained from leaves and bees, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
Conversely, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide high-quality proteins that contain the essential amino acids.
If we look at all the circumstances, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in some way similar to how chimpanzees do in savannah today.
Sleep cessation is the process of intentional awakening during your usual sleep period and sleep after a short period of time (10–60 minutes).
This you can easily do, using a relatively low alarm clock to get up again without fully waking up.
If you notice that you are resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be left on the other side of the room, which will cause you to get up to turn it off.
Among others based on biorhythms options is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleep, this will cause you to get up to urinate.
The extent of internal peace a person has, negatively correlates with the extent of tension in the body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive force is in life. Every person has the power to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle on the path to that goal is your own tension and negativism.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by a Mahāyāna path of love and by many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundaline yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In kundalineal yoga the kundalineal energy (energy of enlightenment) is vecate by yoga positions, breath exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is the divine yoga. Depicting various deities, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated, and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war a clash of systems, processes and cultures led to the separation of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies, and the cold war began.
It would have lasted the next 40 years and had real battles, with replacement armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939 the Polish defence was already broken, the only hope remained to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were dropped almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and formed the Belarus and Ukrainian Fronts after an invasion of the eastern regions of Poland, breaking the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international contracts, and bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships for transporting goods is the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Navy's work has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, at the same time preventing your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
Most notable among the recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them because of easy access to milk, wool, meat and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds wandering on hills and other pastures, often attended by goatsmen, who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more widely known herder.
Wagon roads have been built in England since not earlier than the 16th century.
Although wagonways simply consisted of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve further speeds and to pull heavier loads, than on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
Steps appeared early enough to hold the tracks on the spot. Poiomete however it became clear that tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron stripe above.
This became a popular practice, but iron led to faster wear of wooden wheels from the railroad cars.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron. In 1767 the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known transportation was by gait, people began to go vertically two million years ago with the advent of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, australopithecus, did not go vertically as often.
Biped specialization is found at fossils of australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthropes probably went on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to relate more cordially to the environment, we can join the environmental protection movement and we can even be activists to some degree reduce the future suffering.
This is like anti-symptom medication in many cases. However, if we want not only a temporary solution, then we need to find the causes of the problems and we need to deactivate them.
Of course, the world has greatly changed the scientific and technological achievements of humanity, and problems have become greater due to overpopulation and a wasteful way of life of humanity.
After Congress accepted it on 4 July, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the printing house of John Dunlap, a few quarters away.
At night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap's Posters".
The first public reading of the document fulfilled John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent on 6 July to George Washington, who had read it to his troops in New York City on 9 July.
Dunlap's 25 posts, of which they are known to exist, are the oldest remaining copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are living today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have plumage and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble a dinosaur.
They have legs with scales and talons, they let out eggs and they walk on their two hind legs, like Tyrannosaurus.
Almost all currently used computers are based on processing information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number may have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, using computer slang.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough to prevent an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of a drug or a toxic operating chemical.
Check the label for specific instructions on first aid for this specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term is derived from longstanding familiarity with lithocymes, which are insects adapted to parasitism of humans.
Raccoons and lithocytes are both nidicular, adapted to living in their host's nest or dwelling.
Throughout the United States there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disorder among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and the optic nerve.
Research has found that women have a twice higher probability of getting MS than men.
A couple may decide that raising a child does not comply with their interests, or interests of their child, best.
Such couples may choose to plan an adoption for their baby.
During an adoption procedure, the biological parents lift their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand by scientific method how the world works. This method actually guides most scientific research.
It is, however, not alone; also an experiment, and an experiment is a test used to remove one or more possible hypotheses, questioning and observation guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers concentrated their attention on texts and especially on Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology have been accepted.
While Greek proficiency declined, the West proved to be separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often critically depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and how the biological clock produces them.
Periodic rhythms, which do not simply correspond to the external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators, which continue a period of recurrent self-contained operation even without external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading assumptions that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, marking either the DNA in the bacteriophage by radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage by radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a spectrum of various effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the wrapped piece of genetic material and whether the wrapped cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in the cells of a germinal line can pass to children, while mutations in other areas can lead to death of a cell or cancer.
Natural-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the visual, including a thriving and faunal living nature.
Among the examples of local activity are hunting, fishing, photographing, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit Borneo and here to photograph and learn about orangutans.
Every morning people leave small towns with cars to go to their place of work, and are passed by others whose purpose is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic commuting every way is wrapped up and contributing in a transportation system based on the use of private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has formed the biosphere of one of its stable states, which has been supporting human development for the last two million years.
Every person participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, we rarely hear a similar level of complaints about the quality of water or about the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems follow such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent?
Traffic Flow is the study of motion of separate drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because one cannot predict a driver's behavior with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly uniform arrangement; thus traffic flows strive to have some moderate uniformity and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To present traffic flow better, relationships between the three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, prepare and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings throughout the body.
This gives them a wider choice of small hiding places against pets.
Today the only insects that cannot fold back the wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said the Solar System was moving around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It's hard to believe that the Earth is moving, isn't it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the largest river on Earth, carrying more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water flowing into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long and collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Although construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, no one ever managed to overcome the pyramids of Giza according to the size and technical skill of their construction.
Egyptians of the New Empire were astonished at the monuments of their predecessors, who were then much more than a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is about 800 people.It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its laws and official relationships.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People knew of the basic chemical elements—such as gold, silver and copper—of antiquity, for these can be found in nature in basic form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he further theorized that they become new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that in the periodic table there are many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Certainly, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
One can also have alloys, in which there are small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made up of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could be pushed into a point at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good help to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, due to the advent of new ways of writing, the pencil has been dropped for lower status and use.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil tipper.
You can only ask yourself what will become of the keyboard when something new comes.
The fission bomb works on such a principle that energy is needed to compose a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a slope. Breaking the nucleus so again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break up with some or no touch.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called a crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the concealed side.
It is less thick under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more seas on the near side, as the crust is less thick. It was easier for lava to spill onto the surface.
Content theories concentrate on finding out what causes people to act or challenge them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that were internalized during maturation to adulthood.
These theories explore what is about certain people, what makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Theory of Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two modes of conduct may appear, when administrators begin to lead their former equals. One edge of the spectrum is an effort to remain "one of the friends" (or confidantes).
This type of administrator scarcely makes unpopular decisions, performs disciplinary actions, assesses the effectiveness of work, tasks and demands responsibility from people.
On the other side of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognisable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done before, and adopt it.
Finally, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often such behavior results in cracks between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of high quality, as traditional teams, but there are fine differences.
Members of virtual teams often serve as a point of contact of their unsophisticated physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a traditional team, as their teams may meet along various time zones, which may be misunderstood by their local administrators.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization like to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? one goal to start using virtually the concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used across the operating departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, when an organization works together to overcome an obstacle, it can lead to a new innovative process to serve the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data delivers physical proof for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. It thus narrows the research area and makes it more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior causes scientists to continue the research.
There is a long-term well-known fact that various types of brain damage, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and change some mental functions.
The progress of new technologies allows you to view and explore brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI has a strong touch of scientific fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science that engages in learning and integrated adaptation in a machine.
Research into AI involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Among examples are control, planning and timing, ability to answer diagnoses and questions from a client, and also recognizing handwriting, voice and face.
These issues became separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the branches of economics, medicine, engineering and warfare, it is also incorporated into a number of home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are an important part of any teaching. Quite often a teacher would like to take his students to places inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual excursions. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art, sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a trip virtually is another great way to think about travel and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, Bennet School students in North Carolina produce a website about their excursion to the state capital, a new version of the website appears every year, but the old versions remain accessible to use as an album.
Blogs can also help improve writing in learners. While students often start their blog experience with a blundering grammar and orthography, the presence of the public generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical public, the blogger takes the lead in improving his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "makes learners become more understanding about the world around them." The need to nurture interest from the public inspires learners to be wise and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is an instrument that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning outside the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable learners to become more analytical and critical; actively responding to online materials, learners can define their positions in the context of other people's writing and also outline their own point of view on certain problems (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming bilingual capital of Canada and it has a set of art galleries and museums that depict the past and present of Canada.
Further south lies the Niagara Falls and the north is home to Muskoka's pristine natural beauty and beyond.
These and more issues highlight Ontario as what outsiders think is essentially Canadian.
Vast areas further north are rather thinly inhabited, some are almost uninhabited wilderness areas.
This comparison of populations surprises many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than Canadian citizens overall.
The Islands of East Africa are located on the Indian Ocean, on the African east bank.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, with regard to wildlife, it is an independent continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or linked to France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region and it was heavily rooted in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonialism of Europe began in the 15th century, when explorer Vasco da Gama of Portugal initiated the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region borders Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of the true marriage.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not as it looks too expensive).
Women should note that cultural differences can result in what would be regarded as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, retained by the arm etc.
Be firm when you disagree with propositions from men and don't be afraid to back down (no matter whether cultural or not, difference is not necessarily to be tolerated!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and used it as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
Destroyed by the Portuguese, it was rebuilt by them with the name Casa Branca, but they left after an earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the sultan of Morocco under the name Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants, who set up trading posts there, called it Casablanca.
In terms of shopping, Casablanca is among the most uninteresting places in Morocco.
Around the old city centre it is easy to find shops of traditional Moroccan goods, such as tajines, ceramics, leathers, narghiles and a whole range of bristles, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east of Rwanda.
In 2002 the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, covering most of the city's urban streets, mainly in the center of the city.
Goma offers sufficient security, but one must be informed of every visit outside of it in order to know the state of the battles still taking place in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano in addition to the cheapest tracking of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to drive through Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
In addition to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctu" has been used as a metaphor of exotic and distant countries.
Today Timbuktu is a poverty-stricken city, but it is a tourist attraction due to its reputation and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was inscribed on the red list of world heritage sites by the threatening sands of the desert.
It was one of the most important stops on PBS's Wonders of the African World special program made by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is very contrasting with the rest of the country's cities, as it has a style more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and runs east along the Mozambique border, north to Zimbabwe and south to Crodile River.
The park comprises 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, all of which support different animals.
It features one of the most important sights in South Africa and is considered to be the most symbolic among the South African National Parks (SANPARKs).
Like all South African National Parks, there are day-to-day conservation entrance fees for the park.
It is also useful to buy Wild Card, which provides entry, either to selected parks of South Africa, or to all South African National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives the territory its name and it is the place that many tourists regard as the most interesting.
The line of buildings, which creates the Hong Kong skyline, has been compared to a glittering histogram, which is evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views to Hong Kong, leave the island and cross to the front, which is located at the coast of Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong's urban growth is concentrated on land that has been gained from the sea off the north coast.
This is the place which the British colonialists have acquired, and therefore, if one seeks proof of the colonial past of the territory, this is a convenient place to seek.
Sundarbans is the world's largest seaside mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) across the coast onwards to Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
The forest, however, is not just a mangrove marshland. In it are some of the last refuges of the imposing jungles that once covered the gangetic plain.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water or marshes.
In 1966 Sundarbans became a reserve and it is estimated that there are currently 400 royal tigers in Bengal and over 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-county bus station (across the river) all day, but the majority depart between the 6:30 and the 7:30, particularly those driving west and to Jakar or Bumthang.
Since the intercounty buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days before.
The majority of the districts connect small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Common taxis are fast and comfortable conveyors to travel to nearby locations, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a station bridge. It skips the Oyapock River, connecting the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters wide and it has two corridors 3,50 m wide.
The vertical under the bridge is 15 meters away. The construction ended in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are scheduled to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most notable indigenous group living at this site, which is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters, who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycur<0xC3><0xBA> and Payaguá, who lived from hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly under the name "La Grande Province of the Indies", came about as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began an era of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since then, when Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its native character and identity.
Argentina is very well known for its teams and players of polo are among the best in the world.
The most important tournament in the year takes place in December in the polo fields at Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas.
You can also watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
Get in touch with Asociación Argentina de Polo on news of tournaments and where tickets of polo matches are purchased.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent to the pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
All over the islands, British pounds are generally accepted, and in Stanley, credit cards and U.S. dollars are also accepted.
On the outer islands credit cards may not be accepted, but British and American money may be taken; first ask to know which payment method is accepted.
Since it is almost impossible to change a counterfeit currency outside the islands, change the money before leaving.
Since Montevideo lies south of the equator, in it is summer, when in the northern hemisphere it is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in subtropics; in the summer months, temperature usually exceeds 30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperature rarely gets cold, but wind and humidity combine and therefore feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no separate "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the rainfall is nearly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals have become accustomed to the presence of humans, the animals are still wild and need not feed or be disturbed.
The park authorities are asking for at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all the other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful they look, the bison, elk, deer, bears and almost all the beasts are capable of attacking.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept themselves at an adequate distance. As these animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, guard their space.
In addition, be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, and therefore avoid carrying or cooking scented foods and keep the camping clean.
The city of Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and only about 40,000 people live in it.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships, except one British cruiser, were sunk. About 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting at the city led to the killing of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches thanks to its location between two ports. The most popular are in three regions.
The beaches of Noth Shore (in the Northhaven district) are off the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most have a shade of pohutukava trees.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are at Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches where shops line abundantly along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One. It is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many drinkable wines from France, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may come in better.
It is quite safe to drink the local tap water, but bottled water is easy to find if you have any concerns.
To Australians the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign. Espresso is "short black", cappuccino is wearing a lot of cream (not foam) and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate conforms to the standards of Belgium. Juices are expensive but excellent.
Throughout the year many excursions to the reef and injured for any of these causes are rare.
Follow the advice of the authorities, follow all the signals and pay close attention to security warnings.
cuboses appear near beaches and estuaries, from October to April, north of 1770.
Sharks do, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and they swim away from them.
Sea crocodiles do not live in the sea. Their main habitat is estuaries north of Rockhampton.
An early reservation gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a dormitory upon arriving at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, but you may be able to book via such agents in different types of accommodations, such as campsites.
Travel agents generally make plans, which include breakfast, a transportation arrangement to access and exit the airport, or even combined plans with flights and hotels.
They may also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or provide you with other documents for the destination location (for example a visa).
All changes or requests must be directed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, most of the attendees decide to camp on the spot and the majority consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the issue, you'll have to enter early to take a tentative place next to the music.
Remember that music on the main scenes may have stopped, but there may be parts of the festival where it will be sounding continuously until late at night.
Some festivals provide special campgrounds to families with small children.
If you're going to swim north Baltic in winter, take care of the location of the cabin, as going through ice causes quite a horrendous noise in those most affected.
Pleasure ships to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Passengers from pleasure ships are free on a visa (check the conditions).
Casinos normally strive to make the guests spend the maximum of their time and money. Windows and clocks are usually not and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special foods, drinks and entertainments to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them inside.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages free of charge, but drunkenness impairs mental ability and every good gambler is aware of how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who drives a vehicle at high latitudes or across mountain passes should be aware that there may be snow, ice or frost.
On roads with ice or snow, friction is low and therefore one cannot travel as if on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, the amount of snow that can block you can fall very quickly.
Visibility can also limit snow falling or windy, here condensation, here ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, freezing and snowy weather is normal in many countries, but traffic flows largely uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safaria is perhaps the most attractive thing for tourists in Africa and that's most prominent for many visitors.
The word "safari" is popularly used with a meaning of terrestrial travel to view the amazing African fauna, especially in savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and ordinary tools provide good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards sometimes turn out to be shy, so binoculars will help you see them better.
Pedestrian safari (also called "field march", "marsh safari", or "walking") consists of marching, whether for a few hours, or for several days.
Paralympics will be held between August 24 and September 5, 2021.
After hosting the games in 1964, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to host two summer Olympics.
If you have booked the flights and accommodations for 2020, before the delay was announced, you are probably in a complicated situation.
Policies of cancellation are varied, but, with regards to late March, the majority of cancellation policies based on coronavirus do not extend until July 2020, for when the Olympics were scheduled.
Tickets for most of the events are expected to cost from 2500 to 130,000 yen, and typical tickets will cost around 7000 yen.
Glading moist clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have loanable ironing tools and ironing boards, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or if one does not want to wear ironed socks, one might try using a dryer if it is available.
Be aware that the fabric doesn't get too hot (which can shrink it or, in extreme cases, cause damage to it).
There are different ways to purge water, but some are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, enough boiling water for one minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters have different efficiencies and, if you care about that, consider then buying the water in a sealed bottle from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter animal pests, which are unknown in their home areas.
Pestilence can damage food, cause irritation or, worst of all, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons, or transport infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals capable of harming or killing a person by force, are generally not counted as pests.
Duty-free buying is the option to buy goods exempted from taxes and excise taxes in certain areas.
Travellers to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially at products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont depicts the most challenging steering conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, sometimes passing through isolated forest areas.
If you're not used to driving through rural roads, be very careful: most are in steep slopes, narrow corridors and curved girths.
Signal speed limits are remarkably lower than those of previous and subsequent sections – often 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h) – and they are strictly to be obeyed, even more than otherwise.
It is notable that mobile phone service is however much stronger here than in many other sections of the road, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very tasty and in Bavaria they are very rich and different, like those of the neighbour in the south, Austria.
There are many fruit pastries that contain apples all year round, here are cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Popular pastries usually harmonize especially well with a cup of intense coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, taste those that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen along the region.
A curry is a food consisting of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Care can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually added to curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
With 17,000 eligible islands, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines across the country.
Used without additional zoning words, the term generally means the cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now readily available throughout the island group, Javanese cuisine offers various spiced foods, with the flavors preferred by Javanese, that are peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various scented spices.
Hanging from either side of the saddle, stirrups act as props at the rider's feet.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can pose security problems, as the rider's feet could eventually get caught in them.
If, on horseback, one falls by a horse's foot caught by a stirrup, one could be dragged by a possibly running horse. In order to lessen this risk, it is possible to make various security arrangements.
First, the majority of riders wear riding boots with heel and soles smooth and rather narrow.
Additionally, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety sticks that a falling rider can pull back to detach a footing strap from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley: the most important location for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various granite walls and boulders.

Downward winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which one glides down on snow-covered terrain by having skis or snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many fans who are known as "skiy maniacs" and who plan entire vacations based on skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings that depict skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing is considered a sport of at least the 17th century and in 1861 Norwegians founded Australia's first pleasure ski club.
Backpack tourism through skis: This activity is also called field ski, ski travel or ski hiking.
It refers to alpine-style ski migration or mountaineering, but it usually does not imply them, as these latter occur on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as if it were a migration route.
Under good conditions you will be able to cross distances a little larger than when walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in runways.
Europe is a relatively small part of the world, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, to travel across several countries one needs to once again perform visa applications and passport checks.
However, the area is still functioning as if it were a single country.
As long as you stay within this area, you can generally cross borders without having to cross passport checkpoints.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply separately for a visa to every Schengen country, which saves you time, money and bureaucracies.
There is no universal definition of what goods are antiquities. Some tax agencies count as antiquities goods such as are over 100 years old.
As the definition changes locally, in places like North America an age limit might be smaller than in Europe.
Crafts could be calculated as antiques, although they are newer than similar goods mass-produced.
Breeding of reindeer is an important livelihood between the Sami and the culture surrounding their trade is also important to many other artisans.
Even in tradition, not all Sami however engaged in large-scale breeding of reindeer, but they lived out of fishing, hunting or something similar, using reindeer mostly as working animals.
Nowadays many Sami people are working in modern jobs. Tourism offers significant revenues to Sami, the Sami region.

If a travel warning is declared against the visiting country, this may affect your travel health insurance coverage or your insurance against cancellation of travel.
It is also a good idea to consult the advice of foreign governments, although they are directed to their own citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East could face situations different to those hitting Europeans or Arabs.
A warning is just a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and too simple compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing harm, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and it consists of various types that depend on the location, terrain and the atmospheric conditions.
Windstorms, hailstorms, excessive precipitation and forest fires are presentations and effects of severe weather, in addition to thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal phenomena of severe weather are blizards, blizards, winter storms and sand storms.
It is highly advisable for travelers to pay attention to any type of risk of severe weather that affects their area as this can affect any travel plans.
Any visitor to a country that could be counted as a war zone should receive professional training.
An online search for a course for hostile environments will most likely show the address of a local company.
A course will generally cover much more in detail all the issues presented here, normally with practical experience.
One course will normally take 2 to 5 days and include enactment, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines about survival in wilderness, but there are few such works on war zones.
Travelers who are planning a sex-change operation abroad should make sure they are carrying valid documents for the return.
The willingness to deliver passports without an indicated genus (X) or updated documents corresponding to a desired name varies from government to government.
Whether foreign governments are willing to accept such documents, it is equally tremendously different.
Investigations into security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the period subsequent to September 11, 2001.
Non-operative transgender people should not expect to pass through the scanners without their privacy and dignity being unaffected.
A surf is a retrograde stream of waves broken at a beach, often at a reef or similar location.
Because of the underwater divergent formations, the backflow concentrates in a few deeper sections, where a rapid flow can arise to the depth.
Most deaths occur as a result of having been tried to swim upstream, which may be impossible.
As soon as you swim out of the current, return swimming is not more difficult than normal.
Try to target a place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your abilities or on whether you've been noticed, maybe you'd rather wait until you've been saved.
The return shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture, sometimes have a particular difficulty remastering to their native culture.
Returning home after you lived abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some habits of the native culture.
When traveling abroad for the first time, people must have had patience and understanding, for they realized that travelers needed to accommodate themselves to the new country.
People can't predict that patience and understanding are also needed in relation to the travelers returning home.
The pyramidal spectacle of sound and light is one of the most interesting children's affairs in the region.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the start of the show.
Here you will generally hear the sound of tourists and sellers. The sound and light are just like a novel.
The sphinx is placed on the background and it is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes on the pyramids are projected and illuminated by the various pyramids.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by some countries and they have the most bases, sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The widest island is King George, on which is the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, whose flooded cauldron of a still active volcano provides a conspicuous natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the sea of Bellingshausen.
United with the plateau here, the peninsula's range then reappears forming the Ellsworth Range, which is 360 kilometers long and is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, the highest peak of which is 4892 m high.
In remote locations without access to a mobile phone network, a satellite phone may be the only means.
A satellite phone generally is not a replacement for a mobile phone, as one must be on the outside at a clear view of a satellite to make a phone call.
The service often uses ships, including those pleasant, as well as expeditions that have needs for remote data and voice.
Your local phone service provider could additionally inform you about the connection to this service.
For those who plan a Saturday year, it is increasingly popular to travel and study.
This is particularly popular among those who finish middle school because it gives them a free year before going to university without risking their education.
In many cases, if you join a Saturday-year course in a foreign country, this can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education when you have returned to the home country.
There will normally be a registration fee to join these educational programs.
Finland is a great travel destination for boating. The "Country of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the offshore archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and on the lakes there is no need for a yacht.
Despite the fact that the offshore archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even kayak provide other experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland: one of all seven or eight Finns owns a boat.
Such popularity is only seen in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. But besides, it is a fairly unique statics (e.g., one out of every forty people has a boat).
Most of the various Baltic cruise ships also include a stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can fully use a few days to visit the historic city, returning at night on the ship to sleep there.
If you're only travelling by boat, you don't need a visa (since 2009).
Some cruise ships' brochures include Berlin, in Germany. As seen above on the map, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by air can be a frightening experience no matter age and descent, especially if one has never flown or if one has experienced a traumatic experience.
This is not a humiliating thing: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes otherwise that many people feel.
For some people, understanding how a plane works, and what happens during flight, can help overcome fear that is based on not being known or controlled the things.
Courier companies get good money for fast delivery of items. Often time is very important for business documents, goods or replacement pieces for emergency repair.
In some lines, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but there has been a problem in other lines and small companies.
If they sent things by freighted plane, in some routes could spend a few days in the execution of discharge and customs.
The only way to do this was to send things like registered packages. Under airline regulations, you can't send a package without a related passenger, and here you catch the opportunity.
The most obvious way to fly in the first or business class is to spend a very thick banknote package for the privilege (or, even better, your company do it instead of you).
However, this is not cheap: according to gross estimate, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual savings class rate for the business class and eleven times for the first class!
In general, it is not worth the effort to seek discounts for seats from business or first class for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of fliers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably, and they are levying in accordance with this.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinevo. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic having suffered ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of a self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which no UN member state recognizes.
The economic ties were resumed between these two parts of Moldova, although political negotiations failed.
The most important religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.
Having once been the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and vibrant commercial centre, located at a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Among the broad boulevards, the buildings with glass facades and the modern shopping centres, are spread out to be traditional roofs of red tiles, 18th-century bazaars and old mosques and churches, but the city's atmosphere is more of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.

Please behave in the place with as much dignity, solemnity and respect as it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not damage the location with marks or graphites on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. More than half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most posts are only in Catalan, as the law declared it the first official language.
Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other services.
In the metro, regular announcements are made only in Catalan, but unscheduled interruptions are announced using an automatic system in multiple languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Residents of Paris have gained a reputation of egocentric, unfriendly and proud people.

The Plitvic Lakes National Park has abundant forests, mainly of beeches, spruces and firs, and it presents a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The diversity of vegetarian communities is remarkably high due to the range of microclimates, diverse terrains and different elevations.

Here rare fauna can be found, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats and urogals, in addition to many more common species.
During a visit to the monasteries, women must wear knee-length skirts and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries do make provision for women who have arrived unprepared, but the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you if you bring your own linen, especially if it is lightly coloured.
Men should wear long pants.
This can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance, but you don't wash those clothes after each use, and therefore you may not feel comfortable if you wear these skirts.
Majorca cuisine, like those of similar Mediterranean regions, has a base for bread, vegetables and meat (especially from pig) and it uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomato and any available additive, like cheese, tuna etc.
Every noun, in addition to the word Sie meaning you, always starts capitally, even in the middle of a sentence.

However, people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so close that it is not worth learning it separately.
In general, pre-modern observatories are today out-of-date and they remain as museums or education sites.
Since then light pollution was not such a problem as it is today, they are generally located in cities or at universities, places more easily accessible than those where the built in modern times are.
The most modern telescopes for research are enormous facilities in remote areas under favorable atmospheric conditions.
A look at cherry blossoms, aka hanami, has been part of the culture of Japan since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossom was the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the Emperor only for himself and other aristocrats around the imperial court.

Non-believers living in Christian countries or elsewhere around the world have adopted many of the traditions about this festival.
It is customary to spend the evening in an outdoor setting to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could be a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
On the Saturday night of Easter weekend, more traditional churches often hold a Easter vigil and the congregations begin to celebrate just at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived at the island came either by swimming, or by flying, or by floating.
Due to the long distance between the islands and the mainland, mammals could not make such a journey and therefore the giant tortoise became the chief grazing animal on the Galápagos Islands.
Since its arrival, humans have introduced many mammals to the Galápagos Islands, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience a polar night, that is, the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good chance to see the boreal vibe, because the sky will be dark almost always.
You will also be able to enjoy the stars as these regions are thinly inhabited and therefore light pollution is usually not a problem.
Japanese labor culture is more hierarchical and formal than such, to which Westerners may be accustomed.
Costumes are the normal work clothes and co-workers address each other by family names or job titles.
Workplace harmony is paramount, as is the emphasis on group effort rather than the praise of individual achievements.
Workers usually have to receive the approval of their superiors for all decisions made and they must obey the instructions indiscriminately.
