Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they are “like Muppets”
Some members of the Assembly are appalled at the proposal to be called MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament) now.
This was due to plans to change the name of the congregation to the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the assembly throughout the political spectrum are concerned that they will make a fool of themselves.
A member of the Labour Assembly said that they were concerned in their group, “because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid Cymru Assembly said that their group as a whole “is not satisfied” and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said that his group is an "open spirit" regarding the change of name, but also pointed out that there is a small difference between the words MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the pronunciation of the "u" in the Yorkshire dialect.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing draft legislation to present changes to the name, stated: "At last, the decision on possible descriptors for the members of the Assembly will, of course, have to be taken by the members themselves."
The Welsh Assembly was authorised by the Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
The Commission has chosen the name "Welsh Parliament Member" or "WMP" as members of the Assembly, but in the public consultation, the most support was given to "MWP".
Members of the Assembly are obviously proposing alternatives, but reaching consensus will be a difficult task for President-in-Office Elin Jones, who has to submit draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the incompatibility of the performance of the duties of members of the Assembly and the establishment of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will take part in the final vote on their designation in the debate on legislation.
Macedonians will decide by referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday the voters will vote whether or not they will change the name of their country to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
By voting, they want to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, adversaries to the plebiscite on the change of name, said that he would ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is simply the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin’s Church have been silent, as the churches in Harlem face difficulties
“The older people I talked to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” said Adams.
»There is neither today.«
He explained that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"People hang out differently today.
Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhoods where people regularly go.«
In the churches, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect and will soon be back at the beginning.
He added that churches could be replaced with residential buildings with a common administration (condominium) where people would live who would not help the shelters in the neighborhood that remained.
“The vast majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and that is why the day will soon come when all these churches will close, because it is unlikely that people who will move to these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white methodist church community moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community who performed worship in the vicinity.
St. Martin’s took over a black religious community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of salesmen who refused to recruit or support blacks on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem.
The fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild, they ordered chime bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the bells “bells for poor people”.
The expert who knocked in July named them a little differently: “cultural treasure” and “insurmountable historical instrument”.
The expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first chime bells played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he knocked on bigger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said that he was not replaced in St. Martin’s church.
The church of St. Martin’s has had a complicated story with architects and contractors in the last few months; some have been brought by church laity and others by diocese.
In July, the sacristy – the administrative body of the parish consisting of laymen – wrote to the diocese that she was concerned that the diocese would “try to pass on the costs” to the parish, although the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the diocese.
Shark hurt a 13-year-old lobster catcher in California
Officials report that on Saturday in California, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old while hunting lobsters at the opening of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning, he was diving with his friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then he swam to him with a group and helped him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just excited about catching the lobster, and then he realized that he was screaming, "He bit me!
He bit me!"
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed that his collarbone was torn.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: “There is a shark in the water!” he added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The lifeguard, Cap. Larry Giles, in a press release, said that a few weeks earlier a shark was observed in the area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe damage to the upper torso.
For 48 hours, those responsible blocked access from Ponto Beach Beach in Casablad to Swami’s Beach in Ecinitas for investigation and security.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s planning to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty corners as they have in department stores, and with professional staff.
As part of its entry to the British beauty market, worth GBP 2.8 billion and still growing, while the sale of clothing and household appliances is declining, larger beauty spots will be tested in 11 shops across the country and in more shops next year if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves they used to use for TVs, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s says that they will double the offer of their beauty products to 3,000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw for the first time.
The existing offer of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also gain more space in branded areas similar to those in shops such as Boots.
Supermarket also revitalizes its boutique range of cosmetic products, so most products are vegan – something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will try the concession in two Sainsbury’s stores. The first one opened last week in Croydon, South London, while the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, by the end of the year.
The online shopping and daily shopping of small quantities of food in local stores require greater efforts by supermarkets to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, Executive Director at Sainsbury’s, said that retail stores would be similar to supermarkets, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight the discounts of Aldi and Lidl with several services and non-food products.
The Sainsbury’s group opened outlette Argos in hundreds of shops and also Habitat since it bought both chains two years ago, which increased food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempts by the supermarket to renovate its departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products have ended in failure.
Sainsbury’s undertaken a joint venture with the Boots chain at the beginning of the 21st century, but the relationship ended after the dispute over the distribution of profits from drugstores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s three years ago sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 shops to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million.
They stated that Lloyds would play a role in this plan as they would expand the range of luxury skin care brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We changed the appearance and impression of our beauty corners to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available for advice.
Our brand offer is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination, which is a challenge for the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones "freaky" because Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million deal.
The star of Dragons Den (Good Business) is furious that TV anchor Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a business worth £11 million with his brand of lifestyle to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of clothing and accessories, Truly.
The company was compared with the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The head of this show, this Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she's retreating.
Holly Willoughby pissed off the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones because she had recently withdrawn from their lucrative lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “excited” when, on Tuesday, during a tense meeting at his company's headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, he admitted that due to his new business — worth up to £1.5 million — he did not have enough time to devote himself to their brand of clothing and accessories to Truly.
The company compared it with the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and predicted that it would double its assets estimated at GBP 11 million.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source states: »Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
It would be her long-term future to support herself for the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw was completely astonished by all those involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was happening because the opening was so close.
At the headquarters of the company in Marlowe there is a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the leader of this Morning, one of the most interesting connections for banks in Britain, would cost the company millions due to large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
Moreover, this can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly along with Cappova in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The pair shared a holiday together, and Jones has a 40 % stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV I’m A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business matters.”
Hard talk »and then we fell in love«
He was joking about the criticisms of the media due to a comment that some people find to be "non-presidential" and a positive opinion about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in like that?
Trump, with his mocking “newsman” voice, said:
»I didn’t give in to anything.«
He pointed out that Kim showed interest in the second meeting, and his first meeting in Singapore in June marked Trump as a major step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly meeting that North Korea did not see the "appropriate response" of the US to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He pointed out that instead, the US continued to impose sanctions that continued to exert pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his address.
“We are doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship.”
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had brought positive results — they stopped the rocket testing, helped free the hostages, and brought home the remains of the American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in discussing relations with Kim.
“It is very easy to be President-in-Office, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded scene, we have 200 people standing here,” said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of us.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds of dead
In addressing the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s inhabitants were resettled, they did not declare a natural disaster, which is a condition for sending international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear that they did not require international assistance, so the situation is somewhat complicated,” said Sumbung.
Save the Children is a team that will travel to Pal, but it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel will be able to help on the ground.
Sutopu, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu and were finding out whether they would allow international agencies to help.
Since earthquakes in Indonesia are constant, the country remains completely unprepared for the rage of nature.
Although shelters were built in Aceh after the tsunami, this is not common practice on other shores.
The apparent absence of warning sirens for the Palu tsunami may have contributed to the loss of lives, even though there was a warning.
Traveling among many Indonesian islands is a challenge even in the best times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the victims of an earthquake is headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days for it to arrive at the site of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put the improvement of the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure at the forefront of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit is a problem for the Joko administration when re-elected next year.
Joko also faces the pressure of prolonged tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of religion.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge won a late tie against Chelsea
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the 1st English League in 89 minutes.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri over 25 meters from Chelsea's goal at the back of his 1-0 team.
He took the ball to his left and fired a shot at a remote gate.
The shot traveled high above the penalty room towards the right upper corner of the door.
In the end, the ball fell over Kep’s goalkeeper, Arrizabalage, and fell into the goal.
“I just tried to get to the right position for the ball and players like Shaq always pull it as far forward as they can, so I just tried to buy as much time as possible,” said Sturridge for LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch, I didn’t think much anymore and simply decided to shoot.”
Chelsea ran a 1-0 at halftime with a Belgian player named Eden Hazard hit in 25 minutes.
In this action, the Blue Attacker gave the ball back to Mateu Kovačić with his heel and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kovačić quickly passed in the middle and ran forward.
Then he passed beautifully through the defense, and Hazard ran into the penitentiary.
Hazard beat the defense and shot his left foot at a remote gate through Liverpool's doorman, Alsson Becker.
Liverpool will meet Napoli in the team section of the Champions League at 15.00 on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea is waiting in London on Thursday at 3:00, Videoton, Europe League.
The number of deaths of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The number of deaths of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has risen to 832, reported by the National Accident Agency on Sunday morning.
A representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told the press conference that due to the 7.5 earthquake on Friday, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings.
Palu, who has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
Police launched a murder investigation after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old with stab wounds was found at 7:55 in the Grayson Mews building on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of murder.
The police are calling all those who have been in the area and have seen or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its early stages, but I appeal to everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on the car cam footage, to contact us, as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A representative of the police confirmed that the woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the crime scene who thought they knew the woman and asked where she was found this morning.
Investigations are under way, and the police inform the families of the women.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
When he found out what happened, he was speechless.
The residents have now been told that it could take hours before they can re-enter.
The police heard him explain to the man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
He keeps saying, "That's so terrible."
At 2:00, there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another one right outside.
Many policemen stood inside the cordon and watched the apartment building.
All who have any information are asked to write to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimetoppers at 0800 555 111, giving a diary of 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament has become the most recent memorial target of the conflict on "rewriting history"
His removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical followers of puritanism.
But Cromwell Society has labeled Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: "In today's debate on the removal of statues, it became clear that Oliver Cromwell's image outside the Westminster Palace will become a target."
The Iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars of Cromwell did not order or execute.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor of the last century.
The splendid presentation by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell demonstrates the 19th - century opinion and is part of historiography for a personality that some think is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: "Many (perhaps even more in the late 19th century than today) see Cromwell as a protector of parliament from external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a purely accurate performance is the subject of constant historical debates.
It is clear that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual who represents one side of this division.
His achievements from the time he was Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered.”
A killer pig mauled a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in Southwest China.
A man, identified only by his surname “Yuan”, was found dead with a cut artery and covered in blood near a pigsty at a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, on Sunday, reported to the South China Morning Post newspaper.
A pig farmer is preparing for vaccination at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
On Wednesday, she and her cousin were reportedly traveling from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door to the next pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pigsty with a bloody mouth.
Forensics confirmed that a 500-pound pig mauled a farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” quoted his cousin with his last name “Wu” in Guiyaang Evening News.
The security footage showed that Yuang came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan wasn't his or his cousin's.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been arrested so he wouldn't attack anyone while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders were to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where the man suffered severe bodily injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig squeezed a Welsh farmer against a tractor, but then his wife drove the animal away.
After the pigs ate a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “starter”.
»We just want to play.
They're like little kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
All they need to do is show them enough respect," he said.
South-west of the United States, heavy rains are coming from the remains of hurricane Rosa
According to reports, Hurricane Rosa is moving towards colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico and is weakening.
However, in the next few days, Rosa will bring floods to the north of Mexico and to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa has been in Hurricane 1st category since Sunday at 5.00 a.m. Eastern time at a wind speed of 137 km/h and is located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, the low pressure area is being strengthened, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States, and Rosa will approach the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, pushing high tropical moisture northwards to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimetres of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture, which will blend in with the low-pressure area, will create heavy rainfall in the next few days in the wider southwest area.
Locally, between 25 and 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, rain deposits and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Due to high tropical moisture, precipitation in some places will approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-western parts, above most of Arizona, rain is expected to be between 50 and 100 mm.
Floods are possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be very reckless to walk into the desert when tropical rains are at risk.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, and storms will bring local gusts of wind and dust in the air.
The approaching low pressure area will bring local rains to parts of the coast of South California.
Precipitations above 12 mm are possible, which can lead to reduced deposition of debris and slippery roads.
This will be the first rains for the region during the rainy season.
A few scattered tropical plates will begin approaching Arizona on Saturday late afternoon and Monday early morning, and late Monday and Tuesday the rainfall will spread.
Heavy rains will spread to all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will also last on Wednesday.
In October, major temperature fluctuations can occur in the United States, as the Arctic cools down and tropical regions remain rather warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperatures over short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of the dramatic difference in temperature in the central part of the United States.
Between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is 20 degrees apart.
Over the next few days, summer temperatures will try to stabilize and expand again.
Most of the Central and Eastern United States will enter warm October with temperatures around 27 °C from Southern Plain to parts of the northeast.
In New York on Tuesday, we could have 27 degrees, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a good chance of temperatures above the US average in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation.
Over 20 million people on six television networks have seen the interesting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, as TV stations interrupted the regular program due to the last minute turn of Friday: an agreement forged by Arizona's Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh was in a drunk state and tried to take it off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a heated testimony that he was 100% convinced that this did not happen.
Nielsen reports that more than 20.4 million people are expected to see the testimony on Friday.
The company was considered to have average TV coverage of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast testimony, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network networks.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems counting viewers who watch the program in the offices.
To facilitate the performance, the ratings are similar to that of playing the football game of the playoffs or the award ceremony of the American Film Academy.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, leads the whole day’s hearing in front of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's play.
After the moderate Republican office made a statement to vote in favour of Kavanough, on Friday morning, television cameras CNN and CBS recorded protestors screaming at him trying to get into the elevator in order to attend a hearing of the Justice Committee.
During the reproof, he lowered his view for a few minutes, which was captured live by CNN’s television cameras.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said a woman.
»You think he's telling the truth to the state?
You have power, while many women are helpless.”
Flake said that his office had made a statement and added that he would say more at the committee hearing, and then the elevator door closed.
All television networks broadcast live hours later, when the Justice Committee voted on the surrender of Kavanaugh's appointment to vote in the Senate.
But Flake said that he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate charges against a candidate in the next week, as called for by the minority party of Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced to talk to his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decisive because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "games of political games" at Brexit
In an interview for the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with a British future and undermining national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Theresa May at the Conservatory Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson escalated his attack on her so-called Brexit plan from Chequers and said that the suggestion that Britain and the EU pay customs to each other was “all absurd.”
Shots fired at Wayde Sims: police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of LSU teammate's death.
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU team basketball player.
According to the Baron Rouge police report, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for charge of second-degree murder.
Officials have released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police have indicated that he lost his sunglasses during the fight Sims.
The police found sunglasses on the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, the CBS TV complements WAFB TV reports.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police made a statement that he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
Bail is $350,000, reports a lawyer.
An East Baton Rouge Parish coroner issued a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police thank you for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest of the Special Unit for the fugitives of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Police of the Southern University and the residents of the area.
The sports director of the LSU Joe Alleva team thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their "care and search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-inch attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU Will Wade team said that the team was "stressed" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
»That's what you worry about all the time,« Wade said.
Volcano puking ashes on Mexico City
The ash erupted by the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern neighbourhood of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The Center observed several cases of thunder and earthquake shocks.
Photos on social networks showed thin layers of ash that covered car windscreens in the neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico City, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics have observed an increased activity in a volcano situated 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, after an earthquake of 7.1 degrees in September 2017 overthrew central Mexico.
Volcano, called "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after fighting anti-violent police forces and thousands of people joined the rival demonstrations that marked the first anniversary of the Catalan polarised vote on secession.
A group of masked supporters of separatism, held up by anti-riot police forces, threw eggs at them and threw paint in the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there were also fights, and police officers had to use batons to stop conflicts.
The supporters of independence, who shouted for hours 'no forgetfulness, no forgiveness', faced protestors who supported unity and shouted 'Live Spain!'.
According to the local media, fourteen people have suffered minor injuries in protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which was labeled illegal in Madrid and celebrated by Catalan Separators, tensions remain in the region supporting independence.
The vast majority of voters voted in favour of independence, although participation was low, as the opponents of secession boycotted the elections to a large extent.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop the continued vote in the region's polling stations in violent conflicts.
Groups supporting independence camped overnight in front of the polls to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take another path.
The 68-year-old Narcissus Termes, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had the hope that Catalonia would become independent.
»Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite important, although close, victories in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties supporting independence have this year found it difficult to maintain the initiative, as many of the best-known leaders are in voluntary exile or are awaiting trial in detention for their role in organising a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to record a protest in support of the police, explained that the protest was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is intensifying,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been in custody since the end of last year before the trial began, announced that he would stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
“Candidating in the European elections is the best way to condemn regression in democratic values and repression that we have seen in the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men who hit the house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested for repeatedly bumping into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7.30 p.m. British Summer Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door and the building were damaged.
At some point, they were supposed to shoot the car with a crossbow.
With the Mengaj hit, Livingston won 1:0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingston guaranteed victory
Livingston was astonished by the Rangers and Steven Gerrard only had to admit his second defeat in 18 matches as coach of the club from Ibrox.
Dolly Mengaj's shot made the difference, as Gary Holt's team matched the Hibernian team in second place.
Gerrard's team has thus lost their winnings in this year's championship, and next Sunday, Hearts is waiting for them, who are on the ranking and who are behind by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased his undefeated streak in the division to six matches, and Chief Coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miler last month, has not yet experienced defeat.
Livingston wasted its chances against direct guests
Holt's team should have been in charge long before the hit, as they caused a lot of problems with Rangers' directness.
Scott Robinson made the break, but he sent the ball over the door frame, then Alan Lithgow hit the doorpost, and Craig Halkett fired his head over the goal.
The hosts left the game to the Rangers because they knew that they could be dangerous to the guests when they interrupted the attack.
And that's how they got to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up an action for Mengaj, who shot and hit from the middle of the penitentiary.
The Rangers had a bigger possession of the ball, but they couldn't break through the domestic defenses, and the goalie Liam Kelly wasn't very busy.
This pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's defense.
The Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor took his foot to defend Scott Pittman's shot, and Lithgow fired from another Livingston break in the attack past the goal.
Prepositions continued to come to Livingston's penitentiary, but homeowners refused all attacks, two offenses – Halket's offense against Glenn Middleton's replacement, and the misdemeanor for hand-playing – but the judge failed.
"Excellent performance" Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Maèrena Stadium
Great show and score for Livingston.
All of them were excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this path up.
The style of the game and the figure have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt should be credited with the way he woke up the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role, and he had a very well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Wormall on standby at all times.
The Rangers, however, simply lacked inspiration.
Although they are exceptional under the leadership of Gerrard, they are greatly lacking in these standards.
There was a lack of shots to the goal – only once they successfully defeated the host defence – and this is some kind of wake-up call for the Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the scale.
Erdogana was accepted in Cologne in a mixed way
On Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO's allies.
There have been conflicts over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkish accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne for the opening of a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police stopped 25,000 heads from gathering from the mosque, but many supporters managed to get closer to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors have also expressed their views, including many Kurds – who do not support the Erdogan government and condemn Erdogan's policy and the German Government's decision to welcome it in the country.
Opposing protests reflect the difference between a visitor who some German Turks praise as a hero and others despise as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: The cyclist crashed in a car accident.
In London, the cyclist died in a car crash.
The accident occurred near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a road in Deptford, southeast of the city at approximately 10:15 a.m. British summer time.
The driver stopped and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred just a few months after the cyclist died in a collision where the car driver escaped on Childers Street, about a mile [1.5 km] from the crash on Saturday.
The police have made a statement that the police are checking the identity of the man so that they can notify their families.
Road blocks were set up, bus lines were diverted, and motorcyclists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in a riot
Six prison guards were injured in a riot in a heavily guarded man's prison, reported from the prison management.
The riot broke out at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at approximately 9.30 a.m. British summer time and is still ongoing.
Police officers from the Tornado unit were called to take care of a riot involving eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
The guards were treated with minor facial injuries on the spot.
A representative of the prison staff said: "We have called specially trained personnel to deal with the HMP Long Lartin prison riot.
Six of the staff suffered injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be taken away by the police and may therefore be further behind bars.”
There are over 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, an anti-disaster police force was called to prison to intervene in a serious riot in which staff were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Pheonix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be beneficial for drought zones)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but that is what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, since the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa is paving its way through the southwest of the desert, bringing danger of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa's supposed to be pissed off at Phoenix on Tuesday, and he'll be getting close by late Monday with the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix stated in the tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression within 300 kilometres of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) raged over 60 kilometers from the Arizona border.«
The latest models of the National Centre for Hurricane are forecasting precipitation of between 50 and 100 mm with individual precipitations of up to 150 mm per Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin areas, it is expected to be between 25 and 50 mm of precipitation, with possible individual precipitations up to 100 mm.
For areas outside the threat of sudden floods, the rain of Hurricane Rosa may be a real blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as it is currently taking a dry period in the southwest.
“At least, according to the U.S. Sushi Tracking Center, over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought,” reports Weather.com.
The path of Hurricane Rosa first leads to the mainland of the Mexican peninsula Baja California.
Rosa, who still has hurricane power on Sunday morning at the highest wind speed of 130 miles per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 19 km per hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and weakens.
The land in Mexico is expected to reach by the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Precipitations in parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a high risk of flooding.
“From the Baja California peninsula to the northwest of Sonora, we expect 75 to 150 mm of precipitation with a possibility of 250 mm of precipitation,” reported weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and towards southern Utah until late night on Tuesday.
“The biggest threat we expect from hurricane Rosa or its remains is the heavy rains on the Baja Califonia peninsula in the northwest of Sonora and in the US southwest desert,” said the National Centre for Hurricane.
These precipitations can lead to life - threatening sudden floods and floods in deserts and landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder.
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds found in Somerset.
A wounded teenager was found in Excelsion Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 a.m. British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, and his condition remains “stable”.
17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, reports Avon and Somerset police.
Police are calling on anyone who may have picked up a cell phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “suffered unkindness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The voice to Judge Kavanaugh is the voice against the ruthlessness and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” said Trump at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “suffered unkindness and anger” of the Democratic Party in the process of its appointment.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in front of the convention, denying clearly and emotionally the charges of Christine Blasey Ford sexually assaulting her decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford also testified to her allegations.
On Saturday, the president said that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage".
“The vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to appoint one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican election participation in the interim elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm really working on my candidacy," he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting everywhere for excellent candidates.”
Trump claims that the Democrats are on a mission of "trust and obstruction".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment was scheduled to take place no later than Friday, said CNN's advisor to the Republican Party.
Hundreds of people killed in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, the number of victims rising
On Saturday, authorities reported that at least 384 people died in the earthquake and tsunami that struck the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, and many of them carried huge waves that hit the coast.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Palo on Friday, when the waves hit the beach at dusk and carried many to their death and destroyed everyone on their journey.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a power of 7.5 degrees.
»When the danger of the tsunami arose yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims,« said a representative of the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Mitigation BNB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he dragged cars, trees, houses, everything to the ground," explained Nugroho, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He said that some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the accident agency show destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and demolished bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A range of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) stated in its statement that the energy released in the Friday strong earthquake is about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb power in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of the long and narrow bay, is expected to increase the size of the tsunami.
He described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
He also said that the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the buildings, and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and injuries may be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the Donggal area, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
As Nugroho also said, communications are completely interrupted and have no information from the Donggal area.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the area,” said the Red Cross statement, adding that staff and volunteers are going to the affected areas.
»This is a tragedy, but it can get worse,« they said.
On Saturday, the agency received numerous criticisms because it did not inform the public that the tsunami had hit Pal, but officials say that the waves came at the time of the warning.
On an amateur video published on social media, a man on the upper floor screams warning people on the street on the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collided along the coast and took the buildings and cars with it.
Reuters couldn't confirm the authenticity of the tape immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power failure that cut off communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Authorities report that the military has begun sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other basic necessities of life.
The city airport was only open to provide aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims in the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Dpeča, members of the World Vision from Donggala arrived safely in Palo, where employees in the courtyard set up a shelter from the tarpaulins in front of their premises, but on the way they saw numerous scenes of devastation.
»They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,« he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief teams launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with great experience were not allowed to arrive in Palu.
In accordance with the Indonesian regulations, overseas financing, stocks and assistance of personnel are only permitted if the accident site is declared a national disaster area.
This has never happened before.
“It is still considered an accident at the province level,” said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, “OK, this is a national disaster”, we can accept international aid, but this is not yet the status.”
The second night after Friday’s earthquake and the tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of missing persons cling to the hope that their near miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
A boy was pulled out of the sewers on Saturday.
On Sunday, the paramedics released a woman who was trapped under the ruins for two days, and her mother's body was lying next to her.
Gendon Subandon, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were, according to Mr. Mandagi, his students.
“As an age in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon remembers how in the hours when the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was circulating in the paragliding community, she was desperate to send messages to whatsApp to the contestants in Palu who attended the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one grey hook instead of two blue ones.
“I think this means that messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while charging an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to the Newport police, on Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from Brink’s Security Service, which filled an ATM in Newport on the Leeve.
The driver of the car was emptying the ATM at the amusement complex and preparing for the delivery of the money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a press release.
While he was busy, another man “nearly approached the Brink’s employee’s security service” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
According to reports, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate the exact number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information on suspects' identities should call Newport PD at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name – to Ye.
The change was announced on Saturday on Twitter and wrote: »A creature with the official name Kanye West«.
The name Ye has been used for some time by 41-year-old West for the title of his eight-year-old album, which he published in June.
The change is coming just before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace the singer Ariano grande, who canceled the performance for "personal reasons", said the filmmaker.
The word is an abbreviation of his current professional name, but West has already said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think that "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means "you" (now you)," said West at the beginning of this year, when he spoke about the title of the album with Big Boy's radio host.
»So I am you and I am all of us.
Kanye, which means "the only one", I changed to Ye – this reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are.”
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed his wish for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former colleague of West's, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with or without a dash and in capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO promises not to use an army against civilians
Newly elected Mexican President Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador swore that he would never use military force against civilians, just as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody violence against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at the Tlatelolco Plaza Square that “he would never use an army to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when left-wing student movements began operating in Latin America, soldiers began shooting and killing 300 people at peaceful demonstrations on the market on October 2, 1968.
Lopez Obrador swore to support young Mexicans and to provide students with monthly subsidies and to open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into criminal networks.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the funds it spends on research in this field, says the investor and expert on artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have announced the use of artificial intelligence, even though the US does not even have an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to be the best in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are well behind the US and are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,” said Lee.
Double funding could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the United States, Lee said about CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, president of Synovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University developed a system of artificial intelligence that defeated the highest-ranking American player in Othello, and later was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the China branch of Google.
Lee said that he was familiar with previous technological competitions of the US government, such as a robotics competition organised by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when the next one would be, to help him find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States have to work hard to get state support, says Lee.
“It’s not China that takes over the best academics, it’s the companies,” explained Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed the best from universities in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes to immigration policy could help the US to step up its efforts in the area of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that people with a doctorate in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese National Council issued a development plan for the artificial intelligence of the new generation.
The Chinese National Science Foundation finances people in academic institutions, like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations, distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is deteriorating, explained Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the creation of a Joint Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment in the AI Next initiative of USD 2 billion.
National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in artificial intelligence research
Meanwhile, the US legislation that wanted to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has done nothing for months.
Macedonians will decide to change the country's name in a referendum
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum whether they would change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia". This would resolve the decades-long conflict with Greece, which opposed their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the governments agreed on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts that participation would be at least 50 absent as long as the referendum would be valid.
The question on the referendum paper was: "Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU by agreeing with Greece?"
The supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is a price worth paying for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO, for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the break-up of Yugoslavia.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country and for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgia in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote, which will be decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Election Commission announced that no irregularities had been reported by 13.00.
However, participation was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
»I came to vote for my children, our city is in Europe,« said the 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, the electorate from the capital of Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško placed their ballots in Strumica, Macedonia for a referendum in Macedonia on a change in the name of a country that would open the way to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and setting up chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door,” said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not wish to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring a much needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” said Zaev after submitting his ballot.
He added that a positive result would be "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would have taken part in the referendum, which is less than the necessary electoral participation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian television Telma showed that 57 percent of the respondents would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to succeed, voting participation must be 50% plus one vote.
An unsuccessful referendum would have been the first serious blow to the pro-Western government policy, which took over the mandate last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has outplayed Brighton's entire defense and won
On Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense at Manchester City's 2-0 win.
Aguero's score in 65 was ridiculously simple.
At the start of the campaign, the Argentine attack received a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran between three Brigton defensive players and found an open space.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green players.
He played one defensive player and was faster than the others on the edge of Brighton's criminal space.
Then he passed Sterling to his left.
With his first touch in the penalty room, the English attacker returned the ball to Agueru, who beat Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right of the net.
“Aguero is facing problems in his legs,” told the press coach City Pep Guardiola.
“We agreed to play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment.”
But Sterling was the one who gave the blues an initial lead in the match of the first English League.
He scored the goal in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep on Brighton's half.
He passed the ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane touched the ball a few times, then sent the ball to Sterling towards the far gate.
The blue blues' attacker pushed the ball into the net just before it could fly past the goal.
On Tuesday at 12:55 p.m., City will meet with Hoffenheim at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the Rockies and ruin their chances of getting a title.
The Nationals team came out of the playoffs, so there's no special reason for another attack.
But the always competing Scherzer hopes to climb the pitcher's hill on Sunday against Colorado Rockies. This will only happen if the Rockies still have the chance to play in the playoffs, as they have a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers team in the West League.
Rockies won 5:2 on Friday over the Nationals team at least an invitation from the organizer, but they're still waiting for their first address in the division.
"Although we can't gain anything, at least we'll be able to play in an excellent atmosphere in front of the great crowd here in Denver, and the opposing team will be playing on the probably highest level this year.
So why don't you want to compete?«
The Nationals haven't released the first pitcher's name for Sunday, but he'll probably be throwing Scherzer in this case.
Scherzer, who will be the first to throw for the 34th time, was throwing as a relief player on Thursday and would have had enough rest by Sunday.
This season, the Washington right-winger won 18 wins and 7 wins with an average of 2,53 and 300 beatings in 220 2/3 of shifts this season.
Trump at conventions in West Virginia
The President indirectly touched on the situation regarding his choice for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican electoral participation in the interim elections.
“Everything we have done will be at stake in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
They will be one of the biggest – I am really working on the candidacy, so I am everywhere fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “We have this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, and that is what is happening now.
They're determined to regain power, using every means they can, and you can see the insolence, the malice.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to wander to get power and control, because that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
According to him, the democrats are on a mission of "trust and obstruction".
“And you could see it in the last four days,” he said and described the Democrats as “an angry, evil, lowly and lying”.
He highlighted by name a member of the Committee on Justice, Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein, with loud disapproval from the audience.
»Remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I'm not, wait, that was really bad body language, worst thing I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
She is impatient toward those who express her opinion.
When an activist of Momentum in my local party spoke to me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last in a series of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party who are not wanted for the sake of expressing their opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, had a similar situation because she strongly resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was about my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironicly similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement for Friday's Labour Party meeting Nottingham East said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the eight years that I am a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday's meetings were mostly exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this tone is not used in most meetings today, and the promise of a "kinder and gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if ever begun.
It is increasingly evident that different views in the Labour Party are not admissible and in any opinion it is assessed whether this is acceptable for the management of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues whom I had previously thought we shared similar political views expected me to change my opinion and take positions that I would never agree with – whether in the area of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly – and it does not really matter what I say – there are criticisms on social networks that call for non-choice, condemn the policy of the middle and tell me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are directed at me are only political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but who are not intimidated.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this political period is how abuse rates have become something quite common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour Party must promote a culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we are no longer open to differing opinions and with each proposal of censure or amendment of the selection rules, the customer becomes more narrow.
Over the last two years, I have received a lot of advice to keep my head down and not to be so loud, and I will be “all right”.
But that's why I didn't enter politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago – this was caused by the negligence of the Tatcher Government, which literally led to the collapse of the classroom in my primary school – I tried as a local councillor or government minister to promote better public services for those most in need.
I have never hidden my political beliefs, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused by my political views and areas on which I did not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to those who supported the proposal on Friday that I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy discussing my loyalty to the head of the Labour Party at a time when the country is heading towards Brexit, which will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my true message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents and voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threat of non-choice or political suitability will deter me from acting in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr to Top
Two late attempts slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this wonderfully entertaining championship match of the day.
Now they're at the top of the scale and they're the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, the scales were shifted to the home page by their superior defenses and a better exploitation of the opportunity, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
“We have been through a lot of tests in our games so far, and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to the Ayro team, they took the opportunity better than we did."
The hit by Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, led Ayr into the lead, but the yellow card for Captain Rory Hughes of Scotland, who received it in the game with the Warriors, was a numerical superiority for Melrose and Jason Baggott intercepted the attempt without conversion.
At the time of the offense, Climo increased the leadership for Ayr before he hit it at halftime and then converted the independent attempt to score 17:5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the other half very well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
A long interruption was followed by a serious injury to Ruaridha Knott, which was carried off on the stretchers, and after that, Ayr was promoted by an experiment by Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Clima.
The interim captain, Ayra Blair MacPherspon, then received the yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the game with the player over with the unconverted Bruce Colvino experiment at the end of the period of intense pressure.
But the hosts came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got his yellow card because of cluttering Clim without the ball, MacPherson scored a hit in the attack.
Climo scored points after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's shot and sent Gregor Henry's wingman into his fifth host experiment.
"Still Game Star" is starting a new career in the hospitality industry.
The star of Still Game Ford Kieran appears to be going into the catering business, as he was supposed to be the CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old in a popular BBC series, for which he also wrote a script, plays Jack Jarvis along with a long-time partner in Greg Hemphill comedy.
Two announced that after the next ninth season, Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The player refused to comment on the story, but the source suggested to Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to participate in the "flowering catering" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Sailors are patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
There are blue flags on public buildings.
The maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with a slogan: »We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to restore it to ourselves.”
In Continental Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody conflict over natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive — as is the desire for a re-entry of the Pacific Ocean.
This hope may now be greatest after decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be given to it on 1 October after five years of consultation.
“Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, in a positive spirit it expects a result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the international court's decision on large screens across the country and hope that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia, which claims that, after decades of volatile talks, Chile must negotiate access for Bolivia to sovereign access to the sea.
Eva Morales, the Bolivian charismatic native president, who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has high expectations of Monday’s judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts feel that the court will not decide in favour of Bolivia — and even if it did, it would not change much.
A UN body based in the Netherlands is not authorised to assign Chilean territory to Bolivia and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court comes only six months after they listened to the final arguments means that the case “was not complicated”, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And for the past four years, they have not spoken in favor of Bolivia but may cost it much.
"The current Bolivian Government has taken advantage of the question of access to the sea," said Zárateev.
Morales ’ aggressive rhetoric sucked all the goodwill that might remain from the Chileans, she explained.
The talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to take part in the discussions.
They haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusual decision quickly.
Monday will bring to Bolivia an "exceptional opportunity for a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular Latin American presidents — used the maritime issue as a political support.
»Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,« he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea has declared that nuclear disarmament will not happen if it cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people would never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons unless they could trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri gave a talk at the United Nations General Assembly.
The United States has called for them to deliver on their promises made at the meeting between the leaders of the rival states in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when American Minister Mike Pompeo apparently before the nuclear diplomacy was restarted, which was at a standstill, more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the United States is wrong if they think that continuing sanctions and opposing the announcement of the end of North Korea's war will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious in securing the announcement, without first taking decisive steps to disarm Pyongyang.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is general doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the waiver of arms, which the State sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
In fashion magazines in Paris, reveal the latest line of huge hats coming to shop with affordable brands near you
If you want to complete your collection of headgear or hide completely from the sun, you do not need to look further.
In their collections for spring and summer 2019, designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed on their fashion runway a collection of bizarre overcoats that blinded the style of Paris Fashion Week.
The very impractical headgear flooded Instagram this summer, and the designers sent their spectacular creations to the fashion runway.
Valentine’s most prominent piece was a beige - colored hat with a wide brim, decorated with feathers - like accessories, in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons with expensive stones, a magic hat, and even pineapples — but they will not warm your head.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks have sewn lips and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter's mask than high fashion.
One creation was similar to snorkeling equipment and glasses, while the other looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion connoisseurs predict that giant hats will come to the shops near you.
Wide hats are closely followed by »La Bombi«, a straw hat with 60 centimeters, which was observed in Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand for an extremely impractical hat that flooded social networks sent another great creation on the runway – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the swimsuit model she was wearing.
The raffia bag in burnt orange, bordered by raffia tassels and a white leather handle, was the central part of the La Riviera collection of Jacquemus for spring/summer 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage’s famous stylist said of FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive at the shops for the following summer – because the designer made such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the requirement for over-addition.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial to global citizens
Scotland's independent schools enjoy the reputation of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exams, which are further strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the highest level of service for their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, the chosen career and the place they have as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement a tailor-made school programme, modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, the conversation is memorable.
But if you talk to a man in his mother tongue, words are imprinted in his heart.”
This is a good reminder that we should not rely solely on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year's results of recent exams show that languages are at the top of the ranking with the highest performance levels in independent schools.
68 percent of students who learned a foreign language achieved excellent grades.
Data collected in 74 schools in the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 percent of pupils achieved excellent grades in Mandarin, with 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This proves that schools of their own in Scotland support foreign languages as the key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated in the same way as subjects in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics as an optional subject in school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that 17 percent of the reasons why employers are struggling to fill vacancies can be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
For future job opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in the global world.
If a person learns another language, whatever career he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically takes precedence over competition.
The 2013 YouTube survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK showed that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to talk, and French was the only language spoken by two-digit percent of respondents, namely 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for children today.
With the knowledge of more languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, it will always be possible to choose a number of languages taught by professionals in this field in independent schools.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must also be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut Sunday in San Diego in Lakers' jersey.
For fans looking forward to LeBron James' first play for Los Angeles Lakers, the wait will soon be over.
The coach of Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play in the Sunday opening match against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But he doesn't know how many minutes he'll be playing.
"More than one and less than 48," Walton explained on the official website of the Lakers team.
The Lakers' official reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James would probably be playing for a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games before the season.
“I don’t need games before the season to prepare my career at this stage,” he said.
Trump convention in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting a series of conventions in Wheeling, West Virginia today in his campaign.
This is the first of Trump’s five planned conventions in the next week, including the stops in its favored countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As his candidate for the vacancy in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wishes to obtain support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
At what time will Trump’s convention be held in West Virginia, and where will it be possible to view it online?
Trump’s convention in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. Eastern Time.
You can watch Trump’s convention in West Virginia live online on YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about hearings of a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh this week, who have become tense with sexual misconduct charges, which is why the Senate's confirmation is expected to be delayed for a week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
However, the primary objective of this series of conventions is to help the Republicans, who face important elections in November, to gain new impetus.
As a result, the campaign of President Trump devoted these five conventions to “promoting volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives, reports Reuters.
“The monitoring of Congress is so important to his programme that during the difficult campaign season, the President will travel to as many countries as possible,” said a representative of the Trumpe campaign, who does not want to be appointed.
Today’s Wesbanco Arena Center in Wheeling, reportedly West Virginia MetroNews, could be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, attracting interest from the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, where he received more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate for the Senate from West Virginia to Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in public opinion research.
"To Morrisey is a bad sign that the president has to come and raise him in opinion polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team still has a desire to win and keeps hope before Sunday's individual matches
After three one-sided games, Saturday afternoon matches of two pairs (foursome) may have been what the Ryder Cup needed this year.
The swinging pendulum is an entirely fictional sport concept, but the players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where did the pendulum go now?
“They had six points ahead, but now they have four, so this is probably a new momentum for us,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, as it leads by four points, and it can get twelve more.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel that the wind is in their sails, and among other things, they were encouraged by the form Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three out of four points.
Spieth was fatal from the initial blow to the green and set a good example.
The screams of happiness continued to grow louder and lead to a decisive blow when he and Thomas evened out in the fourth game after a two - point delay.
The punch that brought them the win of the 15th hole was accompanied by a similar scream, one that lets you know that he believes that the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” said Spieth.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but charming twin of Europe has won four out of four and is unmistakeable.
The double "Molliwood" was the only one that didn't hit the buggy on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bugs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way in which the energy flows between them and the pumpkin audience are clearly confirmed by the fact that they are the players to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player could better seal Europe's potential victory than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over the Le Golf National.
And preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, a morning hero in a four - ball game that was in a pair with Alex Noren.
Because of the buggy and the two double bugs in the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swede fell into a crisis from which they could not find a way out.
On Saturday, the players won't have any help.
Games with four balls and matches of two sets is an exception interesting to follow from close up because of communication between couples, advice they give themselves, advice they do not give themselves, and the way in which strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better than the team so far and has a great advantage over the last day, but the matches of two teams have shown that the US team also has a desire to win, which some, particularly on the American side, have questioned.
Europe leads 10:6 before the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe goes on the last day of the Ryder Cup with a nice head start after the four-ball Saturday games and the two-ball matches lead to 10:6 U.S.A.
The excellent couple, made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, did their best and won over Tiger Woods with two victories and won four points on Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who strives to win the trophy she lost in Hazeltin two years ago, held the four-ball game in the mornings above the American team who sinned and led in a 3:1 series.
The U.S. team struggled better in two-man fights where they won two games, but they couldn't make up for the backlog.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 separate matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari (the couple were named Molliwood) after the sensational weekend, the second couple who won four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they once again proved themselves and even more convincingly defeated expended Woods and American rookie Bryson Decambeau with 5 and 4.
Woods, who ran through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed his brilliance, but lost 19 out of 29 games in four balls and two doubles, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for four ball games in the morning, returned for two-ball fights and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopka in a pair with Henry Stenson with two and one, ranked first and third in the world rankings.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, everything did not go according to the plans of Europe's team.
Three-time Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas winners set a new standard for Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1, they firmly won against the Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in the matches of the two pairs, losing the first two holes.
Only once in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returned after four points had been lost in front of the individual matches, although Furyk's team only needed a tie to preserve the trophy.
But after two days in second place, the Sunday counterattack may seem too much for her.
North Korea: “Without trust, we will not disarm unilaterally”
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the continued application of sanctions is causing increasing mistrust in the United States and that, under such conditions, North Korea will certainly not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
During the annual session of the General Assembly of this global body, Ri Jong Ho said that North Korea had taken a number of "significant measures in a good mood" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile experiments, tearing down a city for nuclear experiments and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see an adequate response from the United States,” he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we will not be sure of national security, and under such conditions we will by no means be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While Ri repeated the known complaints made by North Korea regarding the resistance of Washington to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would have been rewarded for taking gradual measures, his statement was important because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri took note of a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current president of the United States and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on 12 June. At that time, Kim committed to working for the “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula”, while Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea wants the official conclusion of the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also not yielded to calls for the release of the strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
“The US insists on first nuclear disarmament and on increasing the pressure of sanctions in order to force us to achieve our goals and even oppose the declaration of the end of the war,” said Ri.
»The thought that sanctions could bring us to our knees is an unrealistic hope of those who do not know us at all.
The problem, however, is that the continued application of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which was highlighted by the U.S. President at the UN Assembly at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Ja Ino, which took place over the past five months, and added: "If we had talked to South Korea about the problem of nuclear disarmament and not the US, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have ended up at such a deadlock."
Nevertheless, the tone of the Rio speech was quite different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the attack on the continental part of the United States with North Korean missiles was inevitable, after “Mr. Evil President” Trump Kim was described as a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim at the United Nations Assembly and his courage to take measures to disarm, but said that he still had a lot of work to do and that sanctions had to remain in force until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there was no time frame for this, stating: "It can take two years, three years or five months – it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: “The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must proceed decisively without exception until the state of nuclear disarmament is fully, definitively and verified.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions for North Korea to make it impossible to finance North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri in the margins of the United Nations General Assembly and later said that Pyongyang would visit again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he stated that progress had taken place and that North Korea had already criticised him in a few hours, claiming that his demands were "gangster".
At its meeting with Mun this month, North Korea has committed itself to demolish the missile testing station and nuclear testing infrastructure if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
Munu was to be told that the "appropriate measures" meant the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and measures to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students attend a course where they learn how to take enough time to rest
The goal of this year's course at Harvard University is to teach all undergraduate students how to afford more sleep. They want to fight the growing macho culture of "full-night" learning, where they accumulate their powers with caffeine.
A university professor found that students of the world’s best university often do not know the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, designed a course that he considered to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He decided to conduct such a course after his lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached him and said, "Why do I only find out now that I'm a senior?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important it was to sleep, and for The Daily Telegraph, the professor said that he was surprised.
This year's first course discusses the key importance of good sleeping habits for study and sport success as well as for improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and an executive director of the university’s medical services, says that they decided to take such a course when they found that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of the door of the student home, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to obtain information about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of lack of sleep on sports success and the importance of sleeping routine.
In the second section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of cardiac arrest, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the student settlement with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We realize that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to learn about these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health is affected by cigarette smoking," adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride is still present with the "overnight learning". He also adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, resulting in a lack of sleep, are a growing problem.
Professor Czeisler says that sufficient quality sleep should be a "secret weapon" for students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety. This can also avoid gaining weight – the brain becomes a form of hunger due to lack of sleep, making students constantly hungry.
A 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler design the course. Last year, during his first year at Harvard, he attended one of the professors' lectures.
He says that the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct the course throughout the campus.
He hopes that in the next phase he will be able to ask his post-graduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering the competition institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to set an alarm clock for sleep as well as waking up. He also wants to warn them about the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, as they can cause an imbalance of circadian rhythm, making it difficult to sleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1:0 Menga with a hit sunk up Gerrard team
Rangers defeated again in the guest: Dolly Menga in Livingston condemned Steven Gerrard's team to defeat at 1:0.
The team from Ibrox was chasing their first guest victory after the reign of February at St. Johnstone Stadium at 4: 1, but Gary Holt's team had won the second defeat in 18 matches since Gerrard was at the head of the team, leaving his team behind 8 points for the Scottish League's leading team.
The Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the chosen range of Rangers did not appear to want to equalize.
With this the Rangers fell to a lot of places, and Livingston advanced to third place, but with the difference of goals retarded, the Hibernian team
Calum Spence, the side judge, suffered a head injury when, according to reports, an object from the host team's cheerleading station flew in.
Gerrard made eight trades on the crew, who easily defeated Ayr and became the semifinals of the Betfred Cup Cup.
On the other hand, Holt kept to the verified Eleven Livingston, who had taken away the point from the Hearts a week earlier, and he was no doubt impressed by how his established team effectively neutralized all the guest experiments.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingston took better advantage of it.
The first opportunity came just two minutes after Menga found Scott Pittman with the first short pass, who then went to Allan McGregor's goal, but the vizier was imprecise and missed the opportunity.
The long free shot by Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but then his defense assistant Alan Lithgow failed to score.
In the last third, Rangers took control, but the game showed more hope than the actual desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was quite certain that after a collision with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes of the game, a penalty shot should have been served, but Judge Steven Thomson had crushed Colombian's demands in the bud.
The Rangers managed to put together only two shots on the goal, but not a head shot sent to the goal by Lassana Coulibaly, not even a limp ball by Ovie Ejarijai, posed no danger to Liam Kelly's goalkeeper.
Livingston's opening goal in 34 minutes may have surprised everyone, but he was well deserved for his persistence.
The Rangers couldn't cash another Jacobs plug with a long pass.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher got the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi's pass for a simple end to the attack.
Gerrard took action to replace Coulibaly with Ryan Kent's wingman, who immediately turned out to be a match to Morelos, but Kelly ran off his line and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests to play, where Lithgow and Halkett took care of more passes in front of the goal.
Holt's team could have increased the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was imprecise after the corner pass.
In the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given a chance to take a penalty shot at the end of the game after contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson did not admit it.
Almanah: Inventor of the Geiger counter
We present a page from the yearbook of our Sunday editions: September 30, 1882, that is, today more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm »Hans« Geiger was born in Germany, who later became a world-famous physicist.
Geiger has developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and this invention has been the basis for the development of a device called the Geiger counter.
He became a regular in the scientific world, and he also took his place in pop culture, such as "Bells of Coronado" in 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play cowboy scientists:
Men: »What the hell is this?«
Rogers: »This is the Geiger counter. It is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect that it has on atoms of radioactivity in materials.”
Evans: »Oh, my God, now they're talking!«
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
An invention with his name lives on.
A new anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize attack cells
A new anticancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize the attack cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize attack cells in the course of therapy.
This method involves the procurement of the patient’s immune cells, which are then altered in the laboratory
After this, they can “see” a protein that is typical of many forms of cancer, then return to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognise attack cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves the procurement of the patient’s immune cells, which they change in the laboratory so that they can “see” the HER2 protein that is typical of many forms of cancer and then re-inject.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Research Institute of Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A., said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “encourages the growth of several different types of cancer” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer.
A similar approach to the production of immune cells in patients who are “teached” to target cancer cells has also worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West performed a protrumpe point with MAGA on the cap after performing at the SNL.
Audience Not Enthusiasmed
Kanye West was whistled in the studio of Saturday Night Live at a weird spot during which he expressed his support for American President Donald Trump and also said that 2020 would compete for the chair.
After he finished performing with the third song of his performance "Ghost Town", during which he wore a cap with the inscription "Make America Great Again", West began to attack the Democrats and re-express his support for Trump.
»I often talk to a white person and say to me: »How can you like Trump, because he is racist?«
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago,” he says.
This time, the SNL show began with a parody with Matt Damon, where a Hollywood actor made a mockery of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Commission, accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
The recording of West's monologue was not broadcast, but it was uploaded into social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock intended to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that he had some problems in the backstage due to the sign on his hat.
"They came after me behind the stage.
They told me, "Don't go on stage with that hat."
I've been harassed!
And they say I'm lost," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: »Do you want to see the lost scene?« and added that he must put on »Superman's cape, because that means no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments led the audience to whistle at least twice, and the members of the SNL team were clearly embarrassed, and someone also said to Vanity: »The studio had a deadly silence.«
West was last-minute invited a goat replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
The song was released on September 11, 2009, and was released on December 11, 2009.
Westa was supported by Candace Turner, the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR BELONGING.”
However, the speaker of Karen Hunter’s talk show tweeted that West was simply “what it is, and that’s just fine.
However, I am not going to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his "art"), who in my opinion welcomes and extends an ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and from now on he would be "a creature formally known as Kanye West. Now I am YE."
He's not the first musician to decide to change his name, but he's already done it before Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His homeboy Snoop Dogg was once called Snoop Lion, but we cannot forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name into a symbol, and then he was an artist once known as Prince.
A man accused of attempted murder for stabbing a person in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old male is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamor.
The defendant has to report to the Belfast courthouse on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the DA's office.
Kit Harington's Game of Thrones star has taken a sharp stand against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his swinging sword in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval-colored fantasy series Game of Thrones.
A 31-year-old player who has strongly condemned the stereotype of a masturbating hero says that the appearance of such roles on screens often makes young boys feel that respect can only be earned through resilience.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture that in his opinion something had gone wrong and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the period of movement #IJeja.
An actor who recently married a 31-year-old playmate from the Rose Leslie Thrones Games admitted to having strong beliefs on this subject.
“I am personally seriously wondering at the moment where we made a mistake when it comes to manhood,” he said.
»What did we teach men as we grew up about the problems we now face?«
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity by displaying very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is inborn and what is taught?
What do they teach us on TV and on the streets that young boys feel they have to choose this particular side of masculinity?
I think one of the important questions of our time is how can we change that?
Because apparently something went wrong with young men.”
In the interview he also said that at the end of the series next summer he would not participate in filming any prehistory or continuation of the Game of Thrones because he “ended with battlers and horses”.
In November, Kit will play the lead role of the new adaptation of True West Sam Shepard, the story of the film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened because of Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose on the set.
»I met my wife because of this series, so in a way she gave me my future family and life from here on,« he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love pick of Kit's character Jon Snow, in a fantasy series award-winning with Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted through sexual intercourse, which represents a change compared to the past.
Usually, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to a transfusion of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Junan Province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has declined to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS continues to increase by 100,000 a year in China.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a very pressing problem in the Chinese community of LGBT.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against people from the LGBT community is still very much present.
Since conservative values still apply in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men marry a woman over time.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff has released data on Republican senators, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters dismissed the allegations that a member of her staff had released data on three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
A Los Angeles democracy has claimed that these accusations come from individuals and websites of the far right.
"Lies, lies and more inadmissible lies," wrote Waters in a Twitter statement.
According to the published information, the home addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah are included.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during the Senate's session of charges of sexual harassment against a candidate for Supreme Court judge, Brett Kanaugh.
Information leaks occurred after three senators closed the hearing of Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicate that an IP address can identify a source of publication that would be linked to Senator Waters' office and conclude that information was published by one of the staff, reports Hill.
“These unfounded accusations are completely wrong and pure lies” continues Waters.
»My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are at risk because of these false accusations, are not in any way responsible for the leaking of this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely untrue and pure lies.”
Senator Waters' statement quickly came across criticisms on the Internet, including by former White House representative Ari Fleischer.
"From this denial of the branch of anger," Fleischer wrote.
“This may mean that it is not the right test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he didn't do, he can't show anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not question the motive of the one who accused him.
He must remain calm.”
Fleischer compared the response of Waters to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being overly angry during a Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is in the middle of an election for the city of Waters, came by on Twitter.
"If that's true, it's serious," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her cabinet informed “relevant institutions and law enforcement authorities about these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed”, she continued, “and that they will be held accountable for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and all of them.”
Johnny English again in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for clues to Brexit in any new British film has become traditional, and it is also true for the reviving of Johnny English action comedy, which first came to the screen in 2003 entitled Johnny English and the continuation in 2011 titled Johnny English 2.
Will it be a fun satire about how lousy we are, a new export opportunity for us?
The uncompetent Johnny English gets permission to mix the stumps again with the eye-outs and the unusual faces; his name suggests that it is a comic character created for a cinematic audience in non-English-speaking areas.
It's an awkward secret agent who, despite his bizarre gestures, contains a piece of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a little bit of the one who contributed the last note to the Chariots of Fire at the ceremony at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also based on the traveler and the international mystery man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten TV commercial for Barclaycard, leaving behind real chaos.
The latest film presents one or two pleasant moments.
I loved it when Johnny English was getting closer in the helicopter, wearing medieval armor, and the rotor leaves were hitting his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly illustrated, but humor seems somewhat mild and excessively unnecessary, especially since "serious" films like 007 or Mission impossible now offer comic elements without a conscience.
It seems humor is meant for children and not so many adult viewers, which is why Johnny English's repulsive adventures are not as innovative and directed as Atkinson's silent sketches in the role of Mr Bean.
The constant subject is now obvious that Britain is in serious trouble.
An online hacker infiltrated the British's most secret agent web network and exposed the identities of all British agents, causing great difficulties to the competent agent, represented by Kevin Eldon in a surprisingly small role.
This is a turning point for the Prime Minister, a pompous figure that has already suffered a breakdown because of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson has tried to play the role of the supposed Teresa May, but there is nothing tangible in the script that can help her.
Intelligence informs her that all active spies are exposed, so she has to choose one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a prominent school teaching unofficially how to operate undercover: here the writers have hit, because English is conducting some kind of spy "rock academy".
English is taken to Whitehall for an emergency meeting where he meets a longtime associate of Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-boat commander, a stereotypical sports enthusiast, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine loses quite a bit.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create more trouble in the name of Her Majesty's secret service, and meet the Fatalka Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister dangerously falls under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: this is the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: dressed as waiters, they set a fire to a French restaurant, create chaos when they sneak aboard the Volt yacht, and when English tries to use virtual reality glasses to get to know the inside of the Volt house, he manages to create general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite its sympatheticity and energy, it resembles a children's film.
Very mediocre.
Like the other movies of Johnny English, I can't help myself here, and I think: Is British film capable of giving Atkinson a role that actually justifies his talent?
Laburists deny that they are planning a four-day working week for the British, with payment for a five-day working week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive a five-day payment.
The customer wants the company's leaders to pour the savings generated by companies as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution into workers and give them an extra day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three - day weekend on an equally high salary.
Sources say that the idea fits the party's economic plan and plans to put the state on the side of the workers.
Trade unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as this is a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
A source from the Labour Party declared for The Sunday Times: 'The policy review was to be published before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but four weeks’ working hours are an objective that we will strive to achieve through the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party supported the four-week working week in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A representative of the Labour Party said: "The four-week working week is not party policy and the party does not think about it."
The shadow chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to take the power out of "inconsiderate directors" and "profits" in municipal companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that current stakeholders in water companies may not regain their full share, as the Labour Party would be able to introduce "deductions" on the basis of alleged injustices.
It also confirmed plans to include workers in boards and to introduce equity funds, thus transferring 10% of the shares in private companies to employees who would receive annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, on "60 minutes" ("60 minutes"), discussed whether their opinion could change the investigation of Kavanaugh by the FBI.
The investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI is a delayed final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question whether the findings of any Republican senator's office could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In an interview that was broadcast on Sunday, the correspondent of the show “60 minutes” asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was anything the FBI could discover that would change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open to it than a colleague from South Carolina.
»I mean, of course,« said Kennedy.
»Before the hearing began, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh
When I called him when this accusation came up, I asked him, ‘Did you do it?’
He was determined, unwavering, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice seems to be carved in stone.
“I created my own opinion of Brett Kavanaugh and would need an extremely convincing reason to change it,” he said.
“ I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it,” added Graham, mentioning Christine Blasey Ford.
»And none of those she named could confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don’t see any new change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed in any way to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual musical event with a truly remarkable range of stars and a mission of the same magnitude: to eliminate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will be held for the seventh time, will be attended by tens of thousands of people. They will occupy the Grand lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances by musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to attract interest in the real purpose of the event, namely the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Citizens' Project, an international advocacy group, which hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for the VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, a letter to the world leader, a telephone call or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
How successful is the Global Citizen movement, which has remained for 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to take action, or is it just another example of so-called "clictivism" – creating a belief that people actually have a significant influence on the situation by signing an online petition or transmitting a tweet?
The Global Citizen movement states that more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters are expected to be recorded in the pursuit of a series of different objectives from 2011.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to make commitments and policies worth more than USD 37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group stated that it was the result of 390 commitments and communications that had already paid or collected at least USD 10 billion.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and decision makers who are committed to "help children realise their full potential", which promised Rwanda USD 35 million to help eliminate malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the Global Citizens movement.
“With the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments and global citizens such as yourself, we can put social injustice of malnutrition in historical archives,” told Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Power of Food, to the London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that following more than 5,000 actions that called for the United Kingdom to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced that it would co-finance the Food Power project, which would reach 5 million women and children with food measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, "Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?",
"This will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights movement and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Some of the performers who will attend this year's event in New York include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe. The event will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a “block” of Russian energy exports — the U.S. Department of Internal Affairs
According to the Washington Examiner newspaper, US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke reported that Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy marketing, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of a legitimate government) is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that their presence in the Middle East is due to the desire to market energy, as it is marketed in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
However, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can do this. The Navy makes sure our maritime routes are open and blocked, if necessary, to prevent Russian energy products from flowing into the market,” he said.
Zinke turned to the participants of the event hosted by the Energy Consumers' Association, a non-profit group called the “voice of energy consumers” in the USA.
He compared Washington's accession to Russia and Iran, pointing out that it was actually the same.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option is more or less to influence and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “pony that knows one trick” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements were made at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it is intended to replace Russia, which is a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Government of Trumpe, including the US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to give up the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump Berlin, is supposed to be the "taller" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth USD 11 billion, which is expected to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington is fiercely opposed to the project only for economic reasons and that this is an unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we share the same view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose suppliers,” said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak after the September meeting with the US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected the US position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“The involvement of a third country in our energy supply is a major problem for me” said Dieter Kempf, Head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “exactly examine” her candidacy in the elections for the US President in 2020, says the Massachusetts Senator.
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would “exactly examine” her candidacy as American President after the midterm elections.
At the City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she's going to consider her candidacy.
“It is time for women to go to Washington and correct our corrupt government, which requires a female leader,” she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will examine my candidacy as president."
At a meeting at the city hall, Warren rebuked President Donald Trump, who was supposed to lead this country in the wrong direction.
“What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy worries me terribly,” she said.
Warren has repeatedly openly criticised Trump and the candidate for the Supreme Court President, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in the tweet, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the election."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most of her own constituents felt that Warren should not be in the position of president in 2020.
According to a poll by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk / Boston Globe newspaper, the senator should not have run for president, fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters from Massachusetts.
Thirty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The survey showed that the former Governor of Deval Patrick had more support for the candidacy, supported by 38 percent of respondents and 48 percent of respondents.
Other high-ranking democrats who would be eligible for election in 2020 are former vice-president Joe Biden and senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden said that he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder in support of Donald Trump.
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through after his return connects me with other families who are coping with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain amount of injury that our soldiers are returning to,” he told the audience at the rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described her son's arrest as a "loop in the salon" and said that her son and other war veterans are returning slightly changed, hardened, wondering where there is respect for what his fellow soldiers and airmen and all the other members of the army donated to the country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence by assaulting a woman, obstructing the report of domestic violence and possession of a drunk weapon, said Dan Bennett, a representative of the Wasilla police station.
18 federal states and Colombia’s district support the rebuttal of a new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and Colombia are supporting the legal rebuttal of a new American policy which deprives victims of the right to asylum when fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 countries and the district in question filled the lobby on Friday in order to support the legal rejection of the policy.
The entire name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions' lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Association against federal policy has not been published.
She said that she had been abused by her partner and “his violent sons, members of the gang”, but on 20 July the US authorities rejected her request for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors of the states supporting Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which many asylum applications in the United States come, as countries constantly facing gang problems and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new US asylum policy annulled the decision of the Immigrant Appeals Committee, which allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement on Friday, the Attorney General of Columbia District, General Karl Racine, said that the new policy "protests decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be assessed on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition infringes this principle,” states the request made to the court.
In their request, the public prosecutors further stated that a policy which denies immigrants' right of entry is detrimental to the American economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "provide the necessary workforce".
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence in June.
“Azil is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” said the Sessions in his policy announcement on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even serious problems, that people face all over the world every day.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are underway to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"The feeling is very intense," said Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her hot boy at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Emergency rescuers carry bodies all the time.
Clean water is scarce.”
It looked like the townspeople returning to the destroyed homes, struggling through soaked things, trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals destroyed by a 7.5 - degree earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a back and shoulder injury, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated in the open - air due to constant stress.
When he remembered the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
»There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed against the ruins of the walls," Harris told the Associated Press agency. He added that he and his family were in town for the wedding.
“I heard a woman crying for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
The American Ambassador accuses Chinese "harassment" with "propaganda advertisements"
One week after the publication of a four-page advertisement of the official Chinese newspaper in the American Journal, which praised the mutual benefits of the US-China trade, the US Ambassador in China, Beijing, accused the US press of being abused to spread propaganda.
On the last Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned a paid bonus for China Daily in the newspaper Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the US Congress elections on November 6, which China denies.
The Reuters Agency reported that U.S. federal officials have described Trump's accusation of Beijing trying to interfere in the U.S. Federal elections as a new phase in Washington's ever-increasing efforts to press China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to publish trade promotion advertisements, Beijing and Washington are currently entangled in an increasingly intense trade war in which they exchange blows by imposing customs duties on import products.
Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war are said to affect exporters in federal states such as Iowa, who support Trump's Republican Party, have been said by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a column in the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register, "now duplicates this harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press".
“In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government used the respected American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
»On the other hand, you will see few other opinions and no real reflections on the diversity of opinions that Chinese citizens have about the worrying Chinese economic path, as the media is strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,« he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers rejected the offer to publish” of his article, although he did not state which one.
Republicans are losing voters before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warning analysts
The analysts point out that the support of many of the most important Republicans who support and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual assault, will be known in the upcoming interim elections with the loss of voters.
The emotions here are extremely high, and most Republicans have already said that they want to continue voting.
This cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse for an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be enough to calm down angry voters.
»Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget this either tomorrow or November,« said Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Counsellor and National Representative of the Advanced MoveOn Group, on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang "Noveber is coming!" when they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate, when the Republicans supervising the judicial committee decided to continue their support for Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the news portal Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will go beyond all limits,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-participant political analyst, told the journalists of the portal.
"People say they're strong already, and that's true.
But it could be even stronger, especially between undefined voters in suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29 who do not like the President, but do not often vote.”
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault by a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts said that further Republican support could have negative consequences.
“This has become a major mess for the GOP,” reported NBC News earlier last week, said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Council.
“It is not just about the vote of the Council or the final vote or Kavanaugh's oath; it is also about the way Republicans deal with it and how Ford was treated,” said Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group, who supports the Democrats in the elections.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided between whether to believe more in Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony, and a little more support for the latter.
The new YouTube survey shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or most believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent said that they certainly or most believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they believed that Kavanaugh was likely or certainly lying when he testified, and only 30 percent said so about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flake FBA, he is currently investigating charges made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week before the Senate Council, Ford testified under oath that Kavanaugh, when she was 17 years old, in a drunk state, attacked her.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her genitalia when they were at the party together during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is opening up a start-up company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners Open Source Platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention of Inrupt was "to rule the world".
"We decided to do it now", he said about a new company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable users to create a "personal storage repository" or POD
This may include contact details, to-do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
A special feature of a personal data storage repository is that the user can fully determine who can access what information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment with data".
Executive Director John Bruce says that the idea of a company is to pool resources, processes and appropriate skills that will allow access to the Solid platform for everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Already this week technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group "do not talk to Facebook and Google about whether we could introduce a complete change that could end all their business models overnight."
"We don't ask permission."
In a Saturday’s publication on the Medium portal, Berners-Lee stated that Inrupt’s intention was to “provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid platform.”
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by setting up the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the Internet,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The Festival of the Bearer of Victoria’s Cross from World War I
For 100 years, the home town has been celebrating the award of Victoria’s Cross to the only priest of the English Church who had won it as a fighter in World War I.
On September 29th, 1918, Reverend Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann earned his recognition in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was shot by a sniper, so he never found out that he had been granted the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of the colonel's grandchildren discovered a memorial stone.
One of his great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's act, which earned him a medal.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann, on 29 September 1918, led his battalion through the Saint Quintin Channel “through a very thick fog and under the heavy fire of the battlefield and the machinery spaces.”
Later, he marched towards the firing line and led the line forward with “the greatest heroism” and then attacked the machine gun himself and hit three members of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 2018 — just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of my grandfather were "something I know and could never achieve, so teach me humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade led by the band Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt "very honored to be a part of this parade," and "that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will give."
The fans of mixed martial arts were up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead, they were given Piglet Pepe.
Imagine, you were up all night watching a completely sold-out Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The San Jose event involved 13 matches, including six on the main parquet, and was broadcast live in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegand Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to fight, the audience in the United Kingdom found out that the broadcast had been replaced by the cartoon Piggy Pep.
A lot of people weren't too excited, because he stayed up until morning because of the fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as a "some kind of sick joke".
"In accordance with the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication when asked about the transfer.
"Pep Pig. Yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they were trying to adjust the schedule so that viewers in the UK would also be involved in the future.
“When I think about replaying, I think we could sort this out,” said Coker.
“But then it’s 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, and we won’t be able to settle it by Sunday in our time or Monday in their own way.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, many messages were exchanged during the switchover and not everyone was nice.
We tried to settle it; we assumed it was just a technical error.
However, the actual reason was the government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we're going to put up with five fights – the same as usual. We tried to offer our fans more than expected, and we got it wrong.
It is a very ungrateful situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" about sex.
The Olympic diver Tom Daley said that because of his sexual orientation, he felt inferior to everyone – but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old boy said that he realized that "not everyone is like him" when he entered high school.
In his first talk on Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4, he said that he spoke about gay rights in order to give others "hope".
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympic Games diminished.
The regular host of a long-standing show, Kirsty Young, has been absent for months of illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outlaw on Laverne's first show, said that he felt "less worthy" than anyone else, because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: "To date, these feelings of inferiority and diversity are real things that give me the strength and perseverance to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was »something«, said he would not disappoint anyone who would finally find out about his orientation.
The two bronze Olympic competitor has become an influential champion of LGBT rights and has appeared twice this year at the National League Games in Australia to urge countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy, that he could speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give others 'hope'.
The three-time world champion said that romance with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, with whom he met in 2013 – had "sustained him."
Daley married an Oscar winner over 20 years of age last year, but he says that the age difference was never a problem.
“When you are so young” – at the age of 14 he attended the first Olympic Games and three years later his father died – he said that it is difficult to find someone of the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.
In June, the couple adopted a child, Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley says that this changed his "total view".
“If you had asked me last year, all I had to say would be “I have to reach the gold medal”, he said.
»But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets to London 2012, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't say to him, "You won't be in the front row this time, Dad," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead did I finally have to admit that he was not invulnerable,” he said.
The next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving at the Olympic Games in front of a local audience. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This was also inspired by his first choice of song – Proud musician Heather Small, who accompanied him in the preparations for the Olympic Games and who still creeps his skin out.
Desert Island Discs broadcasts at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 (BST).
Unprepared Mickelson sat over the Ryder Cup Saturday night.
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to return to form so that this does not become an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who will be participating in a record 12th time in the biennial event, left Captain Furyk to sit on the Saturday four.
Instead of being at the heart of what was so common for the United States, the five - time winner spent the day partly as a cheerleader and partly in improving his game in order to correct what was bothering him.
Given that even at the height of his career he did not aim the most straight, the 48-year-old does not fit the narrowest Le Golf National field, where the long ice inevitably punishes the missed blows.
And if it wasn't intimidating enough, Mickelson will have to deal with the exact winner of the British Open Francescom Molinari Cup in the ninth game on Sunday, who has been in league with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood in all four games this week.
If the Americans, who have four fewer games at the beginning of the 12 individual games, had a good start, Mickelson could have proved decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he did not say much.
“He fully understands the role he played today, pats me on the back and hugs me with his hand and says that he will be ready tomorrow,” said Furyk.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is one of the most famous and has contributed tremendously to the teams in the past and this week as well.
I guess I didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it worked out that way, and we thought it should be done that way.
He wants to play like everybody else.”
Mickelson's gonna break Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the biggest number of Ryder Cup games ever played.
This could mark the end of the Ryder Cup's career, which never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven matches, but Furyk said that his presence on the team also brings some unscrupulous benefits.
»He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and it's great to have him in the teamroom,« he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun fighting him this week, which was fun to see."
It gives much more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon fall short
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage at the beginning of the last day of the games of individuals in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant ride.
In 1997, the young Dane debuted at a game in Valderrama, where the site, whose captain was Seve Ballesteros, had five points ahead of the Americans, and through the goal it had only a close advantage, with a score of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
»Do not forget that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but barely,« said Bjorn (in the picture) after seeing the Class of 2018 team, who won with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and led on the Le Golf National course with 10-6.
So history shows me and everyone on the team that the trophy isn't over yet.
Play full game tomorrow.
Go and do whatever it takes.
The game isn't over until it says so on the board.
We have a goal to win this trophy, and we need to stay focused on it.
He has always said that I am focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we are also well aware of who stands on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
He was impressed by the playing of his players on the challenging field, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of myself here.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
Tomorrow, the game of individuals will be at the forefront, so we will have to do it differently.
It's nice to have a partner, when things go well, but when you're there alone, your golfer skills are tested to the end.
This is a message you have to pass on to the players: tomorrow you have to get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind and he must get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the last day's reversals, as he was part of a winning team in Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe carried out the "A miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, led his players on the last day of the game.
»Tomorrow we have 12 big games, but we want to start as fast as we saw in Brookline, as we saw in Medina.
When this momentum gets persistent, it puts strong pressure on the middle games.
We created the right layout and put the boys in the way we felt we would do something magical tomorrow.«
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the battle and fighting Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“I chose this order with this group of boys because I think it covers the entire schedule,” said Bjorn on the choice of individuals.
The new German warship has been delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be committed to its deployment in 2014 in order to replace the ageing Cold War warships, but due to the failure of the systems and rapidly rising costs it will not be until at least next year, the local media reported.
The transfer of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the new class frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, says the newspaper Die Zeit, which lists a military representative.
The vessel should join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project is facing worrying issues after delivery.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships scheduled in 2007 will replace the ageing class of the Bremen class frigate.
It is expected that they will have a strong cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some cloaking technologies such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals – the latest frigates are expected to remain outside the home port for up to two years.
The continued delays mean, however, that by the moment of its application, the world-class warships, which are supposed to enable Germany to exert its power beyond the sea, will become obsolete, notes the newspaper Die Ziet.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the cover last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the return are limited, and the German media have cited a number of key "software and technical deficiencies", which would render the warship useless if it were sent to a battle mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on the senior frigates of the Bremen class.
The ship has also proved to be very difficult, reducing its capacity and limiting the potential of the Navy for its future upgrading.
The 700-ton ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the whole project – including crew training – has become a problem.
This is expected to reach a dizzying EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion) – from an initial EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is diminishing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the Navy was in fact "a shortage of ships suitable for deployment."
The official said that over time the issue was exacerbated because old ships were decommissioned and replacement vessels were not provided.
He regretted that no ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
A new study is taking place in the Highlands of Scotland to find out how bats use their food to hunt for food.
They hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the study, scientists from the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will accompany small bats and tiny bats and brown bats and bypass bats on the Inverewe Gardens estate in the Wester Ross area.
Special recorders will be set up to monitor bat activity throughout the season in key locations of the estate.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using manual detectors.
Professional audio analysis of all recordings will confirm the frequency of bat calls and what types of what they're doing.
They will then draw up a habitat map and a report to provide a detailed picture of their behavior throughout the landscape.
Rob Dewar, an NTS nature conservation consultant, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are most suitable for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has decreased sharply in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which affects shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as flytraps and some types of chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by pets also pose a risk.
Bats aren't really blind.
Because of their night - to - night hunting habits, they use their ears rather than their eyes to catch their prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to accurately identify errors and obstacles along the flight path.
The NTS, responsible for supplying more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly conduct research, reviews of shelters and occasional rescues.
The organization even established the first and only Scottish reserve, specifically dedicated to bats, at the Threeave estate in the area of Dumfries and Galloway.
The manager of the property, David Thompson, says that the estate is the perfect territory for them.
“We have an excellent area for bats in Thravo,” he said.
»We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and all the quality habitat.
However, much is still known about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us to understand better what they need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance work on holdings, since the possible accidental destruction of a single bat hospital could lead to the death of up to 400 females and puppies, which could result in the collapse of the entire local population.
Bats are protected, so it is forbidden to kill, harass or disturb them, and it is forbidden to destroy their maternity home.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish leader of the Bat Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: "We still have much to learn about our bats, and for many species we simply do not know how well they stick to their populations."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and lawyers are preparing to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges he allegedly committed as “false news” and said that people wanted to “promot themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine with the news of Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus attackers were accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay her $375.000 to remain silent about the event.
At the address of 142 million followers in Instagram Live video several hours after reporting, Ronaldo, 33, described the reports as "false news"
»No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was false news," said the five-time Golden Ball winner in the camera.
»By using my name they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which is part of the work I do.
I am a happy man and I wish everyone well," the smiling actor added.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for accusations called "unacceptable reporting of suspicions of private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for “non-material damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the apartment of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In documentation filed with the District Court of Clark, Nevada, she was to return to the actor’s room after a meeting at the Mayorga Night Club, where she was to be raped.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the event and told her that he was a "99 % good man", which only disappoints in "one percent".
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed sexual intercourse, but he described it as consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she was on her way to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, and later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “awesome fear of revenge” and was concerned about“public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old claims that she wants to overturn the settlement as she continues to suffer severe trauma as a result of the alleged event.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was about to be transferred from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juventus, according to an agreement worth $100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would always regret the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom “would regret forever” if, after Brexit, it lost its status as the world's leading car manufacturer, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "a cause for concern" that Toyota UK had said to BBC that the exit of Great Britain from the EU would have temporarily stopped production at a factory in Burnaston, near Derby, without agreement.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of brexit could lead to job losses without agreement.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain left the European Union at the end of March without an agreement, production at our factory would stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at the Burnaston factory.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed concerns about the impact of the European Union's exit without agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, said that after Brexit, it would close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of brexite.
Toyota's production line operates on the "right-time" principle, with parts of UK and EU suppliers coming every 37 minutes for custom-ordered cars.
If the United Kingdom left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, this could lead to disturbances at the borders, which industry representatives say could lead to congestion and a lack of parts.
Toyota in its Derbyshire factory could not be stored for more than one day of parts, said representatives of the company, so the production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks".
“We have to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will enable us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to seize this opportunity”, he said about Today’s BBC Radio 4.
"Data not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers are that we must be absolutely capable of continuing a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not comment on how long production would have been stopped, but in the long term it pointed out that the additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite Union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, the job lost will never be returned.”
The government representative said: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor General, Rod Rosenstein, could be postponed for another week because of the ongoing fight over the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Advisor Robert Mueller, who is studying Russian electoral interference, the links between Trump's colleagues and Russia, and the potential President's obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump will fire the DA's envoy and put Mueller's independence at risk has been feeding the Washington rumors for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a listening device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
On the last Monday, he visited the White House in the middle of reporting his intention to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations conference in New York, was declared Thursday.
Trump said that he would rather not forgive Rosenstein, and then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict by questioning the Senate's judicial committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behaviour, Dr. Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's vote.
Trump's spokesperson, Sarah Sanders, showed up on the Fox News show on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date is not yet fixed for him. It could happen this week, given everything else going on at the Supreme Court, we could delay him for another week.
We'll see. I always like to make sure you're informed.”
Some reporters would object, but Sanders hasn't called a meeting of the White House with the press since September 10th.
The head of Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the rarity of meetings was not to be attributed to the resistance to "setting up" TV reporters, but she said: "I could not deny that they are showing up."
Then she mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The President holds more press conferences than any President before him,” she said, adding without stating the source: “We looked at the numbers.”
The meetings will still be held,” said Sanders. “But if journalists can contact the President of the United States directly with their question, this is infinitely better than discussing with me.
We are trying to make this possible and you have seen that we have often done so in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference at your disposal to talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with guest statesmen.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York City, the president may have shown why this week when he showed up in front of the assembled press in a free-minded and partly bizarre manner.
Letter from the Minister for Health to EU workers in NHS Scotland on concerns related to brexite
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working on the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and the desire to continue their work after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, an SME, sent a letter less than six months before the UK exit from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying the cost of applications to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit continued, as decisions were taken this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
I would therefore like to emphasise once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union and from non-EU countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we supply.
In Scotland you can feel completely at home. We very much want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie urgently operated after head injury
After a head injury in a Saturday defeat of 31:27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores team, Mike Organ of The Tennessee reported.
The head coach of Tennessee State University told the press that the injury occurred just before halftime.
»He came to the edge of the field and collapsed there somehow,« Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the edge of the field before laying him on a stretcher and taking him off the field for further inspection.
An official at the University of Tennessee told Chris Harris on the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie is recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “details on the nature/volume of the injury are not yet known” and that the Tonneese State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, currently a freshman at the university, plays for the Tennessee State University for the first time since the transition from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he took five blows before he got out of the game, which raised his total number of hits in the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people according to new Tories plans
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to collect up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of hipwood when they buy real estate in the UK and the money collected will be paid to homeless people, Theresa May will be notified today.
The move should be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to ensure more affordable housing and to increase the taxation of high income earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be charged to non-taxable persons and businesses in the United Kingdom, and additional money will stimulate government efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The mark-up – to be charged in addition to the current stampage, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and property for broadcasting, could amount to no less than three per cent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year by introducing the measure.
It is estimated that non-UK nationals purchase 13 percent of London’s newly built real estate, resulting in a price increase and a difficult purchase of the first real estate.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become a ghost town, as the number of buyers who spend most of their time outside the country increases.
A new policy was adopted just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in hipwood to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of rising prices by actually not using the land, and he called on Ms Maye to abandon the quotas for affordable housing to correct British "residential shame."
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and the completion of forced evictions without error.
It also wishes to give the city council greater authority to build new homes.
Ms. Mayeva said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my lead to restoring British dreams – that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means correcting our inactive housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and create life.
It cannot be right, however, for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign businesses, to buy homes as easily as for the hardworking British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home is far too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains all too real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to manage the Scotland Club."
Head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his “final goal” was once to become manager of the Scotland Club.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which currently holds third place in the First League, with three points less than the first ranked.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship in the last season.
"I wanted to play as an actor for my country.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross said about the BBC Scotland's Sportsound show.
“But I grew up with frequent observation of Scotland in Hampton as a child, so it was always something that dragged me back.
This opportunity would only be offered if I were successful in running the club.”
Ross' predecessors at the head of Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of the Alloa Athletic team, who had previously rejected the offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says that as the successor to such great names he did not feel fear.
“The success is measured for me by the question “Can I take this club back to the First League?”
Given the structure and capacity of this club undoubtedly belongs to the First League," he said.
"The road to there is not easy, but it would probably be considered successful only if the club could take it back."
Ross has only been working as a manager for three years after he was assistant manager in Dumbarton and 15 months of coaching staff of the Hearts.
Alloi then helped prevent the third league from falling out, and St. Mirren led from the edge of the fall to the championship championship in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever while playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"This was probably a real turning point", he recalled the takeover of Alloe.
»I really believed that management was the right thing for me, much more than acting.
It sounds funny, because I was doing well as an actor, and I made a pretty good living with it, and I also achieved some major successes.
But the game can become difficult.
A lot of things have to be dealt with every week.
I still deal with this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management simply feels like the right thing for me.
I've always wanted to run the club and I'm doing it now. I feel more comfortable in my whole adult life.”

Research results: ideal time for beer on Saturday at 5:30
The summer heat increased the income of hard - to - break British pubs, but pressure on restaurant chains also increased.
pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant for CGA who prepared the data, said: "The persistent sunny weather and the participation of England in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a pattern similar to that of June in the previous month, when the income of pubs increased by 2.8 percent, only restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall in restaurant traffic increased by 1.8 percent in June.
Traffic in pubs and pubs with drinks increased more in comparison than in restaurants.
Sun weather has also reduced sales in pubs offering mainly food, but not as dramatic as in restaurant managers.
It seems that people simply wanted to go out for a drink.
In different pubs and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6 percent in one month, while food sales decreased by three percent.”
Paul Newman, a group of free time analysts and RSM hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in the market for hotels and restaurants.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight, although a fall of 4.8 percent on an annual basis will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
For the owners of food bars a long hot summer could not come at a more bad time and only time will tell whether the necessary recovery will bring the more moderate temperatures that we experienced in August.”
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2.7% in July, indicating a slow introduction of brands.

One in five children has a secret account on the social network that he hides from his parents
The study showed that one in five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — had a secret account on the social network that he hides from his parents and teachers
Survey of 20,000 students showed the growth of fake Instagram pages
The news strengthened fears about publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students said that they have a “main” account dedicated to parents
One in five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — creates an account on social networks that he hides from his parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the rapid growth of false Instagram accounts.
The news strengthened fears about publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said that they manage the censored “main” account they show to their parents and have private bills.
A mother who accidentally stumbled upon the secret side of a 13 - year - old daughter noticed that she urged visitors to rape her.
A survey conducted by the Digital Awareness UK network and the Conference of Principals and Principals (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, half of which admit to having a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers succumb to temptation and create an online space where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the “Vote of athletes” on the Scottish Committee on athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletics committee as the non-executive director of the annual general assembly of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in the field and in the open, and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who direct sport to take advantage of its extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities. We believe that it would be a huge gain for athletics in Scotland by its inclusion in the committee,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am delighted to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope that I can really contribute and help run sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 metres of Olympic medals and 400 metres of Olympic games in 1996 in Atlanta and is now a regular BBC commentator, has lost his ability to speak after a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it would only take time to tell me if I could recover and to what extent.
The work has been exhausting, but I have recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I am performing agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
An ad for a breast pump that compares mothers to cows distributed online reviews
The company that produces breast pumps distributed opinions with an ad that compares mothers to cows in milking.
To launch the marketing of the "first silent portable breast pump", the consumer technology company Elvie published a provocative music video ad to show mothers all the freedom that the device allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in a barn filled with hay to a song that includes the following text: »Yes, I am pumping, but there is no tail,« and »In case you haven’t noticed, these aren’t my teats, these are my boobs«.
The collection continues: "Drain, exhaust, feed the fools, exhaust, exhaust, squeeze the breasts."
However, the advertisement published on Facebook’s website caused considerable disapproval on the Internet.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom said that it was joking at the expense of the dairy industry’s “creeps”.
“The use of cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they also become pregnant and born to produce milk, but their babies are stolen in the first days of their birth," wrote one.

The second commented: "Of course it is traumatic for both mother and cub.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who keep their children?«
Someone else added: "Advert completely without feeling."
Others praised the ad, and one of the women admitted that she thought the song "for fun" was hilarious.
»This seems like a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one, too, if I was still breast-feeding.
I felt just like a cow when I was pumping.
The ad is a little crazy, but I understood it the way it was meant to be.
This is a brilliant product,« wrote another.
Someone commented: "This is a funny ad that targets mothers who wear out milk (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like cows."
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they danced with hidden pumps in their bra.
The concept of action is that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump pump, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly into the breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move, hold the baby and even outdoor activities while pumping milk.
Ana Balarin, a mother’s partner and ECD, commented further. “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative presentation.”
By pulling the parallel between women who draw milk and dairy cows, we wanted to focus attention on pumping milk and all its challenges, while at the same time showing an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first case that Elvie's pump got on the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children took a walk on the modeling track for designer Marta Jakubowski when she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, even if the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively stable, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult for children to be handed over to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are undocumented migrants, and they fear that a request for a child would jeopardise their chances of staying in the country.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other household family members would have to submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior officer at the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of arrests did not have prior criminal records.
»Almost 80 percent of those who are sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of these are punished foreigners.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to deal with children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, and not after 60 days, which was the previous standard, said the workers at the shelter.
Many will appear with a video conference call, not personally, to defend themselves before the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for aid will be quickly expelled.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which, according to the workers in shelters and reports generated in the system in recent months, can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Advocates have said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornill, where signs of child distress due to their size are more likely to remain unnoticed.
They added that moving children to the city of tents without emotionally preparing them or giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to their friends could complicate the trauma that many of them face.
Syria urges the American, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even if the country had been at war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also performs the duties of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they “will also act accordingly”.
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he said to the Assembly.
Moualem said that the "war against terrorism" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to leave their homes, is "almost finished".
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until we cleanse the Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United Nations has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria who mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar Al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in the territory of this war - torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for them were appropriate for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "expanding irrational fears", which convinced refugees to stay abroad.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to their easier return,” he said.
"They are turning into a political issue, which should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that it will not receive reconstruction funds until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
According to United Nations diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last important base of rebels, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement prevented a massive attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and expressed the hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadiists, including Fronta Nusra fighters, associated with Al-Qaeda, who would be "extremely eradicated".
The United Nations ambassador, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene shortly the first meeting of the new committee, composed of members of the government and opposition, to prepare the post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Mr Moualem defined the Syrian Government's terms of participation in the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will achieve a second mandate
Following this conclusion, Mr Trump will win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, his presidency ends prematurely with an interpelling and scandal.
Which would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!"
So far, there's no sign of the audience's fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million at the time of maximum viewing, and MSNBC's ratings have almost tripled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time of the highest ratings, which is more than four years ago, when it was 1.7 million, and the show "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC has reached the highest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers on the night's important news.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, Head of the “Designed Survivor” drama, about the Cabinet Secretary, who becomes President after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned sound of comedy and the authors of the book »Only funny parts: and some hard truths about snooping at the Club of Hollywood Boys,« offers a different explanation.
Remember the taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’ Mrs. Scovell told me.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what appears to be on television, the Washington story could decide the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, given whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Shutdown is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the six-hour viewing of the round table of experts discussing the use of the source “deep background” for the book “Fears” by Bob Woodward, $15,000 worth of ostrich leather jackets (“dress, thick-puffed,” said the newspaper The Washington Post) and the consequences of shocking descriptions of Trumpe, khm, anatomy.
Sam, for example, I'll never look at Super Maria the same way again.
“The part of his performance that gives the impression of a reality show is that every night he offers something,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show Pawn Stars on Trump's show and the daily twists of the script (two with N.F.L., praise Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, or you'll find yourself behind schedule.
When I was talking to Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, there were about 80 degrees (26.7 °C), but he was stuck inside watching MSNBC when CNN was filming.
He couldn't possibly break apart, even when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Council and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the air.
“I remember that we were making all these crazy shows at the time and people were saying, ‘This is the end of Western civilization’,” said Mr. Fleischman.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

External money is being prepared for the closest interim parliamentary elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania District has seen a flood of money, as the reorganization of congress districts has put two candidates in a race for the same seat.
This recently divided suburban district of Pittsburgh is home to the Democratic representative of Conor Lamb, who won his seat in the special elections this spring in another district.
Lamb competes with another candidate, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th District, which overlaps strongly with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrafted when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally drawn for the benefit of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district has touched on the struggle to finance the campaign between the main party financial bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March special elections for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat was occupied by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political commentators attach a slight advantage to the Democrats.
In the United States, sanctions against El Salvador were considered for supporting China, and then they withdrew.
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already admitted Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners banished the leadership of the Trump organization.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic mission leaders in El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama, “a recent decision to end the recognition of Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, representing the Ministry at the beginning of the month.
However, sanctions were considered for El Salvador, which is estimated to receive USD 140 million in US aid in 2017, including aid to combat narcotics trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included a limitation on financial assistance and a targeted restriction on the issuance of visas, would have a major impact on this Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference dedicated to security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration in the direction of the United States.
By mid - September, the highest government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, ending their reflections on penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing the participants of the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance that the US Government attaches to the meeting, has been added to diplomats.
Three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A representative of the White House for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss them under the condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the government and who also spoke about it under the condition of anonymity.
Historical Comparisons
Another unpleasant news could be the report by special adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice, which is now very much evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller is also supposed to direct the investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was involved with Russia's attack on the American elections.
If Congress changes its hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer before that authority and perhaps even before a jury of his colleagues at the very moment he's preparing to speak to his constituents again.
There are many questions about this, and I do not wish to say that Mr Trump's fall is imminent, and neither are his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight could be.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to strike against Hitler if the West rebelled against him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
At such turning points, the course of history is changing and accelerating or slowing down the relentless march of democracy.
The Americans are facing a number of such turning points right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed a secret recording of the president and speculated on his inadequacy for this position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the report of The Times was inaccurate.
“How will we react if the requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair, or if he is appointed supreme judge despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, are we going to vote in the interim elections for Congress, which will require Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she told me to light the Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?«

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and it is clear that the victory over the Austrians after the impressive Remi against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month will place them in a convincing position to qualify from the G Group of the European League.
The damage to the knee prevented Graham Dorans from appearing for the first time in the season before the 2-2 against Villarreal Remi, but he believes that the Rangers can use this as a jump point for greater achievements.
“This was a point for us, as Villarreal is a strong team,” said a 31-year-old.
»We entered the game in the belief that we can achieve something and take away the point.
Perhaps we could win a victory in the end, but in general, remi is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up, and we were better off in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because in the last game they have achieved a good result, but with the crowd behind us I am sure that we can make an effort to achieve a positive result.
Last year has certainly been difficult, given everything that has happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I feel good about this place now.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind and achieve success.”
Women's poor sleep because of their fear of savings
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people share this with their family members.
Half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said that they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the life insurance sector at Nationwide.
You can start as follows.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not talk to them in time.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you want to receive care, as this may be an important factor in the cost assessment.
Include a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and a life insurance policy to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own resources, if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles on transition.
Choose a health representative by identifying a trusted person who will supervise your health care and ensure that professionals respect your health needs if you are unable to communicate.
Consider, too, authorising a person to finance his own finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in urgent need of medical attention and is on her way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?

The shooter, in his 40s, was in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot several times in the chest, abdomen, and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place at approximately 2.30 a.m. British time, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have asked any witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the number of victims was said to be increasing.
In the event of communications being interrupted, rescuers from the Regent of Donggal, a region north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the 7,5 magnitude earthquake, were unable to obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the earthquake.
Some key information about Palu and Donggala in Sulavezi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulavezija, a province located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulaveza and is estimated to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala is a landscape that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline on the north-west of the island of Sulaveza.
The Regent, an administrative unit under the province, was estimated to have a population of 299000 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the Central Sulavezi province are aquaculture and farming, especially in the Central Region of Donggal.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but mostly in Morovian, on the opposite side of Sulavezija.
Palu and Donggala have been repeatedly affected by the tsunami in the last 100 years by the Indonesian Agency for the Mitigation of Natural Disasters.
In 1938, the tsunami caused the death of over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, the tsunami also struck northern Donggala and caused the death of nine people.
Since Indonesia sits on the seismic - active Pacific Fire Ring, earthquakes occur regularly here.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province of Indonesia, northern Sumatra, on 26 December, caused a tsunami affecting 14 countries that killed 226.000 people along the coast of the Indian assessment, more than half of which occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit Western Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the southern part of Java, the most populated Indonesian island, and triggered a tsunami that flooded its southern coast and caused the death of nearly 700 people.
2009: The earthquake of magnitude 7.6 took place near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
Over 1,100 people have died.
2010: The earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and caused the death of some 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake struck the Regent of Pidie Jay in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, the tsunami was not triggered, but over 100 people were killed by the fallen buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and caused the death of more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily held thousands of tourists.
Arresting the eldest son of Sarah Palin for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor and vice president's candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
A 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of the report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, a police agency called Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, when Palin tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, she took the phone out of her hand.
The Palina was detained at the Mat-Su Pre-Criminal Foundation and is in custody under an unsecured guarantee of USD 500, reported the KTUU television network.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "certainly innocent" when he was asked about the defence, the network reported.
The Palina has been charged with three Class A offences, which means he could be arrested for up to one year and fined at $250,000.
He was also accused of one class B offence, punishable by one day in prison and a fine of USD 2000.
Palin's crime isn't the first time he's been charged.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference with the report of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholised state in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin criticised veteran groups when she associated her son's violent behaviour with post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Tsunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
The Earthquake of magnitude 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are being cut off and the number of fatalities is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to Central Sulavezi, located northeast of Indonesia’s capital city, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of the earthquake.
When the tsunami hit the beach, hundreds of people were present in the city of Palu at the beach festival.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sajful Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City, in which eight people died, a rare sentence that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was to use a rented truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle route along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, when several pedestrians and cyclists were hit in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, as stated in the notification of the death penalty claim lodged in the South District of New York.
According to court documents, any charge of death could be the cause of death.
Several weeks after the attack, the great federal jury informed Saipov of the 22 counts that included eight counts of murder in support of the extortion commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and the charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required »significant planning and intent«, said prosecutors, who described Saip’s way as »suspicious, cruel and depraved«.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernano Ferruchi, Hernano Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” states the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court of the South District issued the final death penalty ten years ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, and finally, in September 2009, his sentence was turned into a life sentence.
The death penalty was last imposed in the city of New York in a federal case in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no regret in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
After the charge, he told the Saip authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by the ISIS videos he had seen on his phone.
The police also said that he had requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
On 22 counts of charges, he pleaded innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were “apparently disappointed” by the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of being released for everyone involved will only prolong the suffering of these events,” said Patton.
Saipo's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
NIGEEL FARAGEA, says the Torian Member, should be tasked with negotiating the Brexite.
Nigel Farage today, during a protest at the Tory Conference, promised to "mobilize the People's Army".
A former leader of Ukipa said that politicians must "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics when one of their own Members proposed that it should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
On the march in Birmingham, a Conservative Member, Peter Bone, said that if the United Kingdom were Mr Farage's Secretary for Brexit, the United Kingdom would "be out by now".
However, the challenge faced by Mrs Mayeva in coordinating their deeply divided species was highlighted by the Torians who were in favour of giving up the Brexite, who joined a separate protest against Brexite in the city.
The Prime Minister seeks to maintain her plan in the tracks during the attacks of Brexite, Brexite opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that Mayeva would try to reach an agreement in Brussels despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between their package and the 'kaos'.
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave convention in Solihull that "he wants to get rid of Chequers".
He said that Mr Farage should be appointed as the interlocutor and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,” he said.
This Member from Wellingborough added: "I will support the brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
He described his opposition to the EU in the following words: "We did not fight in world wars to be servants now.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected the proposals that public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely untrue."
There was also Torian Brexitarian Andrea Jenkyns at the meeting, who said to the rapporteurs: “I simply say: ‘The President of the Ministry, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is also unpopular with our party and our activists, who are active on the streets and lead us to election at all.
Please abandon Chequers and start listening.””
In a message addressed to Mrs Mayeve, she added: “Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
At the meeting, Mr Farage said that politicians should be given a "sense of heat" if they intend to issue a decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“It is now a matter of trust between us — the people — and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray the Brexite, and today we are gathered here to tell them, “We will not let you do this.”
In his message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of issuing brexito, to feel the heat."
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country, which has assured us of victory at Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham, where they held a two - hour meeting in the city center.
After the group was formed, a handful of activists waved the flags of the Tories against Brexite this weekend.
The Labour nobler Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives because of security problems in the use of the party application after the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for a border without congestion, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
»This is a complete farce.
There is nothing like a good brexit," he added.
Warren's potential competition for president's position will be "exactly examined"
According to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, “participation in the race for the Presidential City will be carefully examined” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe journal reports that a Massachusetts democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will compete for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, co-chaired by Trump's election campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is at the heart of speculation to deal with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a "town hall" since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she intended to compete for the post of president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and correct our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top."
Arresting after death of a LSU Sims player in a shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that she had arrested a suspect for shooting an LSU Wayd Sims basketball player.
The Baton Rouge police station reported the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a press conference at 11 p.m. Eastern Time.
They released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man on the tape.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and killed early on Friday near the campus of South University.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died as a result," said Police Commissioner Murphy J. Paul to the media, reporting a network of 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
At the hearing, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene, that he had a weapon, and that he shot Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 198-inch junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 beginnings in the last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of World Champion, and the team ordered him to leave the victory to Sebastian Vettl.
On Saturday it became clear that Valtteri Boltas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton that "the Mercedes team will have a major impact on the race".
Bottas started well at the start and almost left Hamilton on dry land, defending his position in the first two turns and inviting Vettle to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to drive into the pit and let Hamilton drive on the tail of traffic, which should be decisive.
Mercedes drove into the pit later and left him behind Vettle, but after some driving action, Hamilton noticed that Ferrari's dislike left the inside open and risks falling behind after two defensive moves in the third corner.
Max Verstappen began with the last kind of network and was in seventh place on his 21st birthday by the end of the first round.
After that, most of the game is without changing tires, as he intended to make a quick finish, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take the fourth place.
He finally drove into the pit in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could not increase speed, so he took the fourth place Raikkonen.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri drove fantastically all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he let me pass.
The team did a really great job in order to reach the first and second place," said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at the meeting on Saturday for her insistence that she did not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly touch Ford's testimony before the Senate's inquiry commission, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "evil, corrupt and lying".
»The only beautiful thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last days, which we can see anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and lying,« he said.
“When you look at the posts and the revelations, people say “No, I didn’t do it”.
I didn’t do it.”
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal this?
Remember her answer... you revealed the document – ‘Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not reveal it.”
All right, hold on a second.
We revealed it ... No, we did not,« he added regarding the impression of the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and it was disclosed to the media in early September — but Feinstein denies it came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t reveal her letter,” according to The Hill Feinstein’s report, she told the commission.
"She asked me for confidentiality, and I kept it confidential, as she asked."
But her denial did not seem to fit the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday night: "I tell you, this was a really bad body language.
It may not be, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.«
In the defense of a candidate for the Supreme Court who was accused by three women of inappropriate sexual conduct, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by every means possible.
You have seen evil, abomination, they don't care who they hurt or who they have to run down to get through to power and control," said the President after reporting the Mediaite website.
Elite League: Dundee Stars v Belfast Giants 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for a loss on Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the Saturday game in Dundee at 5:3 p.m.
Giants were early in the lead for two goals on Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie evened the home page, and then Dwyer regained the advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard evened the Dundees before two Lundvald Nielsen goals guaranteed them victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who defeated the Dundee 2:1 on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams and the Giants won the previous three matches.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the game in the fourth minute at 3:35 at Kendall McFaulle's assistance, and David Rutherford passed the ball to Beauvillere, who scored four minutes later.
In the intense opening part, at 1:10 p.m., Sullivan reinstated his homepage, and Matt Marquardt gave Cowni a 3:16 tie.
Dwyer took care of the Giants' lead on the break when he hit his second goal at the end of the first third.
The homepage gathered again, and Bouchard made up for the delay with a fierce goal of 2737.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to lead the Dundee in the lead at the end of the second third and to win with the fifth goal of their halftime team and to win with the fifth goal of their team in the middle of the last third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play the next game on Friday at their home in Milton Keynes.
With its death, the air traffic controller has enabled hundreds of people on board to escape the earthquake.
The air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after sacrificing his life so that a plane with hundreds of people could take off safely.
Over 800 people died in the Friday earthquake on the island of Sulaveza, followed by a tsunami, and many are missing.
The area continues to be shaken by strong aftershocks, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his associates fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his post in a highly rocking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He stayed there so that the flight Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower because he thought he was breaking down.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian media house ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pal.
»Our hearts are torn when we hear it,« he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, as the Agency for Disaster Mitigation in the country has said that access to cities in Donggala, Sigi and Boutonga is limited.
“The number of deaths is expected to increase, as many bodies were under the ruins, but many of them could not be reached,” said a representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Palu, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, was devastated by waves of up to six metres [6 m] high.
Military and commercial planes bring help and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said of Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives the bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water.
Minimarkets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said of CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse.”
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo and addressed the National Army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?« according to CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
The crash of the micronesian plane: Air Niugini now says that after the plane crashes in the lagoon, one man is missing.
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one person is missing after the initial announcement that all 47 passengers and crew have been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini announced on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline reported that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the missing person.
They did not respond immediately to the call for more information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, officials said that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that there were eight passengers left at the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have reported that the plane landed in a lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went down very low.
"This is extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that along with the other passengers, he was able to get through to the belt of reaching water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the stewardesses panicked and screamed, but he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were nearby repairing the pier also came to the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank into about 30 metres (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in the last two decades in air accidents in Papua New Guinea, but this is the first accident that occurred to Air Niugini.
The analyst determined the time of night when the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The analyst at the U.S. Justice Department Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used phone records to determine the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers' house at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said, "He was lying because [my] truck was in Nashville."
The second inconsistency was that Tellis said that when she died, he knew Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at the time of Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is expected to present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that a jury was to judge the trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
Hiphop trio wants to provoke a negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed Group of Bristol claims that hiphop has strayed from its original political and social engagement.
They want to go back to his roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a rise with artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman? !
The New York Nanny is suing the couple for firing her for a "racist" message.
The New York nanny is suing the couple for discriminatoryly firing her after receiving a wrongly sent message from her mother who complained that she was "another black woman."
The couple denies the growthist behaviour and compares the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed disappointment in 2016, when she discovered that she was a black woman when the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived.
“NEEEEEEEEE ONE MONEY,” wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman in her husband’s message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After the discovery of her failure, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "uncomfortable", forgave Mrs. Maurice, who said that her outgoing nanny, who was African-American, was doing a bad job and wanted to hire a Filipino woman, reported a New York Post newspaper.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for a day's work, and then she was sent home with Uber.
Maurice now claims compensation from a couple in court, amounting to USD 350 per day for a period of six months for the work for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
»I want to show them, you know, things like this don't happen,« she said about Post on Friday, adding: »I know it's discrimination.«
The couple responded to the charges of racism by claiming that Maurice’s forgiveness was reasonable because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after the insult.
»My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told us about the Post.
»Would you be willing to trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if this happened by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on.«
When comparing the lawsuit with "emigration", Plasco said that his wife had a child only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Will you take it out on someone like that?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although proceedings are still pending before the court, the court of public opinion quickly condemned a couple on social networks for their conduct and thinking.
The publishers of Paddington’s story feared that readers would not connect to a talking bear, revealed a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It was difficult to put yourself in the skin of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very fun to find out now that Paddington has become a great hit.”
She said that her father, who initially worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write a children's book about a small toy bear, would be indignant when he refused to do his job, she added that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book was "bitter-sweet".
As regards the bear Paddington, she described him as “a very important member of our family”, she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a quiet man who didn’t like to brag,” she said.
»But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if something had been achieved by your child: You are proud of him, even if you are not really doing it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, success was always attributed to the bear Paddington himself.«
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good-bye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to preserve her life in vain.
“She called regularly to say that she felt really bad, that she didn’t expect it to happen,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nadia, and he told me that she would die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep pumping her heart slowly faded and left her system.
She's been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
All I had to do was sit and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation with my family and people around me.
I really had to endure.”
Finally, Mrs Ednan Laperouse, who has now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, unaware of the trial she is undergoing.
»Nobody knew,« she said.
"I had my head down, and tears were running down my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving female beauty posters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide try to discourage others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Welsh Bridge are putting up posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs Tyler's son was 13 when he fell into depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile enlightened every room.”
But before he died, he stopped working because he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his sibling when he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that the domino effect will be triggered."
Mrs. Davis made posters “to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t sit in silence – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a friend of Davies's for many years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, depressed or otherwise,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day he was completely down. When the children opened the presents, he did not establish eye contact with them or anything.”
She said that his death was a serious trauma to them, but they had to process it: »She cut a hole in the whole family.
She broke us up.
But we must continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs at the start of an FBI investigation in the air.
“I thought that if we could actually carry out what he asked for – in terms of duration and scope, this might unify us,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world was falling apart because of a strong party jam.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time during which the investigation would take place.
The interim elections, which will take place on 6 November, are only five weeks away – if the Republicans are expected to do badly, this will greatly weaken them in trying to elect the desired person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush phoned senators several times to lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, who presented him to his current wife, Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares the report?
A vote will be held in a Senate currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can raise at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would lead to a breakthrough for Mike Pence, the vice president, from the stalemate and the election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean fugitives fell below Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean Member.
According to Byeong-seug Park, referring to South Korean Uniting Department data, 1127 people escaped last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were stronger border controls between North Korea and China and the price increases demanded by smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made a public comment.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily secured demilitarised area between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
North-South relations – which are technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Early this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations.
This took place after the June historic meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed to pursue a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Jong-ho, attributed a stalemate to American sanctions since then.
“Without confidence from the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not disarm unilaterally,” said Mr Ri in the address of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi described Brett Kavanaugh as "hysteric" and said that he was unfit to serve at the Supreme Court.
The minority leader of Nancy Pelosi’s representative home described Brett Kavanaugh’s candidate as “hysterical” and said that her character was inappropriate for serving in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said so in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can only imagine that if a woman behaved like this, she would be described as “hysteric”,” Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate committee of inquiry was commented by Pelosi on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has been furiously denying the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening recital, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he almost screamed and choked on his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats in the Commission and described the charges against himself as "gross and coordinated blasphemy" organised by the Liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the Presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he should not be appointed supreme judge, because it showed that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
“I believe that he discredited himself with such statements and the way he dealt with Clinton and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi asked if she would try to make a constitutional accusation against Kavanaugh if it was confirmed and the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives for a moment.
»I will say this – if the Congress or the FBI is not telling the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court but also for the court in which it is now,« said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi said that as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decision of Kavanaugh against the Accessible Health Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade case as a conservative judge.
In his confirmatory hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would have annulled certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’ said Pelosi.
And a woman needs to be wielded.
It's a righteous outcry, after months and years of rage, and it can't express it without crying.
»We cry when we are angry,« said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's very rare, do you?"
She went on to say, "I was very helped by a woman who was somewhere a director who also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I am angry.”
Then she simply continued.
I thought that was top-notch.”
Tears are partly allowed as a way out of rage because people misunderstand them.
One of the strongest memories of my early career when I was still working in an office dominated by men, where I once found myself weeping in unspeakable rage, is an event when an older woman grabbed my neck — a cold leader who was always a little afraid, dragging me down the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They won’t understand that you’re angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to see you get beat up.«
Patricia Schroeder, former Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught cheating in a boat called Monkey Business and had to get out of the game, Mrs. Schroeder found that there was no reason why she could not run for president on her own.
“It was not a well thought out decision,” she laughed at me 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates participating in the match, and another was the last necessary thing at the time.
Someone named the match “Snow and seven Dwarfs” at the time.«
Since she was the last one to join the campaign, she was lagging behind in raising funds, so she decided not to enter the game if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, gave her only $250.
»Do they think I'll get a discount?« she wondered.
When she announced that she would not start an official campaign, her feelings — gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made it so difficult for her to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism — overcome her so much that she began to choke.
“You would think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder remembered the reaction of the media.
»You'd think my official sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my tombstone.
“Did she cry?”
How could the war between the United States and China benefit Beijing?
The beginnings of the US-China trade war were deafening, and although the battle is not over long ago, experts say that the division between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, set off the first warning at the beginning of the year by taxing key Chinese export items, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs for goods worth USD 200 billion (GBP 150 billion), which effectively means the taxation of half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time with equivalent reprisals, most recently with tariffs ranging from 5 to 10 percent on US goods worth USD 60 billion.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed itself to eye-to-eye against the United States and is unlikely to blink soon.
In order to give in to Washington, China would have to agree to its demands, but the public submission of the US to Chinese President Shi Jinping would be too shameful.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing is able to pull the right moves, the pressure of the US in the trade war could have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger an economic shock in any of the countries is, in fact, far more dangerous than the observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, an expert partner focusing on Asia at the Brain Trust Center for New American Security.
Syria is “prepared” for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and asks for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to repair areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
All the conditions are now met for refugees to return to the country voluntarily, which they had to leave for terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding a devastated country.
However, he pointed out that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
By winning against the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National course in Paris, France, the team won the Ryder Cup for 2018.
The United States has now lost six in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown when the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had a problem through most of the championship, threw a ball in the water at the 16th hole in a couple-3 game at his initial hit, making him turn the game over to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined through all the circles and became one of the four players who ever since the start of the championship in its current form in 1979 achieved the score of 5-0-0.
With 5 and 4, the American Jordan Spieth defeated the lowest-ranking European team player, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked actor, Dustin Johnson, lost two and one against Ian Poulter from England, who may have played in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
The eight Ryder Cup Veteran, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the world's most victorious European player at the championship of all time at 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for picking me up and believing in me.
So happy, I'm so happy we won the Cup again.
It's a team, and I'm really glad I could help,« said Garcia emotionally after the European victory.
He handed over the relay to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated the American legend of Tiger Woods golf on Sunday with 2 and 1.
“I feel incredibly proud that I managed to defeat Tiger Woods. As I grew up, I watched his games,” said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record in the Ryder Cups 13-21-3.
It's an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 big titles right after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the whole week helplessly trying to find the right way, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the entire championship.
After a bad show for his team, the American captain said, "I'm so proud of these guys, they fought."
We put some pressure on Europe for a moment this morning.
We failed.
A hat down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're gonna have to regroup, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're gonna move on.
I really love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
Put your hat down.
We've been overplayed.«
