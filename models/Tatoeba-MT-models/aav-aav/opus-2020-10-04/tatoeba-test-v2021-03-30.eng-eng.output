She's not a good cook.
Tom said he wasn't in any hurry.
I know Tom doesn't know who's doing it.
I don't know you're not Canadas.
Come to watch us play music sometimes.
Tom said he understood why Mary didn't want to do that.
Tom said Mary was too busy to help you do that today.
Tom told me he'd complain about that.
Tom's a member of my co-op.
Tom drove down the street that Mary lives on, hoping to see her.
I'm sure it's not hard to do that.
You know as well as I do that no chance that Tom would do that.
Tom's not sure whether he should kiss Mary or not, so he's not.
I know Tom might need to do it by myself.
Tom doesn't seem to be doing what he was supposed to be doing.
It would have been tiring to do that.
Tom must have told us the truth.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
We'll have to do something.
When did you plan to do that?
Tom said he didn't believe Mary was planning to do that week.
Tom knows he'd be punished.
I don't think I've seen anyone doing that before.
That's not difficult.
I'm afraid we don't have any left.

We haven't done yet.
I've never been to Paris.

I'm sure Tom will be back.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary went on October 20th.
I know Tom knows he doesn't have to do that.
Why are everyone staring at us?
I know Tom doesn't know who did that to Mary.
I reason Tom did that because everyone else in his family did.
Everybody knows I don't like Tom.
Tom told me that he thought Mary didn't know how to play the oboe.
I'd like to use this opportunity to thank you.
I would have left early if I could.
I know I have to do that before Tom gets here.
I don't think you'd enjoy doing that.
Tom didn't talk to Mary about that yet.
I don't think Tom's beautiful.
Tom is the only one who's sleeping.

I never should have let you go home alone last night.
I think I'm gonna have a chance to do that day after tomorrow.

I know Tom's scared.
You can't appreciate the song until you have read it many times.
I'm actually trying to do that.
Tom never should have left early.
She's already married.
This is blasphemy!
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't awake.
Tom said he was glad he was able to do that.
You can't buy one of those for less than thirty dollars.
Do you think Tom wants to go to Australia with us?

I don't think I'll be as early as I'm today.
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit he's wrong.
How many yards are it from here to the sớm station?
I don't think that story is true.
He often adopted the behavior and speech pattern that characterizes the advantaged.
Tom said you were his friend.
I'm thinking about having dinner at six.
Tom told Mary he'd be doing that tomorrow.
I know Tom is through.
Tom said Mary's dog bit him.

He's very attached to her.

I'm telling you we have to assume Tom is dead.
Mary's got a hairdresser's appointment.
Tom said Mary thought she might be allowed to do that today.
If you don't want to come, you don't have to.
It smells like someone who has been smoking a cigar in here.
We're just in time for the last train.
I think that question isn't appropriate.
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a kid?
I don't think anyone notice what we're doing.

You know I don't have a car.
There's a big supermarket.
I suspected Tom was discouraged.
I'm sure Tom won't force anyone to do that.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not be allowed to do that.
I would have done the same thing Tom did.
Are you sure no one can see us?
There's no solution to this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom's gonna be busy tomorrow.
I suspect Tom may not have enough money to buy everything he wants.
Did he touch you?
Tom and Mary said they were soon doing that.
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs.
Today's the twentieth of October.
Tom and Mary said they were planning on going.
I hope Tom saw what Mary did.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's not Canada.
Africa is not a country.
Tom wasn't the one who told me he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree to do that.
I don't have kids.
I know Tom forgot to do that.
I know you want to be happy.
I think that book is not so interesting.
I'm told that it's not a good idea.
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team is going to continue to get better.
I wish someone would help me with that.
Tom certainly knows he shouldn't be doing that.
Tom doesn't think Mary and I can take care of myself.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
It's a big responsibility.
I think you should turn yourself in.
I wonder whether Toms enjoys doing that.
Tom said he thought Mary was too old to do that.
I should have known that I couldn't trust Tom.
I don't know you and Tom work together.
No one will know I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.
Tom said he thought I needed to get more exercise.
Tom told me he'd try to do that.
Tom and Mary know they shouldn't do that.
Tom said Mary thinks he might be required to do that next time he travels.
I know Tom is the one who should have told Mary she shouldn't.
Tom said he knew I might need to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they weren't coming back.
Tom doesn't know Mary's in love with someone else.
I don't think Tom's concerned.
I wish I had a chance to learn French in high school.
It's clear that Tom was supposed to help us do that.
I know Tom's gonna be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in jail.
Tom said Mary thinks he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom said he wouldn't win.
It's possible Tom may not know I'm here.
Do you think I'm weird?
Tom thinks he knows it all.
Tom said it's not gonna end well.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't do that today.
I thought we had something to give Tom.
The pupils did the work itself.
Tom and Mary said they didn't mind doing that.
You'll stay here until you're taken.
My daughter's being a toilet trained.
Tom said he didn't think Mary could have done that.
Tom and Mary told me they were feeling good.
They say they're not ready to go.
Something happened to him.
No one suspected anything like this.
Tom was drunk and said what he shouldn't have said.
I don't know that Tom and Mary used to be married to each other.
Tom and Mary told me they never met you.
I think Tom is a pretty painter.
I know Tom's a picker and try something new.
Tom said he did nothing illegal.
I doubt Tom knows that Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore.
I know Tom doesn't love me.
I know Tom knows how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
She's still chatting away.
You're a nerd.
Everybody's late except me.
He can't resist the temptation.
Tom would probably get angry if you did that.
I think Tom would agree to do that.
I'm a libertarian.
May I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom can help us.
I don't think I've met anyone like you.
Tom said he didn't want to do that today.
I don't think Tom's gonna have to do it alone.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
My ears are not as good as it used to be.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom accepted that he was rude.
You'll have a hard time.
I should have let Tom speak to you first.
Tom is now in Australia or in New Zealand.
I don't think we should be talking about that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Don't you know you're not supposed to be there?
I know Tom is a little older than Mary.
Tom didn't know someone was hired to kill him.
Tom told me he couldn't eat peanuts.
I don't think Tom would enjoy doing that.
Tom said he thought I wouldn't have to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me he thought he could do that.
Tom said he suspected Mary was very excited to do that.
Am I the only one who's confused?
I know Tom is a bully.
He's a smartest boy.
How's your father?
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me he thought Mary was home.
I hope Tom doesn't become jealous.
I'm pretty sure that's not what Tom means.
It won't be hard for us to do that.
Tom said Mary didn't look tired to him.
I doubt Tom will ever be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary say they're not planning on going.
I think Tom has a plan.
It's not what it looks like.
They said they were comfortable.
Tom said he never planned on living in Australia for so long.
Tom told me he didn't really want to go to Boston.
Tom has more books than you do.
I know Tom is about the same height as you are.
There's no excuse for his delay.
Tom must have been the one who put the drugs in my pocket.
Tom says he's glad Mary's not hurt.
Tom asked Mary if she'd read the book he'd lend her.
I wake up at seven o'clock.
I could have done that, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary haven't told anyone they're getting married yet.
They said they planned on Monday.
It's not going to be easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't speak so fast, please.
They told me they had bacon and eggs for breakfast.
Tom didn't tell anyone they had to do that.
I think Tom paid too much for that old saxophone.
Tom says he's all out.
Tom told me he thought Mary was busy.
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary should.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was finished.
I thought you had to work.
Tom said he didn't have anything he needed.
You should have stayed where you were.
I'll miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary say they're trying to lose weight.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was ឈ្មោះless.
Tom said he could wait, but Mary couldn't.
Tom could have stoned himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my lesson.
Tom must be right.
You know I'm the only one who can do that, don't you?
Tom said he didn't think he could do that without our help.
Tom thinks Mary's not awake.
Did anyone hug Tom?
Tom told me he loved my idea.
I know you're just doing it to annoy me.
That's a mistake.
One way is not better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Is anyone afraid?
Tom thinks he can do whatever he sets his mind.
We've been married seven years ago.
I could have done that better than Tom did.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please, don't be angry with me!
I don't think Tom could have done that better.
I know Tom didn't do that right.
She's in a bad mood.
I don't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary's better in France than she's really.
I'm free tonight.
Do you think Tom would have done that?
That's his house.
I'm home.
You don't need to pay for lunch.
Maybe I should have tried harder.
I thought Tom was going to do that today.
They promised they'd check on it.
I'm sure Tom would have agreed.
Tom and Mary said they don't like to do that.
Tom said he knew he might have to do it by himself.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It's not the last goal, but the process of getting there is that matter.
Tom must have put a fight.
Tom said he wanted to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think there's a chance that Tom might get hurt.
Tom said he was happy that you did it.
I always knew that Tom was a troublemaker.
Well, I'm never!

I just want you to know I support you.

We're all in the grave.
Why would anyone care what Tom thinks?
I've got a hard-bopped eggs for myself.
You got a pen with you?
I don't think Tom will be in Australia next summer.
Tom and Mary may not be able to buy everything they need for $300.

With his last breath, he told him he was adopted.
I know Tom is a really close friend of Mary's.
I know Tom didn't know who was supposed to do that.
Tom thinks we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wouldn't do that?
I know Tom wouldn't agree to do that.
Tom shut down his computer.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
It's obviously Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom and Mary say they don't believe John was planning on doing that.
Tom could have asked me first.
You're not really suggesting that I'm out with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that as soon as I should.
I don't think Tom's bossy.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you the keys.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she didn't.
I would have done it by myself if Tom didn't help me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plan.
How did you tell someone that?
Tom told Mary he thought John wasn't hungry.
I thought Tom already knew that.
Tom told me he thought Mary did it.

That guy over there reminds me of someone I used to know.
Tell them I'll come.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I told Tom I needed to do that.
I plan to stay at home all Monday.
I'd rather do this alone.
Tom is the only one who could have stolen Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready.
No one's against Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom is used by what's going on?
We haven't started to fight yet.
Who's typing on the door?
I think Tom is the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
They say they're supporting.
I thought that would be a great idea.
What you said to shock everyone.
Tom and Mary told me they were ambidextical.
Tom said he thought what Mary did was a mistake.
I hope no one comes.
I thought everyone could do that.
I think we'll be back soon.
Tom said he thought Mary was in her bedroom.
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anyone.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Tom told me it didn't matter.

I'm twelve.
I'd forget about that.
Tom told everyone he was through it.
They think there's no hope.
Tom said Mary didn't want to do that again.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were happy.
I thought you said you were glad you didn't do that.
Tom can speak French a little bit.
I know Tom's a lot taller than me.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I can't make sure that's going to happen.
I know Tom's not very busy.
I don't think I've seen Tom with Mary.
I know Tom is quicker at doing that rather than Mary.
Tom said he thought Mary could not be required to do that again.
You're not worried about the test, are you?
Tom said he was willing to help me do that.
I told you I don't know if Tom would tell the truth or not.
Everybody's got a good time.
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said he did.
Both Tom and Mary want to do that.
You shouldn't use someone else's toothbrush.
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John loves Alice.
I wonder if Tom would be able to do that.
Tom thinks it's hard.
We walked around the lake.
I don't think it's gonna be hard to convince Tom.
They said they didn't work on Mondays.
I don't think Tom's as rich as most people think he's.
You'll do nothing like that.
You're so hot!

I know Tom knows I want to do that.
I wonder if Tom's safe.
I know Tom doesn't know that he shouldn't be doing it here.
Did Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done that yet.
Tom said he felt like he did it.
I don't understand how this could happen.
You're as tall as my sister.
Tom has read a lot of books about that.
I think Tom's done enough.
You know anybody in Boston?
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you would be happy to see me.
Tom acknowledged he was the one who stole Mary's money.
Tom and Mary were told they had to do that.
We better tell others.
Why is everyone talking about Tom?

Tom and Mary will do whatever you ask them to.
I know Tom can save himself a lot of time by just doing it.
Tom said he was hoping he and Mary could sing together.
I said nothing, and that makes him angry.
When will he be done?
You're a very nasty boy.
Tom's plan on doing that in the near future.
We're late.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A plate of pilaf with some kebabs is heaven on earth.
Tom and Mary told Tom that they were planning on doing that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary could do that or not.
Who sent letters by mail? These days we have e-mails.
If something sounds too good to be true, then it's probably.
Tom says he hopes that you won't want to do that.
Tom said he wished he wasn't there.
I thought you said you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they weren't in any hurry.
We might need to be in Australia for weeks.
I didn't plan to do that, but I can if you really want me to.
I don't think Tom knows who can do that.
Tom said he expected Mary to join.
I swim every day.
Who's the lucky guy?
They pretended they didn't know me.
I know Tom is a little shorter than Mary.
Tom will do that if no one stops him.
I'm sure Tom will refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
You know Tom and I'm not going to do that, don't you?
Tom and Mary told me they were done by 2:30.
I'm sure we should have left there.
Everybody knows Tom's speaking good Gauw.
I thought maybe you wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he forgot something.
She doesn't like snakes and math.
I know Tom didn't want to do that, but he did it anyway.
Tom's really got a lot on his plate at the moment.
I know Tom knows who needs to do that.
I don't think you should drive.
Let's hope that changes today.
It's not fair.
That's not exactly what I said.
They put their books down.
I know Tom is a better driver than I am.
I thought you loved Tom.
That's not possible with the current technology.
They say they're trying to be sore.
Tom said everyone in his office spoke French.
I wonder if Tom already told Mary not to do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do it by himself.
Tom and Mary said they were sick.
Tom said he wasn't allowed to do that.
I assume you're going somewhere with this.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was 30.
You have a sense of humour.
Tom said he thought he should learn how to do that.
It's not something I want to discuss.
I think Tom will refuse to do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed my help.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Can you cook a omelette?
Tom said he knew I was coming.
No one asked you to come here.
I wonder if Tom really kisses Mary last night.
We hope you'll be in Boston next spring.
You know I won't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk any more.
I wonder if we can do anything to help.
Tom said he'd be willing to help us do that.
I don't think Tom's capable of that.

Tom's dating a girl who's three years younger than he is.
I think Tom wouldn't refuse to do that.

Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I know Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think Tom would like this wine.
I believe we're on the phone.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that.
There's a certain amount of truth in what he's saying.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
I don't think Tom's a slob.
He's not a virtuoso.
I doubt Tom lied to me.
Tom will finally need to do that.
Tom told me he'd call at 2:30.
Tom hasn't told Mary what he had to do.
I know Tom is a good diver.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.
I know I should have stayed home.
I don't think this is enough food to feed all of us.
He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Tom said he planned to be a doctor.
I'm disappointed that my friends aren't here.
A sói can't be tamed.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think it's right.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom said he didn't do anything wrong.
Tom doesn't know what he should have done.
Tom said I should learn harder.
They say they'll hurt me.
I know Tom may be tempted to do that.
I'm not sure I can win this.
I'm afraid you won't get paid.
Are you worried that might happen?
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary did it.
Don't forget to take your umbrella when you leave here.
I'll see to it that's done.
I wear a suit but no tie.
I'm tired of you.
Tom thought he might be coming down with a cold.
I think Tom hates waiting for me.
I should have apologized right away.
You're lucky you don't get hurt.
Where does Tom and Mary plan to live?
This tree is more than a century old.
Tom doesn't want anyone to get mad.
I don't think that's the right thing to do.
Are you certain Tom would do that?

Give me some water.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be mad.
I don't think you're interested in.
We'll need more time.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's doing.
Tom said Mary's gonna do that tomorrow.
You're both welcome to come with us.
I can't believe Tom is actually doing that.
It's not something anyone can do.
Tom said he ate too much.
We're all looking forward to your coming.
I think Tom won't stop doing that soon.
Have I told you about the first time I met Tom?
I started studying French when I was old.
Tom said he wished he didn't play chess with Mary.
I know Tom would probably give you permission to do that.
Is it okay if I ask Tom to help me?
Tom said Mary knew John might not have had to do that by himself.
I wonder if Tom was moved.
Tom said he would have done that if he thought it was necessary.
Tom didn't know you were supposed to do that.
I think Tom wouldn't like it if Mary did it.
I still wish you would do that.
Mary let me know she's not planning to stay very long.
I don't know you're gonna be jealous.
Tom didn't know Mary had children.
They say they can't wait that long.
I'm surprised you don't know Tom doesn't want to do that.
Tom may be lonely.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't very busy.
I'm sure that's not going to happen.
I think he's right.
Tom said he was glad you did that for Mary.
I think Tom knows where Mary's going to do that.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's planning to do that.
Tom and Mary say they have to find someone to help them do it.
You're so upset.
I finished reading this book.
I know Tom won't be a very good teacher.
I don't know you're rich.
I should have told Tom to stay in Boston.
You've finished your training, haven't you?
What could have happened?
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary likes him or not.
I'm lost in the forest.
I know Tom's a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our band.
Tom told me he'd be in Boston next Monday.
Keep your mouth shut!
Tom said he knew he might need to do that on Monday.
Tom said he regrets what happened.
It's never too late to learn.
Tom didn't tell Mary he had to do that.
Tom knows Mary's sick.
You got a pen on you?
Tom lets Mary do what she wants to do.
I'll wait until 2:30.
My parents won't let me do that.
I don't think Tom knows how much time it will take for him to do that.
I don't think I want to do that here.
Why didn't you eat the food I cooked?
I know you're afraid of Tom.
Tom tried on his father's clothes.
I doubt Tom wouldn't tell Mary why he did it.

You've got a beautiful teeth!
No one knows that Tom is the one who contributes most of the money.
Everybody knows that Tom doesn't want to stay in Boston.
Tom said he didn't have to go to school tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was upset.
Tom and I were both confused.
I'm sure Tom knows that's going to happen.
Tom told me he thought he could do that.
I admit I did what Tom said I shouldn't.
Did you know that Tom and Mary had three children?
It's not just a little problem.
I'm not satisfied with your explanation.
I know Tom's done that.
I know you don't like me.
Tom said he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I know why Tom should have done that.
There must be a reason that Tom's not here.
It's not supposed to be late for a party.
Tom told me that he thought Mary could run faster than he could.
Tom said Mary was scared.
You should have been the last one to do that.
I know Tom's a farmer, but I don't know where his farm is.
Tom says it's urgent.
Tom said Mary doesn't like doing that.
What could go wrong?
No one could have stopped it.

That's not my pen.
I don't think I can do this without Tom.
Tom said he didn't think the noise bothered Mary.
No one's running.
Tom said Mary would do that.
I met someone who knows we.
Tom said he thought that shoes were too expensive.
Tom said he didn't have to do that.
It's just a joke.
Tom says he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same.
I should have brought more food.
I'm worried that Tom will be lost.
They told me they were next.
I doubt Tom and Mary are not as eager to do that now as they were yesterday.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have a chance to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary say they're not sluggish.
I know Tom did that to make Mary jealous.
I know you're smarter than that.
We're sorry for the inconvenience.
That's not the main reason I want to do that.
Tom didn't look back.
I know I'm bad.
Tom told me he called you.
I know Tom didn't know that you shouldn't have been doing it.

He's old enough to drive a car.

They hate foreigners; I hate everyone.

I don't know if Tom's coming tomorrow or not.
They said they were very busy.
I promise you we'll find a bigger place.
I think Tom is the only one who has to do that.
I don't think you won.
I don't think Tom would have time to do that with us today.
I know that Tom is very impressed.
We can't let these upstarts push us around.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's boyfriend is.
I know Tom knows who can do that and who can't.
Tom and Mary don't think they've ever met you.
Tom said Mary was worried about the weather.
Tom's not so sure.
Everyone here knows that we don't eat pork.
Let's hope that's the last time that happens.
I know Tom didn't know that you shouldn't have done that.
I think Tom doesn't know how to do that.
I told Tom I didn't plan to do that.
I thought it would be fun to live in Boston for a year or two.
It's not healthy to skip meals.
I'm happy to see you.
I know Tom can handle Mary.
I suspect Tom and Mary are those who did it.
I bet I can sit here longer without saying something more than you can.
It's not done yet.
I know Tom's not on the team anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't be doing that.
Tom just turned the radio on.
Tom already decided he wasn't going to say yes.
I know Tom is a bit snobish.
What's in the box?
Tom said Mary knew he might not want to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they weren't alone.
Tom said he would have done it by himself if he could.
Admise that there's a problem that's the first step to fix the problem.

Tom said Mary was lying.
I don't think Tom would be upset if I did that.
Tom and Mary said they wouldn't be there.
They said they thought I could win.
Tom means everyone, isn't he?
Tom's not really in Boston now.
I hope to get an email from you today.

Do what Tom tells you to do.
Saturday is the last day of the week.
I know that Tom would probably know how to do that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be grump.
I know Tom knows why we don't have that on Monday.
Who's your favorite singer?
I promise you I'll help you.
Tom said he knew Mary might not want to do that again.
Tom thinks he left his umbrella on the train.
I'm a lot taller than Tom.
I know that Tom can speak French.
I know Tom would be quicker at doing that rather than Mary.
My hand is better than Tom's.
Hello, what's your name?
They say they won't be here tomorrow.
Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston.
I assume this is because of the fact that Tom is a small one.
I always suspected that Tom was a little paranoid.
I know Tom knows I'm planning to do that.
You should have been able to do that much better.
We work every day but Monday.
I know you're not the ones who did it.
Tom said he didn't have power to stop it.
I know that Tom and Mary were married.
I should have been here yesterday.
It's not heavy.
That's why Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited that I was married.
Tom told me he'd probably cry.
I thought they'd find someone else.
I'm the only one there who knows that Tom doesn't want to do that.
I doubt that Tom did that on purpose.
I think you're probably busy now.
Tom said he thought we should do it by himself.
I don't think this is an exception.
I know you don't like me very much.
I thought it was necessary for us to do anything about that today.
Tom has a lot of things he wants to do today.
Tom said something that night later about that.
Tom admit he's not brave.
I know I should have done that.
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
I doubt Tom's waiting for us.
Dogs who are dead can't bite.
I don't think Tom's crazy as some people think.
I don't think I'll be able to do it by myself.
Tom doesn't think we'll find anyone who can do it for us.
She avoids his eyes.
Tom's not fat as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do it by myself.
Tom says Mary's still planning to do that.
I thought Tom had to be wrong.
Tom said Mary didn't care what he did.
They said they didn't like this.
Tom is the reason Mary moved to Boston.
I should have introduced myself.
Tom said Mary was looking forward to being reinstated.
I can't remember when he moved to Boston.
I've never fell in love with anyone.
This is the first time Tom ever complained about it.
Tom's like it's everyone.
I don't think anyone thinks you're crazy.
He didn't have a mobile.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said Mary thought John could not be allowed to do that by himself.
There's no need for Tom to do that.
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that.
I suspect Tom is involved.
How many kilos have you lost?
Both Tom and Mary are okay.
I'm a despicable man.
I'll never forget the time you and I go to Australia together.
Tom's not the only one who's planning to stay with us tonight.
Tom and Mary have both decided not to leave.
Tom told me he's sleepingy.
Mary tried on her mother's clothes.
Tom accepted that he stole Mary's wheel.
I'm pried off the lid.
Tom said Mary was likely in Australia.
Tom said he didn't want to do that here.
I'm three years older than you.
When's your birthday?
They said they were hurt.
It's clear that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
I would have helped you.
I don't know that Tom and Mary are married.
I didn't hurt anyone.
We can't play ball here.
Tom and Mary say they won't mind.
I'm not in the mood.
I thought you said you had fun.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary knew anybody in Boston.
I was on a diet for more than a year.
Tom said he wasn't willing to help us.
Tom thought Mary had a license.
I know Tom's a pretty good drummer.
Tom realized he wouldn't be able to change anything.
Tom said Mary should have done that alone.
I don't know you're still living with your parents.
Tom said he wanted to buy a weathervane.
You don't know that Tom is Canada?
Come on, guys, this isn't funny anymore.
I doubt Tom's at home, sleeping.
Tom and Mary told me they'd do it again.
Tom threw up.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Tom must have left the water running.
I'm a farmer.
It's not easy to get married to Tom.
I don't know there's a pool here.
Tom and Mary say they're not concerned.
Tom didn't stay in Boston for as long as he wanted.
Tom said he's a Canada.
I'd like to have another cup of coffee.
I guess Tom's still married to Mary.
Tom said everyone he knows he enjoys doing it.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here yesterday.
I know Tom could do that sometimes.
Do you let your kids play in the street?
I can't believe Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom suspected Mary could do that.
There's a cat under the table.
I think Tom's a bad man.
I don't think Tom knows when it happened.
Is Tom really moving to Boston?
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia anymore.
I thought you were tired.
Tom said I'm looking at you.
I think Tom can make Mary do that.
I'm interested in chess these days.
I don't think I'd like to live in Australia.
Tom said Mary should have done it by himself.
My parents died when I was three.
I think Tom was deceived.
What you're saying is totally wrong.
He's depressed.
I know I have to help Tom tomorrow.
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now.
Tom said Mary was khát.
They said they didn't enjoy it.
I'm peeling táos.
They said they'd never study French.
They said they thought I was creative.
Tom told me he's not sure what he should do.
Tom told me I should have said yes.
Tom did not press the button.
There's nothing left in the fridge.
Tom said he knew Mary might not need to do that.
I know Tom wouldn't have to do that.
Tom said he didn't know that Mary couldn't speak very well.
I don't think there's any chance I'll be there in time.
I think both Tom and Mary are going to be busy tomorrow.
Tom said he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said he didn't plan on going with us this weekend.
I don't think Tom's sure that's what Mary wants to do.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to buy what he needed for three hundred dollars.
Everybody loves free stuff.
I don't think this is funny.
If Tom does that, I will, too.
I know Tom's still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they were ready to help me.
Tom's not the one who told me Mary should.
I thought you said you'd still like to do that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary wanted to do that or not.
They say they're not planning on going.
Tom's a very nice boy.
Tom and Mary said they didn't really expect anyone to do that.
Tom said it was Mary who told him that he should.
Tom didn't think Mary was annoyed.
I don't think I can hold on longer.
Tom's not as tall as Mary.
Tom said he didn't think the heat bothered Mary.
I know you're a coward.
You're lying!
I told Tom I didn't.
I think Tom's talking to Mary now.
I promised Tom I would help him.
I believe everyone deserves a chance.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to be at the meeting.
Tom didn't know I had to do that today.
I don't think you really want to call attention.
Tom said he knew Mary was the one who did it.
I thought Tom and Mary were going to kill John.
Leave the light on, please.
Tom said Australia was a nice place to visit.
I thought Tom was in big trouble.
I listen to everyone.
It's not working.
Tom's speech lasted for three hours.
I wonder if Tom is alive.
I'm probably trying to borrow a vacuum from Tom.
Tom may be surprised.
I don't think anyone wants to see that movie more than once.
I can't remember anything else at this time.
Tom needs to know that someone cares.
I think Tom won't be in Australia very long.
Tom told Mary he'd never come back here.
I don't know you can't do that by yourself.
I doubt Tom will never agree to do that.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants to buy.
He can't stop me.
I think Tom's unresponsible.
I thought it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two.
I know Tom is more likely to do that today than he was yesterday.
I think Tom's doing something illegal.
Our streets are flooding when we have rains.
I'll probably be busy this afternoon.
I don't think you have a lot of choices.
Tom said he thought he could do that on October 20th.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was planning to do that.
I know Tom may be allowed to do that again.
Tom gave me the last piece of cake.
I know Tom is a very good drummer.
We know you're working for them.
Everybody here except Tom did it.
I think you should do it yourself.
I think everyone has a idea of what Tom is capable of.
Tom knows he could have done that better.
Tom said he wished Mary wouldn't do it by himself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was upset.
I wonder if it's safe to camp here.
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that.
I'm a university.
I think Tom didn't do that, but I could be wrong.
Which country are you from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I've made enough spaghetti for everyone.
I know Tom is the one who should have told Mary she needs to do that.
I don't think it's gonna be a good idea to do it by yourself.
Are you saying you don't want to do this?
I know Tom can't stop me from doing that.
I can assure you that won't happen.
Tom plan to sit in the back.
Tom said hed gave a book to Mary.
It would have been impossible.
I know Tom would probably know how to do that.
I know Tom's a kid.
Tom said he had no reason to stay.
Tom and Mary knew they were partly blamed.
I'm not surprised that Tom plan on doing that.
Hardly anyone expected Tom to win.
Don't interrupt my words!
I don't think Tom realized how hard that job would be.
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them.
Why don't you put on your dress if you're cold?
Tom knows he can trust me.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning on staying in Australia very long.
I heard you quit smoking.
Tom obviously doesn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom really likes doing so much.
Tom may be awake now.
It's not reasonable.
Tom told me he thought Mary was divorced.
Tom told me he was next.
Tom said Mary knew John might have had to do that by himself.
Tom said he was good at speaking French.
This isn't salt.
Did anyone see Tom?
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
My dog sleeps in the same room I do.
He didn't keep his word.
I know that's not true.
Tom says he's planning on doing it.
I suspect Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible.
I know Tom can speak French better than I can.
I suspect Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.

Tom's sleeping on the sofa room.
I found both Tom and Mary like romance novels.
Tom knows I didn't do that yesterday.
I suspect Tom and Mary are busy all day.
Tom told everyone he was ready to do that.
We'll go on a picnic if it's okay tomorrow.
Promise me you won't tell anyone.
It's Mary.
They say they're Bladed.
I think Tom will probably be able to do that.
Tom did that whenever he could.
They said their house wasn't for sale.
I'm not fat.
I thought I wouldn't be able to do that.
I think we have more important things we should do now.

It looks like Tom likes everyone.
I'm surprised Tom wasn't here yesterday.
Mary's got to deal with her new flat.
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week.
I don't think you need to tell Tom you plan to do that.
They swear they'd never do that.
Everyone's standing there, shock.
I'm looking forward to hearing why you think we should do that.
Tom told me he wasn't insulting.
I'm sorry I'm not as careful as I should have been.
Tom doesn't look too good.
Tom said he thought I should do it by myself.
I don't think Tom looks like his brother.
Tom said he heard noises in the kitchen.

They wish they could fly.
What a beauty!
I saw Mt. Fuji.
Tom didn't know that the bridge was closed.
They said they don't like to do that.
I thought Tom would have found Mary now.
Tom said he wouldn't mind if Mary did that.
You shouldn't just assume Tom was guilty.
Watch yourself.

Someone has to tell Tom what to do.
I don't know Tom did that when he was thirteen.
Tom said he didn't think you could win.
Tom and I are both vearians.
Tom said I'm the only one who thanked him.
Enough!
I wonder if Tom knows I need to do that.

I guess it's like that everywhere.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were children.
It's not until you lost your health that you recognize it.
That could have hit me.
They told me they're losing weight.
My house is not big.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do that.
You don't know I'm still planning on join the team, do you?
The bathroom is not very clean.
They said they were safe.

Except for Tom, everyone did it.
She's been sick for three weeks.
Tom said he wished he could speak French better.
I can't dance.
Tom didn't have a prayer.
Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
I know Tom knows I'm the one who has to do that.
Tom's not missing, is he?
I left my umbrella in the phone.
I did something bad.
I doubt Tom would be interested in doing that.
I promised Tom that I would.
I thought Tom would never show up.
That's too good to be true.
Tom said that would be fun.
Tom found it hard to be obedient.
Courgettes are green.
I should never have broken up with Mary.
I wish I was in Australia now.
Tom knows I'd be early.
Tom Tossed his dog some bread.
What does this have to do with us?
How do I know you're telling me the truth?
Tom didn't know I was supposed to do that.
That's just impossible.
I'm afraid we can't do anything.
I'm pretty sure I can do that.
Tom said he and Mary would spend Christmas together.
Why did you fail in the entrance?
Tom found it hard to stay without it.
Tom told me he had to leave.
Tom said he couldn't prove Mary did it.
Tom and Mary told everyone they're boring.
Tom says he's glad you're coming.
Tom thought Mary was really.
I know there'll be a lot of good food at the picnic.
Does anyone have any questions so far?
I doubt Tom's not going to do that.
Tom was never afraid of anyone.
They said they'd rather come next week.
What are you talking about?
Tom said he thought Mary was used by what was going on.
Everybody in the room did the same thing.
They're incomparable.
Tom doesn't know you're the one who wants to do that.
They promised they wouldn't.
I really thought Tom would do that.
You must have done that last year.
Can you take a picture of me?
We should have expected that to happen.
It would have been wise to do that.
Tom told me he didn't have a problem with that.
Tom said Mary shouldn't have gone home by herself.
Tom's got to be Sladed.
How long has your head been hurting?
Thank you, bud!
Tom said no one was fired.
Do you think we should have gone to where Tom wants us to go instead of coming here?
He's got earsache.
I don't think Tom wants to do it yourself.
I'm not sure I can trust Tom.

I thought Tom dumped Mary a month ago.
I think Tom won't be the last one to do that.
Tom would have done the same thing you did.
I don't think Tom's downstairs.
I need to know that we can rely on Tom.
Tom said Mary thought he might not be allowed to do that.
I realized that it wasn't very likely to happen.
They say drugs are not safe.
I know that it's not so much that anyone can help me.
I think Tom's gonna call you.
I don't know you're such a superstitious person.
Tom said he thought it would be a big mistake to tell Mary what happened.
Tom thought Mary would not cry.
This works enough to break my back.
That would never happen if you did what I told you to do.
I wonder if Tom wants to go to Boston with us.
I can't.
We need to replace the heater.
Does anyone have a kleenex?
Tom told us he thought he could be a famous singer.
We've done that already.
Tom is a hemophiliac.
I'm not gonna say anything.
Tom said he'd be happy to answer any questions we have.

Tom and I are both wrong.
I assume you still enjoy beer.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were able to do that.
What's your mother's name?
I don't think Tom is the one you should be talking to.
Sami knows what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom said I had to learn French.
You're not obligated to do that, are you?
You've got a big head.
He's very smart.
I would never have hired Tom.
Tom knows you've done that?
Tom eats more than I eat.
I don't know that Tom was in Boston last Monday.
Tom said he didn't think anyone could do that.

I want to see Boston again.
With teaching and learning my time is taken up.

It's not my business.
Mary has a big postcard collection.
I know Tom won't have enough money.
Tom says you're willing to help.
I assume you want to meet Tom.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary comes back from Boston.
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary good night last night.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I know Tom's not a bad student.
It's not Tom's gonna do that.
Is it hard to milk a goat?
Do you think we'll ever find our way back to the campite?
Tom doesn't know I have three cats.
I should have quit while I was ahead.
Is anyone alive here?
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
My grandmothers texts faster than you.
Do both Tom and Mary live in Boston?
Let's hit the slopes!
What's your favorite word?
Tom knows he made the right choice.
I thought you said you would do it for Tom.
I don't think anyone noticed what you did.
I wonder if I can help Tom.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was interesting.
You're not the only one here who can speak French, are you?
Get out of here.
I know this isn't hard.
I doubt Tom and Mary are not ready to do that yet.
I thought you might be hungry.
I think Tom told you I'd be here.
Did you know Tom was going to be in Australia every week?
Tom said he didn't know that Mary was finally leaving him.
You're not still afraid, are you?
I thought you'd cry.
The value of health cannot be overestimated.
You'll suffer because of that.
I don't think Tom knows exactly how much it's gonna cost.
Tom says he's healthy.
I know Tom's nice.
Tom knows Mary's planning on doing that.
Don't take off your gloves.
Keep it up!
Tom said he wasn't going to do that again.
Tom should have been able to show you how to do that.
Tom said he and Mary left early because Mary was sick.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unfriendly.
Put your pants on.
They said they weren't ready to talk.
I know Tom wasn't the one who was supposed to do that.
I admit I've despised Tom since the first time I met him.
Is there a lot of Africans in Germany?
Where did you put the TV guide?
Tom said Mary wasn't pretty.
It's true that the earth is round.
Tom can't help smile.

Tom told me he was forgiven.
Tom said he thought Mary would do that tomorrow.
Tom knows there's only one course of action.

They say they lost their keys.
I've decided not to do that again.
I don't know you're dating Tom.
I think Tom hasn't made a decision yet.
I know you still want to do that.
Please tell Tom and Mary that they're not required to do that.
Good job, guys!
I know Tom doesn't know that he's not supposed to be doing that today.
Tom and Mary say they don't want to do that.
Toms, he doesn't have to live in Australia for more than a year.
You don't know that everybody's talking about us?
Tom said Mary knew he didn't want to do that until next Monday.
I know Tom's house is for sale.
I don't think Tom's sad.
I don't think Tom would really win.
I'd have wanted to do it with you.
I'm not interested in sex.
Tom told everyone he was determined to do that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was serious.

We wish we could have done more to help.
Tom said he thought it would snow tonight.
I promised Tom I would be home early.
Tom said he'd look at it.
Tom said it's harder than he thought it would be.
You'd love the movie.
They told me they didn't really care what happened.
Tom's speech isn't as long as Mary's.
I don't know that Tom would be willing to show me how to do that.
I'm sorry I bothered you.
Everyone seems afraid but you.
Tom was afraid his parents would start asking him questions and that he would end up telling them everything.
Is the book you were reading yesterday in France?
I'm a doer damage.
Tom didn't know I was from Australia.
You could have gone.
Tom said he didn't think the smell was bothered Mary.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
I thought you were a better chess player than this.

I don't think we have much time.
Tom says he's trying to hide Mary.
I don't think Tom would have done it for me.
Tom is the funnest guy I've ever met.
I doubt Tom was planning to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary might not have had to do that week.
I know Tom knows he doesn't have to do that.
To tell the truth, I'm not your father.
I don't think Tom will be doing it with Mary.
That's the real reason Tom ran away from home, isn't it?
I thought you could ride Mary home.
Tom said he hopes that Mary tried to do that.
You like chocolate, right?
I don't think Tom really had to do that this morning.

I'm pretty certain that Tom doesn't have any relatives.
I think Tom is the one who wants to do that.
I doubt that's not going to happen.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are telling the truth.
Do all you think this is a good idea?
It must have been broken during the shipping.
They said they wouldn't win.
Tom said he thought Mary was a good cook.
They didn't admit they did it yet.
Everybody except Tom knows he didn't have to go to Boston.
I know Tom knows why Mary had to do that yesterday.

If I could have spoken French better, I might have got that job.
Are you feeling okay today?

Tom and Mary say they need to do that.
Let's hope that never happen again.
I don't think that really happened.
Tom said Mary was arrested before.
Tom said Mary wasn't ready.
I don't think Tom knows everyone's name.
Tom's got a problem to admitting he's wrong.
I thought you might want to play a game of chess.
Tom said he thought Mary would be impressed.
I know that it's not very different than anyone knows me.
Tom said he wasn't sure he could do it.
Are you going to be okay?
They told me they were famished.
I thought something was wrong with Tom.
Tom said he's not sleeping yet.
Tom thinks everyone knows Mary's going to do that.
I know Tom probably shouldn't do that anymore.
I don't know Tom can do that.
It looks like Tom's waiting for someone.
Tom said he thought Mary was probably having a good time in Boston.
You broke the computer.
I'm afraid you'll be lost.
They say they like learning French.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's favorite flower is.
I know Tom's ready to do that.
I doubt Tom would do that.
Tom said he was going to stay all night long.
I don't know Tom's a veteran.
I thought this was what you wanted me to buy.
My daughter often experienced asthma attack as a child.
I know Tom doesn't know you're the one who did it.
We've met everyone.
Tom said there's still a lot of things left to do.
You don't have a chance.
If Tom had enough money, he would have gone to Boston with Mary.
Tom told everyone he was happy that he was going to happen.
You're always doubting my word.
I don't know I can't do what Tom asked me to do.
There's a good chance we'll win.
Tom said he knew Mary could win.
I know Tom's not a fan.
I know Tom would ask Mary to do that.
I think Tom shouldn't agree to do that.
I don't think Tom sold anything all day.
I think I'm too old for her.
I don't think I should have left early.
I didn't say I was going to Australia.
Tom should have stayed in Boston for a few days.
I should have told Tom sooner.
Tom and Mary said they didn't like to do that.
Tom will remember.
It's not something I think I can do.
Tom told me where he was planning to stay.
I know you're not planning to stay in Australia.
I know Tom's imposite.
Do you have a pen I can borrow?
Tom also wanted to do that.
I could have done that for you.
I think Tom's home.
It's been used for America to lose our young men and women.
Tom should do everything they tell him.
Everybody but Tom knows he didn't have to go to Australia.
What's the most beautiful place in the world?
The storm causes much damage to the crop.
I don't think everybody's gone.
Let's get our photos.
I know it won't be easy.
No doubt all the lights are out.
Tom and Mary say they'll probably win.
I think Tom would be annoyed if you did it.
Tom and Mary think they'd find another job.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early.
I know I should stay and help.
Don't look at me.
I suspect Tom and Mary are planning on doing that tomorrow.
I don't know how to drive a bus.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
I know Tom did that well.
Tom said nothing changed.
That's not one of my priorities.
It's not something I can decide quickly.
I'm sorry I can't make it to your party last night.
I know Tom knows I need to do that.
Stay out of this.
I know Tom is afraid he'll be fired.
If I were you, I would call the doctor.
I'm not feeling very hungry.
I did everything you asked me to do.
Do you have a tie I can borrow?
I don't think we'll find anyone who can do that for us.
Tom's not a angel.
I think Tom's crazy.
That sounds amazing.
Tom is driving over to Mary's apartment to give her something.
Tom said he thought Mary would wait.
Tom said he didn't think the smell was bothered Mary.
Tom said he was willing to do it for us.
Can you believe Tom is still just thirteen?
Tom sent Mary.
Tom already knew Mary didn't plan to be here today.
They say they've never eaten Thai food.
I think Tom and Mary had never been both to Boston.
They're playing chess.
I thought I heard someone sing.
I heard Tom plan to move to Australia.
It's not like hot here as I expected.
They don't think they'll do that.
I don't think I belong here.
No one saw Tom leaving.
I know Tom used to live in Boston.
Tom ran home to get something he forgot.
Tom told me he could win.
Tom has no problem with Mary.
I thought Tom refused to do that.
How do you know that you're not misunderstood me for someone else?
You should have refused to stay in Boston.
No one can save you.
I'm glad I didn't do that.
I'm starting to believe we'll never convince Tom that he's wrong.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
Tom should never be left out of prison.
His train came at the main station at 550 p.m.
They said they couldn't wait.
Tom said Mary thought that John could be required to do it by himself.
I know what I'd do.
He doesn't needn't have brought the umbrella.
Both Tom and Mary were not at home when we went to visit them.
Tom thinks I need to do that today.
Tom admit he didn't do what we asked him to do.
It's a pity that we didn't visit Tom when we had a chance.
Tom told me you were with him last afternoon.
Tom and I don't know that we're the ones we're supposed to do.
I'm so tired that I can walk hard.
They feel they need to do something.
I read a lot of foreign languages, but I speak no.
You set up a trap.
I should have added salt.
I know that's not what you want.
I don't know Tom and Mary used to be married.
I think Tom was broken.
Tom and Mary say they'll never do that.
I think Tom's sorry.
You're skinny the first time I met you.
I think Tom could have been home by myself.
Both Tom and Mary know who you are.
Mary said she didn't plan to do it yourself.
It's not supposed to be fun.
They said they were unimpressed.
Tom hasn't told us what he needs to do.
I know you probably don't have to do that.
I wonder if Tom still remembers where we first met.
If you only helped me yesterday, the problem would have been avoided.
Tom said he expected Mary to return to Boston on October 20th.
Tom said he thought he might be required to do it again.
Tom thinks you want me to pay the bill.
Tom and Mary said they didn't swim.
I know Tom told Mary he couldn't do that.
Tom said he had to leave early.
They realize they're ignored.
If Tom left at 2:30, he would have been here now.
Tom and Mary said they would do it.
No doubt Tom used to live in Australia.
Tom decided to stay in Australia for three days.
Tom says he thinks I seem to be unconcerned.
I should have stayed and helped Tom.
Tom said he thought I could do that.
I thought Tom would be scared.
Tom thinks he's the best bơier here.
I wonder if it'll snow tomorrow.
I wonder if Tom's happy.
I'm frying fish.
The wind calmed down in the evening.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Slow down.
Tom would have done that by now if he was really planning to do it.
I know Tom can do that if he really needs to.
We'll never know.
Tom accepted that he killed Mary.
You don't know that taillights are not working?
They think they're in love.
Tom and Mary think they can do that.
Tom's never gonna hurt anyone again.
I've been learning that, uh, it's very fast.
You're not going to get into trouble for helping me, are you?
I heard that women spent more than men.
I think Tom's gonna be excited.
We'll be landing in 15 minutes.
Tom said he'd take care of Mary.
Tom's parents let him do whatever he wants to do.
I thought you were going to fix that.
I hope I'll never have to do that.
Tom was told he wouldn't be allowed to do that.
They say they're not.
I know Tom didn't know that he wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom should have told me earlier.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Both apologies to each other.
You're not doing anything wrong, are you?
Tom said Mary didn't think John would really do that.
They say they need to do that.
I know Tom knows why Mary had to do that.

I don't think Tom is as good-looking as John.

I don't think anyone's fighting that.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't remember.
Tom said he was hoping he could do that today.
You know everyone at the party, don't you?
Tom said Mary was unafraid.
I'm sorry it happened like this.
I know Tom's not afraid to walk through the woods alone.
Both Tom and I are angry.
I don't think Tom will be able to do that without some help.
It's hot.
Tom told me he didn't want to live in Boston.
No one asked me whether I like it or not.
Many old people these days can't keep up with the time.
Tom hoping he wouldn't be blamed for the problem.
I know Tom appreciates that.
Tom told me he decided to do that.
It's a cat.

Tom clear his throat loudly.
I think Tom's unprejudiced.
I'm afraid I lost it.
Tom said Mary was probably grumpy.
We're both adults.
They're not as weak as they used to be.

Don't talk about business while we're eating.
I don't think I need to help Tom do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was tough.
I hope Tom was adopted by a good family.
Tom said he thought you knew Mary.
She's got to be taken to the hospital.
I'd have helped you if you asked.
Okay.
Tom said he thought I was wearing a wig.
This isn't a khoan.
Tom should have done that a long time ago.
I think Tom slept all afternoon.
I wonder if Tom's upset.
Tom said he knew they might not let him do that at school.
Tom said he hopes Marys likes to do that.
Tom would have done that for Mary if he had more time.
I don't think you really need to do that.
Something's not right.
Are you crazy?
I thought Tom like riddles.
I know Tom's not going to Boston with you.
Tom said he wasn't sure Mary had to do that.
I don't think Tom would be able to talk to Mary to do that.
Is it true that Tom and Mary plan to stay in Boston until October?
I don't know you don't want to do that by yourself.
Tom said he thought it would be fun.
I think you'll find out that it's Tom's fault.
I thought it was rather ingenious.
Do you know if Tom and Mary are going to do that?
What makes you think Tom and Mary are those who did that?
Do you still plan on doing that with Tom?
Tom said he didn't feel safe.
My younger sister is a famous TV star.
I know what time you said you would be there, but I couldn't be there at that time.
I don't think they're complaining.

Let's assume that's going to happen.
Tom told everyone he didn't know what to do.
Tom needs someone he can trust.
I want to hear a story.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was honest.
It's quite likely that Tom's coming.
I doubt Tom's coming to Boston this year.

You should have made better use of your time.
They say they're not planning on going.
Tom said it looks like Mary was having a hard time doing that.
I'm learning old English.
I want the rest of the money you owe me.
Tom said Mary could have done that alone.
I hope more people will be here.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard to get along.

They're not sure they can do that again.
I thought Tom was doing it.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still staring at me.
I thought Tom heard us.

I hope no one comes.
What color is Tom wearing?

You seem to be unforgiving to do that.

I don't think you'll have much fun.

Maybe it would be better if I didn't do it.
I doubt Tom would have to do that.
You know I'm not good with secrets.
I'm not as busy now as I was this year last year.
I would have spoken to Tom instead of just ignoreing him.
I thought you wanted to meet my family.
I don't think Tom will be ignored.
Tom said he was going to do that every day after he quits.
There's not much I can do to help, I'm afraid.

Tom said he's sure Mary can swim.
What's her problem?
I think Tom's focused.
I'm not interested in this.

You could have told me you'd be late.
Tom's delirious.
Will's willing to be right is a sign of wisdom.

If Tom doesn't do that, I won't.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was funny.

I could have saved Tom's life.
There's a good chance that Tom will ask Mary to dance.
Tom told me he found an interesting book about Australia at the local library.
I don't think we can take care of ourselves.
You need a lift?

It's not all that ridiculous.
I wonder if we have to.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to do that today.
The fuse has blown.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do that.
Tom should have been interested.
I wonder if Tom really wants me to do that today.
It's not good to mock people in public.
We should have planned for this.
I don't think you need to tell Tom why you don't do that.
They said they never did that.
Tom and Mary say they're not going to do that.
I know Tom's connected.
Tom said he needed to spend a few weeks in Australia.
Let's get married.
Get the fuck out!

He left for Tokyo tomorrow.
I'm not as useful as I should have been.
Tom said Mary was living in Australia.
They told me they didn't like learning in the morning.
You tricked me!

You're free to go.
I know that Tom is trusted.
Tom thinks it's pretty good.

Make sure nobody enters.
I doubt that will ever change.

It's clear that Tom's going to do that with Mary.
I doubt Tom's drunk.
I met someone yesterday who knew we.
Tom told me he didn't have insurance.
I hope I can live here with you.
Those agenda items are taken up enbloc for discussion.
Tom said he felt good about that.
I doubt that Tom and Mary knew something interesting was about to happen.
You know I need to do that, don't you?
They must have found out who I was.
I don't think I'm through the test.

They say they're working hard.
I don't think Tom knows if Mary likes him or not.
I don't think I can move to Boston until the next year.

I'm decorating the class.

It's hard to do that, isn't it?
The present I got from Tom is the best.
I don't think I have enough money.
Tom wasn't given the chance you and I were given.
How did you know Tom was planning on doing that?
Will you give me a pen?
You can stay here as long as you keep quiet.
I had a feeling that I was here before.
Tom was rude to everyone.
Tom said Mary was probably alive.
What's the stupidest thing you've ever done?
Tom and Mary didn't tell anyone they won't win the lottery.
Is there any chance Tom would want to do that with us?

Tom started laughing and everyone else started laughing, too.
If anyone can do that, you can.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was creative.
Tom knows you're not ready.
How can you have a laptop and not a cell phone?
Tom said he thought he would be able to do that today.
I know that Tom and Mary never did that together.
This method has its pluses and minuses.
I know Tom used to be a minister.
Tom said Mary kissed him.
They told us they wouldn't.
I know something funny.
I met a friend I haven't seen for three years.
Sooner or later, I'll go around to do that.
Tom said he didn't think anyone could do that.
Do you know Tom knows Mary?
I should have given Tom my old trombone.
I thought Tom would tell you how to do that.
Tom said he shouldn't have done that by himself.
They say they'll laugh.
Tom said it was an accident.
Tom said he had no vices.
I thought Tom would be here now.
I don't think I've seen you before.
I wrote him a letter.
I know Tom's curious.
Tom said Mary needed to do that.
I doubt we can prove it.
Tom thought Mary would like the present he bought for her.
I don't think Tom wants to say anything.
I'm glad you didn't tell Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was there.
I doubt Tom's worried about it.
I don't think you'll ever be able to do that.
It's not fair.
Tom said he agreed to do that.
It seems you're not having a good time here.
