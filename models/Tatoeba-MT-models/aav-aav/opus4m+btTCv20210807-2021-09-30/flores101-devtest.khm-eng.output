In addition, the lack of this does not have serious consequences such as: disruption to growth, fatigue, nutrition, and eventually death can be lost.
The most convenient plant resources will be the source of protein that can be found in vegetable leaves and vegetables, but their families are tasted like we are hard to dissolve these foods, except to cook it.
On the other hand, food comes from an animal (egg swine) not only easily soluble, but they also provide a lot of proteins that contain essential amino acids.
