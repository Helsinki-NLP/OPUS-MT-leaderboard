However, this is a difficult problem to solve, and it will take years ago, and we see the situation of a useful flow breaker.
The metal needle floats on the surface of the water due to the pressure on the upper surface.
The pressure on the upper surface occurs because the water molecules on the surface of the water are greatly attracted to each other than the air molecules above them.

This causes you to skate. If skies turn right, skiers fold right, if skies turn left, skiers fold to the left.
To return to their previous energy level, they must avoid the extra energy they get from light.
They do this by emitting a small piece of light called "fon".
Scientists call this process “The transmission of radiation emissions that are driven” because atoms are driven by bright light that cause light transmission, and light is also a kind of radiation emissions.
The next image shows the imaging release of the photons. Of course, the photons are much smaller than the extremely small ones.
"Fin" is smaller than objects that form atoms!
