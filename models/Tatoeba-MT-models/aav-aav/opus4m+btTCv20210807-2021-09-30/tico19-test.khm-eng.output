The rapid increase in coronavirus infection events (COVID-19) in the European Union/Economy Zone and the UK from 1st January to 15th March 2020
The increased case of coronavirus (COVID-19) is showing similar trends in countries of the EU/EEA, and the UK has confirmed that while in different stages depending on each country, COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in all countries.
Based on Italian experience, hospital countries and care organizations should increase the preparation for the increase in COVID-19 patients who will need healthcare and especially high attention.
On 31 December 2019, the chronic pneumonia case, which the cause of the disease was unknown, was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported a new type of coronavirus that refers to 2 coronaviruses of severe respiratory tract syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named Coronavirus (COVID-19).
The evidence is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have this mild disease, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most of these patients have recovered.
In the event of 14 percent of COVID-19 develops to be a serious disease that requires hospital treatment, while 6 percent of the other have severe diseases that require most care.
The patient's mortality rate of rested in hospitals due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assess the trends of rising events as a flow of COVID-19 in each country of the EU/EEA and UK, and compare them to Hubei, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the European Union/Economy Zone and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January until 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in countries of the EU/EU economic zone and the UK.
After attacking China, COVID-19 continued to spread, the rapid COVID-19 pandemic around the world today is following the tips of China.
On 11 March 2020, World Health Organization General Directorate (WHO) announced that COVID-19 is a global pandemic.
In the 5 March journal of the Eurosurveillance, 2020, Stephen (Spiteri) and others reported the first confirmed COVID-19 cases by Europe based on the definition of the disease, the World Health Organization.
In Europe/Economic Area, three confirmed cases were first reported by France on 24 January 2020 on people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were found in 30 countries of the European Union/Economy Zone and the UK, between 31 December 2019 and will date include 39,768 cases, and 1,727 cases of death were reported, 17,750 cases of infection and 1,441 of death were from only Italy.
Accepting the total number of events and events that occur as a perpetrator of the number of COVID-19 cases.
At the European Center for Disease Protection and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases that have been reported in each country worldwide from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, National Health and Regional Authority, and the World Health Organization are updated daily at 8:00 AM.
These data are used in the assessment of COVID-19 in countries of the EU/EU economies as well as the UK and compare all of these data with Italian data.
As a representative of the active COVID-19 pandemic, we calculated the ongoing events of the COVID-19 case that were adapted by 14 days, considering the usual COVID-19 journey in the countries of the European Union/EEA (EU/EEA) and the UK during January 1, 2020.
We also presented the number of increased cases of each country notified on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 AM compared to Italy during 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends of COVID-19 in Europe/Economy Regions and the UK
The trend in COVID-19 cases that occur as a flow of about 14 days in EU/EEA countries and the UK is following the tips at the case in Hubei province (China) (Figure 1).
For the European Union/Economy Zone and the entire United Kingdom, the incident that occurred as a flow of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February, and then increased dramatically on 28 February 2020 (more documentation).
This is mostly driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but European/Economy Regions and the UK have shown similar trends of rising events as a flow of COVID-19 (additional materials).
Figure 2 shows the total overlapping number of COVID-19 in European countries/EU/EEA countries and the UK, compared with Italy within 31 January – 15 March 2020.
The report highlights that on 15 March, 8:00 AM, 15 other countries of the European Union/Economy Zone and the UK already reported a total number of cases compared to the number of cases in Italy that just last three weeks or less.
Our results have shown that the number of cases of COVID-19 has been reported to have increased rapidly in the countries of the European Union/Economy Regions and the United Kingdom.
Observed trends in the event occur as a perpetrator of COVID-19 show that the pandemic is evolving at similar speeds in all countries.
This is in contrast to countries that are in different stages, changing national public health responses, and definitions of different cases in different countries and protocols for choosing patients to be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the region where Italy has reported the situation in that area that 10% of COVID-19 patients require attention and that many sources of information have also reported that hospitals as well as heavy care in those areas have worked as much as their capacity.
Data on the acceptance of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or strong lease care unit is currently available at the European Union/Economy zone for only 6% and 1% in respectively (data has not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to add to the current tracking data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
Studies carried out in 2010–11 showed a huge variation in the possibility to provide attention care and medium-level care beds in Europe, which ranges from 29.2 in Germany 4.2 beds among 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 facilities for mid-level care and care beds for 100,000 people in 2010-11).
Synopsis related to the outage of healthcare capacity was provided in the sixth new rapid risk assessment of the ECDC’s COVID-19 with estimates to the countries of the EU/EEA and the UK that the case of receiving COVID-19 patients exceeds the ability to provide severe bed care; 90%.
Because many cases have been gathered in some areas in Europe, the European Economic Zone and the UK, and hospitals and maintenance units usually serve the limited regional population only, so information about the case and care beds should be offered on the single behalf of the land unit for the 2nd statistics (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries have shown that the global pandemic of COVID-19 is rapidly evolving in the countries of the EU/EEA and the UK.
The countries of hospitals and care organizations should therefore pay attention to the new scenario of transmission to the community of SARS-CoV-2, which can be flown and increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who need healthcare and especially high attention, such as a case that is happening in affected areas in Italy.
As indicated in the new rapid risk assessment of the ECDC, the appropriate and comprehensive approach is necessary to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2-, with a change from resisting to a reduced method, while a rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide you with enough time to find out how to accept and respond appropriately if not applicable before and in time.
The rapid risk assessment also puts in public health measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short opportunity during which countries are more likely to increase their management efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare organizations.
If this fails, the healthcare system of EU countries/ other European economic regions may face an increase in patients who need high attention in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe respiratory disease (SARS) by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a disaster for people.
The virus is similar to its unique virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS to occur on thousands of people in 2003. SARS-CoV-2 can be copied from bats and cause similar symptoms through a mechanism similar to SARS-CoV.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is more infectious and affecting older people than youth, and more infectious men than women.
In response to the number of emerging publications on the outbreak, this article is looking to provide timely and comprehensive reviews on progressive research topics quickly.
We will talk about the basics of pandemics, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, forecasting and prevention of disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope that this review study will help us find out and help get rid of the threatened disease.
Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 became an unprecedented and unforgettable thing to all Chinese people who were driven to stay in the house all for holidays and for weeks after the outbreak of the new virus.
The virus was similar to coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Thus it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the WHO (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and other associated diseases were named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak of the disease began in Wuhan, China, with rapid spread over the country's surface and to about 50 countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus caused 80,000 cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being discharged from hospitals and more than 3000 patients who died.
The World Health Organization warns that COVID-19 is “public enemy number 1” and is more potent than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) not until two months, more than 200 studies have been published on COVID-19, including studies of the virus, infections, and treatments since the first report on January 7, 2020, which sets the virus sequence separate from many diversified patients.
This review seeks to summarize the evolution of research in the new industry that is rapidly developing.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with another disease (SARS) caused by coronavirus (CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS that broke out in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned regarding prevention and forecasts of the disease as well as questions we need to answer urgently.
CoVs are often considered non-hazardous agent to humans, which mainly cause about 15% of the flu.
However, in this decade we experienced coronavirus (CoVs) that were easily replicated to two people, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the first outbreak in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and then spread to more countries with more saviours and mortality rates.
Thus, COVID-19 is currently the third coronavirus outbreak in human recorded history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a set of unknown pneumonia patients was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the order of coronavirus (CoV) was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death cases from Wuhan were reported.
Meanwhile, the pandemic has spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20th, the disease of healthcare providers was reported to confirm that the infection from person to person was possible.
On 23 January, Wuhan was closed without public transportation.
On 24 January, the first practical experimental study on the disease showed that all 41 infected patients were only 21 people directly connected to Wuhan’s sea accessories market, which are considered to be a place of infection from unknown animals.
On January 30, the World Health Organization announced the pandemic as a temporary condition of world health.
As of the report, the disease spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries in the world (Figure 2).2)
As the situation is rapidly evolving the final scope and the severity of the outbreak continues to keep the most attentive track.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-center study on 8866 patients, including 4021 COVID-19 patients, showed the spread of the following pandemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infections are all ages, but most occur at 30-65 years old.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected people are over 50 years old, very little under 20 years old, and only 14 of the infected patients are under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/100,000) more than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has expanded cluster fluctuations or most of the clusters in and around Hubei province.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the beginning of the disease to the diagnosis.
The average duration of the pathogenic disease is approximately 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average period from the beginning of the disease to the death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproduction number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the R0 adjustment is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased sharply before 23 January 2020 was due to a large delivery time before the Spring Festival in China.
The patient's mortality rate with confirmed cases is 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the patient's facilitated mortality rate is 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 are sex (male), age (60), and people with severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses or CoVs are large and ambient viruses that contain a single RNA.
They can be divided into four genes (genera), i.e., the alpha beta gamma, and the beta-CoVs are known to be infected to humans.
Cycloidal spike (S), which is associated with 2 enzymatic cell stimulation, which transforms angiotensin (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then the membrane mix also occurs.
The virus’s RNA chain is transmitted into cytoplasm. After the gene dispersing of the RNA virus, which is enclosed by glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, form a small pond that is soluble with plasma membrane to release the virus continuously.
The first genetic order of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been found to be a new type of coronavirus (beta-CoV) with more than 99.98% genetic identity among the 10 order samples collected from the original place of the outbreak, the Hunan sea accessories market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through a microscope, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 particles was found in the thinest part of the human respiratory ethanol.
Human ACE2 is found to be a stimulation of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 associated with human ACE2 was weaker than the connection to SARS-CoV, which randomly associated with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 caused a little more infection to patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new type of short protein, coded by orf3b and secret protein coded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 can act in the pathogenicity of the virus and prevent the release of the IFN R. However, orf8 does not have a known function or sample domain.
On February 18, 2020, Chu and others reported the cryoEM structure of ACE2 with a complete size of people at 2.9 A with a block (complex) with B0AT1 of amino acid transmitter.
They found that it was complex with open and closed molecules, and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could connect two S proteins, all given as proof of recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 can become a clinical goal for medicinal control to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Main and middle copy
It is known that both SARS-CoV is native to bats and is copied to humans through civet cats and MERS-CoVs native to came from camels.
Through the comparison of SARS-CoV-2’s Phlogenetic with other coronavirus (CoVs), bats are considered the original replication of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% the same as the coronavirus (CoVs), like two SARS out of bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, what the central parent has helped the virus to get infected from species of animals to humans is still unclear, and its transmission route has not yet been known.
Ji (Ji) and others mentioned that snakes are the virus replicators from bats to people involved in recombination that are identical in S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have shown that poultry, a long-drink animal, cysts, cysts, often used in ancient Chinese medicine, is a central type of potential SARS-CoV-2 replication based on 99% genetic characteristics, is the same in coronavirus, which is found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference that spread to two genomes still is a huge difference. Therefore, the conclusion results are overall for actual evidence to be waited (Figure 33).
Chemical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet well known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can live within 48 hours in a dry environment, and it lives for 5 days under 20°C and 40%-50% moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 can be similar.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is not resistant to ultraviolet and heating at a temperature of 56°C for 30 minutes. Ethylene (ether), 75% of chlorine antibiotics containing aperacetic acid, chlorine and other fat solvents that are non-chlorhexidine, can inactivate the virus.
People often lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2, thus susceptible to this new virus.
Currently, no detailed research has been reported to the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
So we only looked at previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig 4).
Generally, after the virus penetration to the main copy, it is first recognized by the main immunity system through the sample recognition stimulation (PRRs) including the C-type lectin-like receptors, the Toll-like receptor stimulation (TLR), the receptor-like-NOD (NLR), and the RIG-I-like receptor stimulation (RLR).
The virus has caused the release of the agent that causes large inflammation of the coronavirus cells and the first type of inflammatory synthesis (IFNs), which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the virus's antibodies.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape from the immune system.
Soon, adapted immune system responses will be involved in the antivirus.
Blood lymphocytes T cells include CD4+ cells and CD8+T, which play an important role in body protection.
CD4+T cells to stimulate B cells to form a special antibodies against a specific virus and CDC8+T cells kill the virus directly.
T-Assisted cells produce anti-cytokines proinflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, coronaviruses can prevent T-cell function by pushing the form of death of T-cells.
Human fluid immunity systems plus C3a combinations and C5a and antibodies are also vital to the infection of the virus.
For example, the antibodies that were separated from the recovered patients made MERS-CoV normal.
On the other hand, excessive reactions of the immune system form a local number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organics and in the worst scenarios, multi-organization failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections, which are shown by the beginning of group symptoms, are likely to affect older people with pregnant diseases and women.
It’s common for people who face a large number of viruses or those with weak immune function, they have a higher chance of getting infected than others.
The average viral period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1-14 days, which mostly lasts 3-7 days based on a study of 425 first cases in Wuhan.
However, studies on 1099 cases have shown that the period of disease cirrhosis is 3 days on average and ranges from 0 to 24 days.
A further new study as described above shows that the period of awakening out of the disease is 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a population of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for the health authorities to adjust the time of effective quarantine based on the most accurate disease wake-up period, so it protects those infected but has no symptoms from transmission of the virus to others.
As usual, individuals who are exposed to or infected by the virus are usually required to make quarantine for 14 days.
Should I do glucose factor for up to 24 days?
Heated fever is the first and main symptom of COVID-19, which sometimes does not contain symptoms or have some other symptoms such as short-sleep dry coughs, muscle pain, headaches, headaches, misconducts, misconducts, misconducts, misconducts, misconducts, misconducts, misconducts, misconducts, misconducts, misconducts, misconducts, misconducts, misconducts, misconducts, misconducts, misconducts, misconducts, misconducts, and misconducts.
Some patients experience acute problem and/or lack of blood oxygen per week after the start of the disease.
In severe cases, patients have begun to develop symptoms of acute respiratory respiratory reaction to too strong disease, evaporating over-melting acids and blood disintegration.
Patients with fever and/or symptoms of respiratory and fever, although there are no abnormalities of pneumonia, should also be checked for first diagnosis.
Population studies in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for 76% of fever for 55% of slurry cough for hepatitis and 3% for pandemic, and 8% of patients need air supply.
Similar research has shown that two recent studies of a family cluster and a group of people caused by infections from individuals without symptoms.
Compared to demographic studies in 2012, MERS-CoV patients have 98% of their own warm cough dry 47% difficulty breathing 55%, their main symptoms.
However, 80% of these patients need more ventilation help than COVID-19 patients, and it is similar to MERS who are more severe than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and coronavirus (21%) are also observed in patients (MERS).
For SARS patients, it is shown that heated fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), fatigue (40%-42%), diabetes (20-25%), and cyst pain (13-25%) are major symptoms, and ventilation support is required for patients about 14%-20%.
As of February 14th, the death of COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases were 66576 cases worldwide
Compared to the mortality rate of SARS as of November 2002, 10% of the confirmed cases were 8.096 cases.
For MERS, based on demographic studies in June 2012, the mortality rate is 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 has a high dosage of up to 6,47 with 95% (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV is between 2 and 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV involving symptoms, memory rates, and R0 are shown in the Table 1.1.
The above figures have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is more capable than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in the spread, but it is less dangerous than the next two viruses.
Therefore, it is difficult to manage the spread of SARS-CoV-2 stronger than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The beginning of the disease is a story that arises from a single family or occurs from any collection or a single ride of vehicles such as a tourist boat, etc.
Patients generally have a history of travel or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas, or are also in contact with infected individuals or patients in the last two weeks before starting a disease.
However, it has been reported that people can load the virus without showing any symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients who have been treated heal and out of the hospital, and can again load the virus, which shows a temporary post to increase the time for a quarantine.
Patients may have a normal number or a reduction in the blood cells (lymphoctyes) at the initial stage.
For example, phosphorus found with the number of blood cells, 4×109/L, including the number of phosphorus, 1×109/L, and the presence of blood viruses, and anabolic levels of nanoparticles, which increased in 1,099 COVID-19 patients themselves.
The enzyme levels of muscle liver and myoglobin have increased in the blood of some patients, and the protein with C-reactive and electrocyte sedimentation has also increased in the blood of some large patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer levels (D-dimer), a weak product of fibrin, which is in the blood is increased, and the number of lymphocyte is reduced in order.
Unusuality at chest radiation is found in most COVID-19 patients, and is characterized by dual parasites or pneumatic glass on the lungs.
Patients often develop into a normal pneumonia, acute pneumonia injury, and acute respiratory respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When severe respiratory symptoms, unmanageable inflammation, fluid receptor and evolution into a lung fragrance can make it impossible to change gasoline or air within it.
The infertility of type I and type II of pneumocytes causes a decrease in the levels of surfactant and increases the stress of the outer surface, thus reducing the indispensable lung capacity and increasing the risk of lung damage.
Therefore, the findings of rays in the worst chest section are often consistent with the most severe levels of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the outbreak of pneumocytes, the occurrence of the membrane and interstitial interstitial interstitial membrane cell penetration and multivitaminal respiratory cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, in accordance with the infection of disease and ARDS, and similar to the infection of SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through reverse polymerase chain reaction (trans-transcriptase polymerase (RT-PCR)) is used as an important criteria for diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to high false positive rates that can accelerate the spread, clinical presentations were started to use for diagnosis (which are no longer dependent on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
The same situation also occurred with SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, combining the history of the disease, the results show practical experiments, test results from the X-ray laboratory are important and useful for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Chang group described the protocol of using CRISPR-based techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2, which explores SARS-CoV-2 RNA-synthesis pieces at 20×10-18 mol/L to 200×10-18 mol/L (10-100 rules per microscope of input), using a needle for chemical liquid measuring in less than one hour without using a very important device.
Hope that this new technique helps to advance the understanding of the key points and give convenience if verified in the actual experimental samples.
Due to the lack of experience in CoV treatment, the team of doctors only provided a secondary care treatment to COVID-19 patients while trying to test various treatments that were previously used or previously recommended for other coronavirus treatments such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other viruses. (Table 2).
These treatments include current treatments and potential treatments using antiviral antiviral drugs that weaken the immune system of steroids, plasma from patients who have recovered Chinese medicines and mental assistance.
Even plasma from recovered patients is also asked to use for treatment.
Many pharmaceutical companies are competing to create antibodies and antiviral vaccine.
SARS-CoV-2 virus begins to attack lung organisms in the early stages and continues to hit lightly to other organics that release ACE2, such as digestion and kidneys, etc.
However, irrational failure and respiratory failure is a major threat to patients, and it is also the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support is important to reduce symptoms and save lives and include general oxygen treatment, high flow oxygen, non-respiratory ventilation and mechanical air that evaporates by it depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory syndrome must be treated with extracoreal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a technique in maintaining a heart and lung articulation system that is used in treating heart crash cases, and a respiratory impairment that threatens life.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balancing, protection and treatment of subordinate infections and ultra-thin reactions to the virus and the protection of the function of these important organisms is also necessary for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that the typhoon caused by a strong immune response to SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine Storm (Cytokine) is a form of systematic inflammation response, presented by the subsequent fibroid release, including TNFα, IL-1R, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNR, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cysts push the cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and the failure of many organisms.
The immunization is necessary to treat cytokine storms, especially for severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumabs, an anti-Molecular IL6 antibody, are used to treat cyclone storms.
Other immunotherapy treatments for cytokine cytokine (cytokine) include coordination of T cell immune responses, corrosion of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF JAK corrosion using ammonia (blinatumomab), cracking of 4 tokens, and HDAC corrosion.
Steroids, an immunotherapy drug, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS, to reduce the deterioration of severe inflammation.
However, steroids in high levels of consumption have no benefits in treating the severe pneumonia of SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, they can cause severe side effects, especially inflammation, affecting disease forecasts.
However, a short period of corticosteroids in low to medium dosages are recommended to be used carefully for severe COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no antiviral therapy was confirmed.
However, the intramuscular intramuscular intramuscular injection of Remdesivir, an effective Anatomy COVID-19 for American patients.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by the first Gilead biobiotics company for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated the possibility of preventing the combined RNA virus, including MERS and SARS.
Based on all this, Gilead has given compounds to China to carry out two experiments on people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are recommended as a potential treatment for patients with acute respiratory syndrome.
Grinding syphilis, degradation of liver cells and other activities can occur after the treatment plus the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully inspected.
Plasma from the recovered patients and the formation of the antibodies
Blood collection from patients who have recovered from the infection to treat other patients who suffer from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the infection is long history.
Of course, patients who have been healed have a high level of antibodies against the pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (ig) produced by lymphocytes B cells in combating the pathogens, as well as non-communist substances in the body, and they can have the ability to distinguish pathogenic molecules, and they go to kill that molecules directly.
Based on this point, plasma collected from the patient's blood recovered from COVID-19 will be injected into 10 serious patients.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours of accompanied by a decrease in inflammation and virus load and improve oxygen in the blood.
However, the verification and confirmation are necessary to request the method for large-scale use before any specific treatment is not yet established.
In addition, due to the effect of treating some disadvantages related to the shoulder should be considered carefully.
For example, the antibodies may exceed the immune response level and cause symptoms of cytokine release that can cause toxic to die.
The dosage of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and a lot of plasma is needed for the treatment of severe patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight the spread of the disease around the world.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from patients who have recovered and identified genetics that have included the antibodies or also to check for effective antibodies against the main protein of the virus.
Do this, we can quickly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in treating various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects largely depend on the combination of many compounds in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theory.
Most of the effective compounds are still unknown or uncertain because it is difficult to download and verify such components or combine it as best.
Currently due to the lack of effective and accurate treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild or medium symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, sulfuajidu capsules and hinges have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
It is observed that the highest rate of treatment for COVID-19 patients in some provinces in China, using TCM in 87% of patients from Gangsu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei, who used TCM in approximately 30% of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest rate of healing (13%).
However, this is a rush comparison because many other impact factors such as the number and severity of the patient should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Bollywood and colleagues printed research to compare Western treatments (WM) alone with joint treatment between WM and TCM.
They found that the time required for the original status of the body temperature, the diarrhea of symptoms and hospital stay for the WM+TCM group was shorter than the WM group.
The most interesting thing, the rate of symptoms worse (from light to heavy) is notable for the WM+TCM group that is lower than the WM (7.4% vs 46.2%), and the lower mortality rate for the WM+TCM group is lower than the WM (8.8% vs 39%).
However, TCM’s efficiency and safety still awaits well-controlled testing treatments in a large scale and in more centers.
It is also interesting to determine the mechanism of action and confirm the effective components of TCM treatment or its combined treatment if possible.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed that COVID-19 are mostly very afraid of this infection and may be more dangerous to life, and people who are put apart are also insomnia and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infections such as fever, inhalation and cough, as well as negative effects of treatments such as unsleep sleep caused by almost hundreds of corticosteroids, can cause more anxiety and mental difficulties.
The first phase of the outbreak of SARS, some complex mental problems, such as depression, anxiety, panic, hypertension, hypertension, obstruction, and suicide were reported to occur.
Monitoring of exposure and metabolic factors is essential, as part of public health responses to the outbreak of COVID-19, which can cause some people to be concerned and wrong about the effects of infectious, fiberglass and breastfeeding labels for their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients who suspect that there are diseases and people associated with them as well as the general public who are in need of this care.
Mental support should include the formation of a multi-professional mental health team, clear communication with regular and accurate updates about the treatment plan and the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close or too close relationships.
Effective vaccines are essential to preventing replication chains from animals and people infected with replicated viruses, and these vaccines are usually for addition to antiviral treatments to control the outbreak of new viruses that occur inflation.
The effort was made to develop vaccine out of S proteins for the formation of strong and long-term human immune systems against SARS-CoV.
Live vaccine is evaluated in animal samples for SARS.
However, the effectiveness of these live vaccine injected trials to older adults and specimens facing danger and their protection against genetic infections (infected from animals to humans) must be determined before actual experimental studies are started.
This is probably because SARS had evacuated 17 years ago, and no new case was reported.
On the other hand, a case spread at an auspice and a cluster of MERS disease continues to occur in the Middle East and spread to other areas due to the dry infectiousness of genetic sources (infected from animals to humans) in infected areas.
The vaccine production strategy was developed for MERS disease using non-viral DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, insects like viruses and recombined protein fragments, and some strategies were tested and evaluated samples on animals.
Efficiency and safety vaccine development against this SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and important task for preventing the pandemic.
However, it is still a barrier to overcome this difficult situation due to long term (usually 18 months), necessary in the development of vaccines and various rapid variations of CoVs.
Since it is a new type of COVID-19 disease, it has just begun to appear fully in testing treatment, when patients are already thousands of people.
In most cases, patients can be recovered gradually without any problems.
Although, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with disease rates and high mortality rates for patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the formation of predictive samples for the disease is necessary for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas where no resources are needed.
Based on practical experimental studies reported in the past, some of the following factors may be exposed or also associated with COVID-19 patients forecasts (table (Table 33):
Age: Ages are the most important factor for predicting the possibility of SARS and COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurs mostly to people aged 30-65, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age in the study of 8,866 cases as mentioned above.
Patients who need high attention are likely to be more complex and complex, and older than those who do not have (average 66 years vs 51), which shows that age is an analytical factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs 0.27/100,000) as mentioned above.
Disorder and complexity: COVID-19 patients who need strong care are likely to suffer from heart crashes and severe heart rates.
Heart problems are still the main reason for the death of SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may be inhibiting the ACE2-positive cholangioctues that cause the infertility of the liver of COVID-19 patients.
It is also worth noting that existing age and disease are really strongly interconnected, which can cause side effects between each other.
Laboratory abnormal findings: C (CRP) reaction protein levels in blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injuries and are submitted as predicted factors that may occur in the disease, response to the last treatment and healing.
The correlation of CRP levels to severity and forecasts of COVID-19 are also raised.
In addition, the increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict results.
These enzymes are widely shown in many organics, especially the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
So they are a regular sign for the inprocessingness of the heart or liver.
Symptoms from therapeutic treatment of practical experiments: the recording of chest rays and the progression of symptoms from clinical treatment should be considered together with other problems for predicting the outcomes and consequences of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: as mentioned above, steroids are substances that lower the immune system used to treat certain inflammatory diseases to reduce the severity of inflammation.
The use of high-level corticosteroids is used in treating serious SARS patients. Survivors have suffered acute sclerosis and bone that causes life defects or decreases the quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low and short time for COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As mentioned above during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffer abnormal stress because they endure long-term and whilst uncertainty and see the deaths of close family members and other patients.
It is necessary to provide mental counseling and long-term support to help these patients get rid of stress and return to normal life.
According to a recent demographic study, COVID-19 seems to be different from SARS pandemics.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tubes, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or non-psychological symptoms at the early stage of the infection, which is similar to other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stages or in unemployed periods of symptoms can produce a lot of viral amount during daily living activity that causes difficulty in controlling the pandemic.
However, the transmission or replication of SARS-CoV was considered to have occurred when patients had a serious illness while most infections did not occur at the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of disease (SARS).
Currently, the big effort is running in China, including the closing of Wuhan and the surrounding city, and the continuous quarantine of almost all people, hoping to hinder the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these activities have damaged the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a decrease in the spread.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March, and the decreased phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not as optimistic as this.
Heroes and others estimated that COVID-19, which seemed to be more infectious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others have developed a model to predict the outcome of the spread, and recommended that SARS-CoV-2 virus can reach two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was found both in mixed rubbers and throat resin of patients who recovered and out of hospital last two weeks, indicating that the new virus, known to be able to become a similar cycle stage of flu.
However, prominent signs have occurred in China based on the number of new cases that are declining, which it shows that the current strategy may be running.
Ebola was initially predicted that could cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through fiberglass and quarantination, the disease is placed under control.
It is possible because it is similar to SARS-CoV, where SARS-CoV-2 can be weakened in the infection and eventually diluted or become a pathogenic virus that is less common to humans.
The comparison between the global outbreak of COVID-19 with SARS and MERS is shown in the table below (table (table 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a high rate of infection through the middle cough or can also be transmitted through any contact containing the virus directly.
The virus is also found in serum, which increases the new possibility of infectious infections to the mouth.
A new study on 138 cases reported that 41% of total cases were probably caused by the spread of hospitals with 17 patients with existing patients including 40 health services providers.
Therefore, the best precautions should be taken to protect people, especially health providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, as well as those who face the patient or those who are infected.
The first protective wire available to reduce the risk of infection is through mass wear. Both use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series #1860s) helps manage the spread of the virus.
The face mask for surgery prevents liquid droplets from individuals that can be susceptible to infected by preventing air travel of the droplet or falling on the surface of other materials where they can be forwarded to others.
However, only N95 (series #1860s) masks can be protected against the penetration of viruses that are small from 10 to 80 nm, and 5% of the virus can be penetrated into this mass. SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV, where they are 85 nm.
Because particles can be penetrated even through five surgical masks that overlap the healthcare providers directly related with patients must wear N95 masss (series during 1860), but do not wear surgical masks.
In addition to wearing masks, health providers should wear separate medical suite in order to reduce direct exposure to more viruses.
The virus can also be copied to a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor passed SARS-CoV-2 virus, although he wears N95 masks. The virus may enter his body through his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers also need to wear face masks or glasses that protect their eyes when dealing with patients.
For the general population who are in the area of infection or infectiously, everyone is advised to wash hands with the soap more often than every time and try to stay in the home for self-gasing and identify communication with individuals that may be infected.
Threefts are considered a suitable distance for people to stay away from patients.
These activities are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 became a new virus for the human world, its extremely similar to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should make China highly careful and should have clearly remembered the outbreak of SARS in 2003.
However, until 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Management was consoled by saying that the new virus had low replications and its reproductive is still limited from one person to another, and it has no problem protecting and resisting the disease.
The message relaxed the emergency announcement to the public, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and it was an important time that had missed the prevention of the disease when it was still a little in Wuhan.
The disease management agencies in China may take this difficult lesson and do significantly improve the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful when making public declarations, because all words are important to citizens, and it can change their behavior and decisions. (2) Be careful and respond well to uncomplicated information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials. (3) More restrictions to withstand possible pandemics at the first stage rather than trying to comfort others’ public communities. And (4) more often in the exercise of targeted and effective testing to increase public awareness of pandemics and to improve and improve social response systems.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
Within less than two months, it has spread thousands throughout China and nearly 50 other countries worldwide at the time of writing.
Because the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 makes sense of SARS’ death again.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary for preventing spread and to treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than youth and more men than women and severity and mortality rates for older patients are also higher than youth.
SARS is more likely than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients replicate the virus to others, although they do not have symptoms, while SARS patients have no symptoms as they have a serious condition, which makes it harder to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spread faster than SARS-CoV.
The normal RNA thread of SARS-CoV-2 may not be present in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have been cured and may have a positive virus again.
These findings greatly increase the risk of viral spread.
With such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, there are some key issues to address the following:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the gene homogenizers have been found between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS from bats, we are still unable to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
What are the animals in the middle that can replicate the virus from the original host, such as bats to humans?
Without knowing the 1st and 2nd answer, we cannot effectively reduce the transmission or transmission, and the outbreak can be repeated at any time.
Despite molecular samples and biochemical testing, it has shown that SRAS-CoV-2 virus is flexible and repellent into ACE2, but how can the virus become into respiratory cells that cause the disease is unclear?
Can the virus connect cells that release ACE2 into other organics?
If there is no clear answer to these questions, we cannot get a quick, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus evolve during the infection among humans?
Will it become a global pandemic or disappear like SARS or reproductive as to large flu?
It is really important, but it may take some time to do research to respond to the above questions as well as other questions.
However, no matter what we have to spend, we have no choice, we have to stop spreading as soon as possible and make our lives return to normality.
Less genome (copy from animal to human) of human coronavirus
Its changes and amendments have driven coronaviruses (CoVs) and lifelihoods, including humanity for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two people with CoVs (HCoVs) caused mild diseases such as common colds.
The outbreak of severe respiratory symptoms (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has diverted the goal to show how much HCoV infection is, it is, shady and dangerous to human life.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China late in 2019 made the virus in hot spots again and surprised us of its intense spread, but as a decrease in the possibility of pathogenic diseases compared to its SARS-CoV sisters.
HCoV infection is a genetic disease (infected from animals to humans), and exploring the swisting source of HCoVs is possible to help us.
Most HCoVs are native to bats where they are not infected.
It has been found a central reservoir of some HCoVs.
The animal host identification has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Investigation of CoV-host interactions in the animal itself may be able to provide an additional understanding of coV infections in humans.
In this recall, we will demonstrate existing knowledge of the seven HCoVs and we will focus on the history of detection as well as the origin of animal-to-human transmission and transmission from one seed to another.
More importantly, we compare the differences between HCoVs and the perspective of the virus’s evolution as well as the collection of its genes.
The pandemic of CoV 2019 today (COVID-19) has been discussed in this context.
Furthermore, it also emphasizes the need for successful host changes and the impact of the virus’s evolution on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are located in the Coronaviridae group with a positive and single-wire RNA group.
These viruses are resilience to the largest genome from 26 to 32 are Lobbes among the RNA of the virus called "CoVs" because of the physique, it looks like a crown, if viewed in microscopics, using electronics.
By the structure, CoVs have non-particles that are similarly rich.
Approximately two-thirds of genomes have two large-floor open nanomet forms (ORF1a and ORF1b), which have been transferred into polypropylene proteins, pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyethylene is further processed to create 16 non-structured proteins, which are defined by nsp1~16.
The remaining parts of the gene contain ORFs for structured proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), mm (membrane (M)), and chloride protein (nucleoprotein (N)).
The proteomics of some threads are also coded by different CoVs threads.
According to a variety of protein sequences, COVs have been sent out into four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV) among these types, beta-CoVs are most HCoVs, and it is divided into four other bonuses (A, B, C, and D).
Proof that man-made botanicals have shown that bats and cocaine serve as the genome source of alpha-CoVs and most beta-CoVs, while birds are the main home of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have passed several species of animal braking, and some have emerged as a major human pathogenic agent.
To date, seven CoVs (HCoVs) holders have found.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
Five other types of Beta-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe respiratory syndrome, severe respiratory system syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome containing viruses (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 often causes mild symptoms such as normal flu and/or unhealthy.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which are newly discovered, are highly pathogens that cause lower respiratory infections of severe respiratory tracts to patients with a high percentage of progression into severe respiratory disease (ARDS) and lung external absorption.
The first B814 HCoV-229E varieties were separated from the diarrhea of patients with common colds in the mid-1960s.
Since then, it has been collected a lot of knowledge through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause symptoms with a limited period of time.
Of course, this concept is generally accepted that HCoVs infections are generally harmless until the outbreak of SARS.
The outbreak of SARS that occurred in 2003 was a huge destruction in the current history that infected more than 8000 people and had a total mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory outbreak caused a non-stop spread in the Arab Peninsula with a wide range of spreads to the world.
HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), rebranded by SARS-CoV-2, was an agent of the spread of 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19), who killed more than 3120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is alarming and the world is prepared for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs have fewer genetic origins from bats, rats or domestic pets.
Many evidence supports the origin of all the evolution of HCoVs, all the bats that the virus is sensitive and non-infectious, but shows the diversity of great genetics.
The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated a strong challenge in medical, social, and ethics to China and the world.
Monitoring of the zoonotic source of HCoVs provides a framework to explore the natural history, drive force, and the limitations of one-to-one cross-type factors.
This can also help guide or facilitate the search for the animal hosting, the main storage center, the storage pool of SARS-CoV-2, with important effects in preventing future outbreaks.
In this review, we show an overview of the origins of transmission from animals to humans, transmission from one type to one type and HCoVs.
In particular, we have noted and discussed a topic that says that the origin of HCoVs cannot be caused as a disease when it lives in its original host, but it turns out to cause the disease after it has been replicated to a new host.
We also review the trends of HCoV evolution, where the increase of transmission can occur often with a decrease in pathogens.
The ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also discussed in this context.
CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the initial separation of HCoV-229E, B814 from your mixed water flow with different common cold CoVs is isolated in infected animals, including Turkish, mouse, pig, cat, and dogs.
Over the past seven decades, HCoV has been identified.
Briefing the history of HCoV detection in order (Table 1) will provide information and guidance.
The first HCoV-229E strain was separated from the respiratory pathway of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was then adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell cables.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have common influenza symptoms, including migraine headaches and throat pain with fever and coughs, which have been experienced in 10~20% cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from organic feed and subsequently replicated in the modern mouse brain.
Clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection seem similar to symptoms caused by HCoV-229E, which are marked as non-disparent symptoms from infections with other respiratory infection agents, such as a large flu, a virus and a retail virus (rhinoviruses).
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed all over the world, and they tend to be generally delivered in the winter in the medium hot weather.
Generally, the wake-up period of both viruses is less than one week, then there is approximately 2 weeks.
According to a volunteer study by people who are healthy and infected with HCoV-229E developed into mild common colds.
Only patients with weak body protection systems show acute respiratory tract infection below the severe respiratory pathway.
SARS, known as "normal pneumonia", was recorded as the first known pandemic of HCoV in human history and the pathological agent, SARS-CoV, the third HCoV found.
The first case of SARS may occur since late 2002 in Guangdong, China.
The results of SARS pandemic have been reported to be 8096 deaths of 774 people, with pandemics to many countries and continents.
In addition to intense spreads, it is estimated that each case can cause a nominal case of about two by the wake of 4 to 7 days, and the virus's highest level appears on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV first have acute muscle pain, fever, fatigue, and cold headaches, and then acute cough and respiratory difficulty, a later symptoms.
Laphopine, a weak test of liver roles and a rise in Creatine kinase, is a mistake in the general laboratory of SARS.
SARS patients have seen several pneumonia pediatric degradation, a rapid increase in ethanol cells, and a white blood gain.
Approximately 20-30% of patients continuously need attention care and ventilation by engines.
In addition to various suborganismal respiratory infections, the stomach, liver, and kidneys can also be infected in some severe cases, often accompanied by increased cystitis, which can be harmful to life to patients with a weak immune system.
The virus was first dispersed from cutting as a spicy letter of relatives of patients who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, he has given great effort for HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands during the end of 2004.
It was initially found to have spreads to young children, older people and patients with weak body protection systems with respiratory diseases.
Demonstration of coryza inflammation, heated eye inflammation and pneumonia is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the dispersing of the same virus from a 8-month-old boy’s diverse sample of pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it has actually distributed it across the globe.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its highest rise is at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with coronavirus and hepatitis, known as Croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who had rested in hospitals due to pneumonia and pneumonia in Hong Kong.
Apart from pneumonia and pneumonia obtained by the community of HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with severe hepatitis.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 have been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
Each of these four community-acquired HCoVs has been well adapted in humans and is generally not susceptible to causing high-infectious diseases, although there has been no known incidents as in the rare case of a recent HCoV-NL63 subviral virus reported causing severe respiratory tract infection in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs get the ability to deliver effectively and to keep themselves regularly in humans, they also become less viral or contaminated.
MERS-CoV was first separated in 2012 from 60-year-old pneumonia, which evolved into acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
In most cases, the laboratory is derived from the Middle East, reported cases imported with a second-second spread occasionally due to close contact in countries in Europe and Tunisia.
Another second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
Medical symptoms of MERS are same as SARS, which are characterized by severe pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also evolved into acute kidney disease, which is also unique for MERS among HCoV-born diseases.
More than 30% of patients with gastrointestinal gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported to have 34.4% high mortality rates, making MERS-CoV one of the most viral viruses ever met.
During the middle of December 2019, a group of pneumonia patients who had previously been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The WHO announced the outbreak of low respiratory inflammatory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concerns, and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a total of 3.4% deaths.
It should be noted that the case in Hebei, China, is 4.2% of the percentage out of that is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory tract infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are also shown as fever, cough, and fatigue.
There are also some patients with pandemics.
The pneumonia is one of the other severe symptoms and can rapidly develop into a severe respiratory crisis.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar due to 82% high nucleo sequences, they are deployed as different branches in the rich gene tree.
SARS-CoV-2 looks less pathogenic, but it can be replicated faster than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It has been reported that the subject that have not shown symptoms that are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and can contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparisons and contrasts between SARS-CoV-2 and six other HCoVs show similarities and a variety of great benefits.
First, the period of wake up and the period of HCoV circulation is very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms depends on SARS-CoVs and four HCoVs (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, the SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown some characteristics that are similar to community infections of HCoVs along with a little uncertainty or no symptoms at all.
In other words, it is also possible to see a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases as in SARS-CoV infections, despite a slightly lower ratio.
Third, the replication of SARS-CoV-2 also presents an interesting model of HCoVs and SARS-CoVs obtained from the community.
At least the ability to copy SARS-CoV-2 can be as high as HCoVs obtained by the community.
On the other hand, it is still required to reconfirm whether there is a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 infection after transmission to other people, such as in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Finally, the same as other HCoVs, can be found SARS-CoV-2 in semifinal samples.
Whether the replication of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least under some circumstances, which are still clarified by future studies.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 can be seasoned as a community-acquired HCoVs case.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, plus the infection, including pathogenic infections and its spreads from person to person, will drive the outbreak of COVID-19.
All four HCoVs obtained from communities that cause mild symptoms have well adapted to humans.
In other words, it can be true that people adapt well to these four types of HCoVs.
In other words, both of them can be survivors from the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that cause serious illnesses to people and people who develop to severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
So that all of these things can happen, HCoV must separate itself in the human body to have enough capacity to gather together against the motorbike.
In this sense, when the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is longer and more people pass it, there will be more chances to adapt to people.
If those viruses are able to adapt its well, its replication to humans will be difficult to prevent, even if applying social deviation or other infectious control measures.
Over the years, four types of CoVs have been infectious to people with the same signals as the flu that have strong self-defense immunity.
These viruses don’t need the liver in the animal.
In contrast, high-infected SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted in humans, and their replication in the human body cannot remain stable.
They need to maintain support and breeding in their own cellophane, and find opportunities to spread to a potential target that is more likely to be possible through the intermediate and evolving host.
SARS-CoV-2 features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV groups.
It replicates as quickly as HCoVs obtained in the community, at least for the present time.
However, it is much stronger than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is still seen that it will fully adapt in humans and run in humans without the need for the liver or the central animal host.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV, it will help us well to discuss the definitions and characteristics of natural evolution, central and host evolution to HCoVs.
Animals act as the evolutionary host of HCoV, if it is closely related to fathers who share high symmetrism at the level of a Thai gourmet order.
Often older viruses are well adapted and do not affect the host.
Also, HCoV storage will continue for longer periods of time.
In both cases, the host is usually infected and is the natural host of the HCoV or its original antigen virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV has appeared in the center immediately before or during its appearance to humans, it is not well adapted to new hosts and is often not pathogenic.
This center is a source of animal-to-human infections and acts as a host extension, allowing them to disperse and continue to replicate to humans to expand more oriental replications.
HCoV may stop transmission if the virus cannot be copied from its central host.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the central host and also make longer spreads.
In this case, the central hub becomes a natural storage pool owner.
The data from pandemic studies has previously spread that the SARS index case has a history of exposure to animal-related games.
The results from the blood sample have shown that animal traders have higher anti-SARS-CoV IgG sensitivity compared to the general population.
Monsters and dragons sold in the live market are the first places to be identified as containing viruses such as SARS-CoV, which are almost entirely similar to SARS-CoV.
It has been indirectly supported through unreported facts about SARS, further after killing all wildlife in the market.
However, it has been reported that wild animals from forests or farms without affecting the living animal market are extremely negative to SARS-CoV, suggesting that birds can only act as a central host, but not a natural host of SARS-CoV.
It should be noted that because 80% of different animals on the market in Guangzhou are anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, they cannot include the possibility that many small animals can serve as SARS-CoV’s central scam owner.
All this looks like the last host of SARS-CoV.
Continuous search for SARS-CoV's natural animal hosts has shown close contact with bat CoV, called SARS-related Rhinolophus Bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is available in Chinese horse-bottom bats.
These bats are positive for the anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
The virus and other bat CoVs share 88-92% of the homogenization of nucleotide sequence genes.
These studies form the foundation for new ideas that bats are the human pathogenic agent.
It has also identified many SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) out of bats, but only one defined WIV1 can break down as a live virus.
Human angiotensin enzyme converts 2 enzyme (ACE2), known as SARS-CoV recipients.
WIV1 extracted from bats' sewage samples was shown in the use of bats, bats, iPhones, and people with ACE2 as recipients for cell input.
It’s really interesting that your blood fluid (SERA) is from SARS with the ability to purify WIV1.
Therefore, WIV1 represents the closest subsidiary of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleosterone sequence.
Although these two viruses are very similar, it is still believed that WIV1 is not the origin of SARS-CoV, and bats are not a central SARS-CoV host.
Genetic analysis collects MERS-CoV to the same group as Bat CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV using a single receptor cell, peptidase 4 (DPP4) for viral entry.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is closer to the bat beta-CoV party, which is identified from Europe and Africa.
Until now, the MERS-CoV virus has not been found living in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and CoV-HKU25 in bats, which are the closest memory to share the same size of Thai chrome order only 87%.
So bats may not be the central reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels have an antibodies to MERS-CoV exactly the same as camels that originated in the Middle East in many countries of Africa.
MERS-CoV, which has a similarity to the virus found in humans, has been dispersed from the specimens of camel hormones that further indicate that camels act as a real warehouse pool of MERS-CoV.
It’s also remarkable that generally mild symptoms, but have been observed with a strong transmission of viruses in camels that come with experiments infected with MERS-CoV.
It is worth noting that infected camels have copied the virus not only through the respiratory pathway, but also through the pathways to the mouth, it is also an important port for transmission of the virus from bats.
However, the question remains because many confirmed MERS cases do not have history related to camels before starting with symptoms that are confirmed to be able to replicate to one person or unknown replication pathways related to unknown species that provide shelter to MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of Thai chrome with the CoV RaTG13 in bats separated from the Rhinolophus affinis bats.
Like the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence redirection between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to the class cannot identify the diversity.
These can be said that bats may not be the central host of SARS-CoV-2 unless found CoVs in bats with almost the same identity in the future.
According to SARS-CoV-2, the central animal cultivation of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the species of wild animals sold and killed at the Hangnan Sea accessories wholesale market, most of the first cases of COVID-19 are associated, indicating the event of transmission from animals to humans.
Many recent studies based on memogenic sequences have shown that small species, known as pangolins, can also be sheltered to beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolin coV genomes have a similar share of the 85-92% Thai nutrition order with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they have the same close relationship with RaTG13 with about 90% identity at the level of Thai nutritional order.
They replicate as two small yarns of SARS-CoV-2, like viruses in the hormone of the genome, where a virus has a similar receiving cell to SARS-CoV-2 and 97.4% of the same amino acid.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 vary, although the same genome sequence is more advanced.
Through recent studies studied in pathogenic pests, the presence of virus infections in lung samples is similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different concentration modes as well as an increase in particles of any part of the gene that is approximately 86.3% of the genome size of the virus.
We can’t include that pangolins are a host for replicating SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the origin of SARS-CoV-2 from the breeze, due to the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs in the poultry.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is only shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs in poultry.
It is still not possible to create the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, poultry and other mammals yet.
While the highest-ordered symmetrology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 shares the same size of the highest genome sequence.
There is a strong estimate that the high level of similarity between the RBDs of the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs in poultry and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by a joint evolution that facilitates the selection.
The objection request is instead by the combination of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV in poultry and RaTG13 in the third species of wildlife.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is broad among beta-CoVs.
The judge still has no immediate zunoval origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Apart from the high-infected HCoV, also studied the origin of the zoonotics of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.
Advantages-related evidence has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E can be derived from bat CoVs, while HCoV-OC43’s main virus and HCoV-HKU1 are found in calves.
It was reported that the bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) was found in three-color bats in North America, which showed the same manner as HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has genetics similar to other bat CoVs called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, and was also suspected of camels that it was a continue pathogenic replica.
To clarify the current knowledge of the origin of HCoVs in known animals is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Floral human aquatic analysis has provided evidence for animal-to-human transmission events of HCoVs in history.
It was recorded about the pandemic of respiratory tract infection when HCoV-OC43 passed the animal to replicate people from domestic pets around 1890.
The history of animal-to-human transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Found that alpha-CoVs in bats closely related to HCoV-229E.
Between them there is a alpha-CoV alpaca.
Many evidence recognize transmission of viruses from bats to humans directly.
Firstly, non-oxidants may have contact with bats at a biodiversity that shares together.
Conversely, people have close contact with the Animals of Uranus.
Second, bat alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-infectious elements in bats, whereas Alpha-Cov Alpha-CoV (alpaca alpha-CoV) causes respiratory outbreaks to infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV is not found in the animal itself that is not gasoline.
Thus, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas receive HCoV-related alpha-CoV from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including the virus, the virus, the virus, the virus, the virus, the virus, the virus, and the coronavirus.
So it is not surprising that bats can directly copy HCoV-229E virus to humans.
On the other hand, while alpha-CoVs in bats act as the genome pool of HCoV-229E in the camel of larvaeca and hormones can act as a central host that replicates the virus to humans, rather than in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV acts as an excellent example of transmission from animals to humans from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
MERS-CoV's evolutionary origin from bats at its first identity, and it was expanded through the subsequent discovery.
It is clear that bats provide a rich variety of viruses for interoperative changes of genetic fragments and replications from one category to another.
Long-term living, a large group of wildlife interactions, close together, and high ability to fly is a favorable condition for bats to become an intricate ‘viral spreader.’
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been replicated to camels for decades.
It is well adapted with these camels that have changed from intermediate animals to normal conservation.
MERS-CoV causes extreme mild disease and maintains low rates of change in these animals.
Its irregular replica to humans is a random occurrence, and people are still the last host of MERS-CoV, where its replication cannot be stable.
If there are some contrasts between the role of camels in transmission of MERS-CoV and the role of pangolins in SARS-CoV-2 infections are different.
Especially Beta-CoVs Elliptics are high-infected agents in pangolins.
They can be the last shelf for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs that are similar to an irrigation in SARS-CoV cases.
Many possibilities for animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 must be managed or resolved in future studies.
First, bats can be an warehouse host of SARS-CoV-2, which is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share ecological roles with bats through finding meat or mining.
Second, pangolins can be one of the central viral viral hosts where SARS-CoV-2-related viruses are first copied.
People infected with the virus through animal killing and eating the animal meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Local animal and wildlife surveys for antibodies are guaranteed.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species, which are associated with bats and pangolins.
Search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in animals continues.
In addition to the various types of animal hosts, three major factors on the viral side are also important to facilitate CoVs in crossing animal masks.
First, the high-change rates concerning their RNA replication.
In comparison to a single-wire RNA, CoVs estimated exchange rates may be considered “Medium” to “high” with an average replacement rate from 10 to 4 years per place, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to a new host.
CoVs have a functional nuclei ester that monitors the sterilization that causes extremely high changes and decreases or even ineffective growth.
What’s surprising is that the nucleotide of Remdesivir is known to be able to resist CoV’s dispersion through exoribonuclease enzyme and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme.
Remdesivir is one of the most successful SARS-CoV-2 antiviral agents tested in testing treatment.
However, the rate of complications of the CoVs has a higher level of variations in its host millions of times.
In addition, the exchange rate is often high when CoVs are not well adapted with the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high rate of change rate of SARS-CoV-2 is a lower reality, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It can be said that it is adapted to other hosts near people.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to well adapted MERS-CoV to a plus camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that germs can be refined as vaccine and antiviral drugs that are ineffective quickly.
Second, a large RNA genome in the CoVs has the flexibility that it favours in the separation and reconstruction of itself. Therefore, the evolution from one category to one can occur, which may be favorable in the outbreak of CoVs in a suitable time.
It is supported by a completely different open reading scheme and the converted protein function towards the last 3th genome.
Third, CoVs randomly change the sample profile during RNA’s separation through a different “copy” mechanism.
In the host that serves as a diverse path, the cable switch occurs often during the CoV RNA replication.
The strong homogeneity of full length and subgenio RNAs can be mixed together to form a new CoV.
Proof of a diverse evolution of natural recombination was found both in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal CoVs, such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Viral interactions and hosts are related to copying
In addition to three of the viruses mentioned above, viral interactions with a host cell are another important factor that affects animal-to-human transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV was accepted as a simple example, which also demonstrated positive selection evidence during animal-to-human transmission events.
Based on the comparison analysis between the separateness of humans and SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoVs were thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different storage hosts, especially with the changes in the RBD of S proteins.
Generally, the RBD in the S protein of CoV interacts with the cell receiver and is selected to respond to the human body.
In SARS-CoV RBD is in 318 to 510 amino acids on S1 pieces linked to human ACE2 as well as its core (coreceptors) for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize various ACE 2 stimulating cells, including bats, rats and dogs that allow virus infection.
In fact, only six amino acid residues have been observed differently from the separateness of human viruses and civets in RBD, and they are located in a stimulant cell connector pattern for receiving interactions with ACE2.
SARS-CoV in avocado varies K479N and S487T genes in its RBD, which can enhance the closeness of the interaction of large-type proteins with human ACE2 receptors.
If it comes to the replacement of these two amino acids, these may be important to adapt the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptors with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S proteins confirms that its interconnection of S proteins with people with ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, cryo-EM studies show a higher correlation from 10 to 20 times of the sealing rather than between people with ACE2 and SARS-CoV’s S proteins.
It is also interesting to determine whether other stimulating cells can be required for SARS-CoV-2 replication.
As interesting as HCoV-NL63 also connects to ACE2, but with other parts of S.
There are nerves for getting more HCoV, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of CoVs in humans after transmission from animals to humans from their animal hosts.
In addition to neurons for receiving cells, the results of transmission from animals to humans of HCoVs are also controlled by other host dependence factors and other limitations.
The variety of main proteins between humans and mains of natural storage pools of HCoVs, such as bats, camels, dromedary camels and coconuts, can be a barrier to transmission between one type to another.
HCoVs must take the parent's dependence factor and turn the host's tightening factor for successful integrated transmission.
In this sense, the molecular determining factor in the main part of the interaction of the virus remains identified and identified.
Unbiased genome control of host dependence and restrictive factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the modern technology of CRISPR may receive flowers.
Outbreak of new HCoVs: Back to zero levels
The variety of bat CoVs offers a great deal of opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs act as HCoVs' genome basin.
In addition, rapid and resumption of genes also promotes HCoV evolution and acts as two key steps in the process.
For example, receiving or losing genes that make new protein codes have a potential to significantly modify protein genes.
ORF8 among the other SARS-CoV proteins were marked as essential to human body adaptation, like SARS-CoV, which was isolated from bats, but was found to have different Orf8 protein conversions.
It has been found the characteristics of the 29-nucleotide deletion of SARS-CoVs in a broken cable at the beginning of human pandemic.
This cancellation transforms ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, which is understood as an adaptation that drives host change (the body of storage).
In addition, SARS-CoV has a recombination history with alpha threads and gamma-CoVs, where many small combination regions are known in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination position is also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and various parts of nsp14.
Also, it has been shown that the spread of MERS-CoV experienced a recombination event between various threads that occurred in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reconciliation events are also observed in other HCoV, in which HCoV integrates with other animal CoVs in unstructured genetics.
Choosing by craftsmanship should be taken with caution because it can cause inadvertently altering the virus's genes that can be caused by a decrease in the virus through the pressure of choosing such as the host's immune system.
Examples of these effects are the full size loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E model line caused by the removal of the second nuclei.
While ORF4 can be observed in bat virus and camel related to HCoV-229E, Alpha CoV Alpaca (alpaca alpha-CoV) shows a single inclusion of Thai chromatography (nucleotide) that causes a profile change.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by the selection of pressure in their stock pools.
Influencing symptoms or mild symptoms have been found when bats are infected with CoVs, which demonstrates a sensitivity between CoVs and bats.
It has shown that bats are well adapted to CoVs' Physics and Physics.
For example, the difference in the activation of anti-inflammatory responses in bats effectively reduces the pathogens caused by CoVs.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to increasing cell responses of cells receiving stimulation of NKG2/CD94 natural killer cells and low resistance levels of complex first-class molecules of main different tissues.
In addition, the high-reactive oxygen type (ROS) generated from bats' high-metallic activity can prevent the transmission of CoV and affect the diagnosis by the exoribonuclease, thus providing the selection pressure for the formation of high-infectious virus when entering a new host.
Many other pathogens of the CoV group can also evolve by re-assembling, leading to new proteins or proteins that are featured in adaptation to its host.
So it’s not random that three HCoVs have emerged over the past two decades.
CoVs are non-infectious agents, or it just causes mild symptoms in host bats such as bats and camels, etc.
They make a strong copy without making a strong response to the immunity of the host.
Here’s the secret of detecting an unconditional replication agent and the cause of cases infected with severe people.
Most severe symptoms caused by a reduction in the immune system and the number of cytokine responses, which make the lung damage more severe.
On the other hand, if you contain the virus, there is no symptoms, it means that the immune system does not have any activity related to the clarification of CoV.
The same strategy to cut off the response of the immune system can have a good effect on treating against SARS-CoV-2.
The response of the inflammation is very strong, especially in bats.
Thus, the use of type I of interferon signal release protein at least at the first stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection for humans should benefit.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 in bats has no effect.
According to this reason, preventing NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 can be useful to treat COVID-19.
The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 is according to the general section where SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV occur.
Beta-CoV has distributed 95% of the same nuclei as the SARS-CoV we found. Also, Beta-CoV has distributed 96% of the same nuclei to SARS-CoV-2.
Infants and other animals in the market were found to have the same collection of viruses to SARS-CoV, but the central host for SARS-CoV-2 was not identified.
Beta-CoVs are highly similar to SARS-CoV-2, which shows that pangolins can serve as one of the many hosters, or Beta-CoVs, which can help deliver genetic dividends to the last generation of SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
Although there is still no question, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is intentionally created, human or random.
CoVs have returned to excellence due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
Studies about CoVs in bats and other animals have greatly changed our perception of the importance of origins of human-to-human transmission and HCoVs storage in human transmission.
Spread evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are native to bats and are delivered to humans through central hosting.
Due to SARS-CoV infection, the origin of the relationship between humans and civets (like cats) in the market, closing the market that sells meat and wet places and killing civets should be able to effectively end the SARS pandemic.
For the same reason, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent less zoonotic infections (from animals to humans) due to a wide range of sights of the generations of beta-CoVs, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, how and whether SARS-CoV-2 is copied to humans through poultry and other mammals are still clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels serve as an important tool for transportation as well as the main source of milk, skin products, and wool for locals.
They are highly spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to kill all camels to control MERS like what is done in the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the outbreak of renewable MERS, there should be a method to develop effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
Because we can’t eliminate these new genotypes, it may emerge as a result of the outbreak.
A variety of coVs that are replicated from animals to many species are circulating in the forest.
In particular, bat CoVs that can be copied from animals to humans are different.
There are many opportunities that these CoVs may develop or regeneration that cause new CoVs that can make future replications and deaths.
China should have to abandon the culture of eating wildlife in some parts of the country to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Preparation and better response plans should be available with the painful experience of SARS, MERS and COVID-19.
In fact, many viruses have been in the planet for a long time.
They impose in their normal host until there is a chance to emulate the replication.
Although bats have many features that help spread the virus, people can reduce the chances of communicating with bats and other wildlife as a minimum if they have education away from those animals.
Unstoppable surveillance to mammals is necessary for a clearer understanding of CoVs’ ecological ecosystems and its natural host, which will show the benefit of preventing animal infections to humans and future outbreaks.
In total, the effective method of preventing animal infections is that humans must stay away from the ecological region where infected viruses come to humans.
It is still not found many pieces in the puzzle of the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats replicate SARS-CoV-2 to poultry, it is interesting to see how bats and poultry can be similar to ecological minutes.
Second, if bats play the most direct role in transmission to humans, they should control how humans are connected to bats.
Third, if the third mammal acts as the central host, it determines how it interacts with various species, including bats and poultry.
Some mammals, including home pets, are also vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infections, should be conducted.
If a bat, poultry, or other mammals expect SARS-CoV-2 or its original aging virus, almost the same will be set in the normal host of the future.
Continuing the investigation in this section will help to show how SARS-CoV-2 evolves in the animal itself, which is significantly related to preventing and managing COVID-19 for humans.
The update of COVID-19 "skeptical cases" and "infectious cases" is necessary
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guideline for diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infections 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guide provides our experience and as a reference for combating this pandemic worldwide.
But coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, understanding, and knowledge that is increasing in order based on the results of ongoing research and practical experience. Therefore, the strategy of diagnosis and treatment is also updated continuously.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest criteria of the “conscious case” and “infected case” according to the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (7th version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak that was now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named a severe respiratory disease called Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick guideline and has been published online in military medical research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a great interest since the release.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, understanding, and knowledge that is increasing in order based on ongoing research results and clinical practice experience, so the strategy of diagnosis and treatment is also updated continuously.
For example, the introduction of diagnosis and treatments for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020) issued a total of seven publications that some contexts have been changed greatly.
Now, our guidelines have received comments by Zhou et al, they introduced simple score requests based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence for our guidelines and is also a valuable reference to the disease worldwide.
We support their main work and thank you.
But their work also needs updates according to the latest guidelines of diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19 (Strucial Test Version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), to confirm suspected cases, need to combine any of the history characteristics of pandemics with two elements of symptoms to do a comprehensive analysis or need to meet three symptoms if the history of the pandemic is not clear:
Symptoms: (1) History of travel or accommodation in Wuhan and other surroundings or communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before symptoms. (2) The history of communication with SARS-CoV-2 infection cases (with positive nuclear acid tests). (3) The history of contact with fever patients or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and other surrounding areas or communities with COVID-19 reports in the last 14 days before symptoms. (4) The history of contact with clusters of infectious cases (≥2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurred within 2 weeks in small areas such as office homes, etc.).
Medical symptoms display: (1) hot fever and/or respiratory symptoms. (2) With images with features of COVID-19 infection. (3) Total blood cells show normal decreases or decreases the number of leukemia at the initial stage.
Diagnostics on cases of infection should be based on suspected case with any evidence of disease or the following evidence: (1) positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 (2) the whole genome sequence of the virus demonstrates a high similarity to known coronavirus (3), positive to the specific IgM enzyme, and specific IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in a ceramic test or SARS-CoV-2’s specific IgG exchange from negative to positive or uprising ≥4 times in the recovery phase above, which is in a hypertensive phase.
We can see that the replication polymerasic reaction test for nucleic acid in a pipeline or blood sample is entered into the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The discovery of the pathogenic element of the blood sample was entered into the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020), and then evidence of blood analysis was entered into the seventh edition.
These changes are based on researchers who continue to work to find the optimal nuclear acid detector for rapid diagnosis as well as samples from respiratory tubes, including taking blood samples that increase the availability of various samples and help bring positive results of the enzyme into the infection criteria.
In addition, there are more evidence that encourage us to be careful with patients with common and without symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou’s flow chart et al. should be updated because they consider people who do not have “low-risk clinical symptoms”.
The score system also needs to be verified in practice and further clinical studies.
To finish, we hope that more direct evidence will arrive and call for readers to give their suggestions.
For the diagnosis of "skeptical cases" and "infectious cases" we recommend tracking and following the latest guidelines of their native country.
Our team will update our instructions in time to provide help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed that there were five new deaths due to COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of deaths per day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the Institute for Fighting Monitoring and Research of Tropical Diseases (IEDCR) of Bangladesh has reported that the number of confirmed cases including 114 active cases and 33 healing cases are staying home.
The total number of 17 deaths was recorded.
Through the online briefing program, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that deaths include four men and women.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two other cases are between 51 and 60 years old and another 41-50 years old.
She also said that two victims were from Dakah.
On March 11, World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
Hospital officials told the Anadolu Agency, a local media agency that one of the dead was the president of the Bengali Anti-corruption Committee, who was taken care of at the Vejthani Hospital.
On Saturday in a video announcement on the Internet, Minister of Railway Transport and Bangladesh Bridge, Obaidul Quader said public transport will be closed for longer than planned until Saturday.
The public closure began on March 26th and planned to finish on Saturday 4th April.
Shipping important goods such as medical, petroleum and food are still allowed.
The first recorded on 8 March showed that there were cases of Covid-19 infection in Bangladesh that were born on two people who returned from Italy, a woman, a wife of one of them, also infected the disease.
These three were healed and as of March 19th.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more than one million people worldwide
According to data from Johns Hopkins University on Thursday, the number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infected people increased by more than one million people around the world.
At least 52 thousand people have died, associated with COVID-19 caused by coronavirus.
An important event occurred on the same day, Malawi confirmed its first virus infection, and Zambia had the first coronavirus-related deaths.
North Korea confirmed on Thursday that it is one of some countries that still have no coronavirus infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported that there were 1,051,635 confirmed cases in which 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours before 10am in Central Europe (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand cases of coronavirus infection have died involving the disease.
CBS reportedly extracting data from Johns Hopkins University that more than 1,000 people died on Wednesday caused by coronavirus infections.
Around the world, many countries have announced strict measures to prevent the disease from spreading.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Mayor of Moscow, continued to close the city door until May 1st.
Over the country, President Vladimir Puthin announced that Russians will be paid without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese state has voted to postpone the state’s temporary announcements by 15 days, votes approved by 215 voice, support, ten votes, and an anti-sound.
Saudi Arabia added a syphilis in the main cities of Mecca and Medina, which lasted all day. Earlier, the syphilis was effective between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.
Thailand plans to carry out the waterway between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio’s governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had postponed the order to stay in the house until May 1st.
Stores in Australia have a low degree of paper use per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian shop Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchases on toilet paper to two and one package per transaction in all stores at national level.
On Monday, the ALDI supermarket also introduced “One Package” restrictions.
These limits are posted as messages on the checklist and on the Facebook page chain.
Customers are reportedly buying stocks because of the fear of COVID-19 in case they need to stay separate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for shipping to the house of only one package per order.
These changes were followed by the four-box restriction rules to purchase once before, recommended by Woolworths and Coles on 4th and 5th separate.
"In the media release on its 8 March, Coles Market reported that with four restrictions, ""many stores still sell out of stock in one hour of transportation""" and called the demand "Never before" while the ALDI supermarket called it "unexpected" in the Twitter post on Tuesday." "
According to Woolworths’ spokesperson, the sales had been “increasingly increasing” last week.
Costco’s store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to be two packages last week.
To reduce the loss of Coles ordered a large package from the supplier and increase the demand for Woolworths shipping, ordered additional stock while ALDI created stocks for the project planned for the predecessor.
Russell Zimmerman, president of Australia’s retailer, said the retailer tried to bring stock in stock, but the local board’s restrictions as the carrier entered was difficult.
He expects production costs to grow because suppliers try to meet the requirements and have less special skills.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the first stock release, some shops could not run a special Wednesday program.
In the News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from the University of Minnesota Technologies, said that these stores fill stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a cosmetic, which leads to less quantities and when sold, leaving large baggage stores left behind, making it a lack of it.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC news that, "Colales and Wolves have a view [that] if there are many items on the shelf, if the products such as toilet coughs and plate paints can be purchased, and you may be able to reduce much danger."
Who Gives a Crap, who produces toilet paper made of recycled paper, said on Wednesday that they're out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which manufactures Kleenex Toilet Tissue and Solaris Paper and produces sewage materials, confirmed that they are working 24/7 to keep supply according to the News.com.au website report.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that real estate sellers offer free paper use to the first person in the Melbourne Auction Ceremony when a few auctions took place because the buyer rested at the weekend of the Labour Day.
The release of the NT News newspaper on Thursday printed daily in Darwin, including an eight-page input, which means to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
Initially, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions according to reports from ABC Australia on March 3 by saying they had no plans to restrict the purchase.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have high demand, including masks, sanitary masks, drying products, hands and powders.
Similarly, Sunday evening outside Australia, the UK’s online Ocado mall was observed to have restrictions on the purchase of paper for the Andres brand toilets up to two 12 pieces.
WHO announces COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the virus caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term "campire" refers to how the disease has spread and not just to the specific cases of such danger, the World Health Organization has noted the need to push the government to take action:
“ All countries can still change the direction of the pandemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the World Health Organization, said that if countries find treatment tests separate and gather their people in response.”
“We are deeply concerned with both the level of emergency declaration of spread and severity and the level of inactivation.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic has said that the pandemic is "the never before."
In his speech published by CN TV in February, “outside colds there are no other respiratory viruses that have been tracked from emergence until the worldwide spread continues.”
Ghebreyesus showed similar perceptions by saying, “We have never seen the pandemic caused by coronavirus before.”
"He continued, "And we never saw the pandemic managed at the same time."
The new situation, a pandemic that follows WHO’s decision in January, declared that the spread of the disease was a temporary condition on public health, is in international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Management, Alzheimer and U.S. Infectious Disease, said about the outbreak of the disease, "it will be more serious."
As of Thursday, the press agency reported at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, causing more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is a continued pandemic of 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by two severe respiratory symptoms of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak of the disease was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency of international concerns on January 30, 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases have been reported from 210 countries and regions, about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The memory rate is approximately 4% in China, while for the global refund is between 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and short breath.
The consequences can include pneumonia and severe respiratory symptoms.
From the time of exposure to patients until symptoms are usually known within five days, but can be found between two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The first phase treatment is the treatment depending on symptoms and support. The recommended preventive way to use include washing the mouth when the cough keeps distance from others and monitors and stays separate for those who suspect they have been infected.
Worldwide authorities responded by implementing restrictions on travel, deploying separate, banning, monitoring of hazards in workplaces and closures.
The pandemic has caused problems with global social economies, times or abolition of sports, political and cultural events, and the lack of supply caused by fear.
Schools and universities have blocked nationwide or regionally in 193 countries, affecting the number of students around the world about 99.4 percent.
The false information about the virus has been published online, and it also has incidents of fear of foreigners and Chinese discrimination, other people native to East Asia and Southeast Asia, and those who look similar to others from infected areas.
Due to reducing travel and heavy-resistant industrial closures, causing a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported the cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown causes on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was started in early January 2020.
This case is mainly related to the market wholesale of seafood, Hunan, and so the virus is thought to have origins of Zhou.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2 is a recent virus that is closely related to coronavirus in bats of coronaviruses in pangolins and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was found later that he fell ill on December 1, 2019, and that person was not directly exposed to the group of viruses found in the wet market.
In the early clusters of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds of patients were found sourced from the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post said that a case occurred on 17 November 2019, 55-year-old from Hubei province might have been the first case. On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that the new case was reported to have fallen in China, but immediately there was an increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China increased over the number of new cases in China for the first time.
It may not have been reported about cases of infection, especially in those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, some cases were reported among the 19-year-old youth and under 2.4% of global cases. The UK scientific advisor Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the British people would be infected before achieving group-effective immunity.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and their tests have been confirmed to have positive results according to the official protocol.
As of 23 March, no country has tested its population for 3 percent, and many countries have issued a formal policy that does not test those who issue mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China until 23 January, approximately 86% of COVID-19 infections were not found, and the unrecognizable infection was the source of 79% replication of recorded cases.
Statistics analysis released on March 30 estimates that the number of infections in Italy is more than the reported case.
The initial estimate of the base reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
Studies published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention have concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 have already recovered.
For countries with no time of symptoms evolution until death is between 6 and 41 days with the most common time is 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths were caused by COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5th, about 80% of deaths are over 60 years old, and 75% have heart disease and existing diabetes. The official number of deaths from COVID-19 pandemics generally refers to those who have tested positives that have COVIDs according to the official protocol.
The number of real deaths due to COVID-19 may be more because it does not include people who die without testing – e.g. at home in care, etc.
Part data from Italy found that the number of deaths exceeded during pandemic exceeds the total number of deaths covered by the official service by the 4-5x factor.
“We know that [the number of deaths] is a mild view” a statement stated by reporting countless US counts. Such mild viewing often occurs when there is pandemic, such as H1N1 in 2009. The first death in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14th.
Until February 28th outside China, many mainland deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Many measures were used to determine the number of deaths.
These numbers vary by regional and over time and are influenced by the number of health system quality tests, the choice of treatment time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and general health. Reflection on the number of mortality divided by the number of cases diagnosed during the given time period.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the ratio of global deaths is 6.0% (97.039/1617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
Number of different figures to the region.
In China, estimates of the mortality ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms starting from 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms starting after 1 February 2020). Other measures include case death rates (CFR), which reflect the percentage of those who have diagnosed deaths due to disease and infection rates (IFR), which reflect the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed), which died due to the disease.
These statistics do not schedule and track specific people from infection through case solutions.
Some studies have tried to calculate these numbers for a specific population.
The evidence-based medical center of the University of Aerosol estimates the mortality rate of infection to the whole pandemic ranges from 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above estimates of this range are consistent with the results from first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany and statistical studies, analyzing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be managed.
The top and last period of the outbreak is unclear and can vary by location.
Maciej Boni, at Penn State University, said: “With the rest of the non-controls, the outbreaks of the disease rise, then begin to reclaim when the disease is out of the disease.
But it’s almost impossible to make reasonable estimates right now about the time that will happen.”
China’s Senior Health Advisor Zhong Nanshan stated, “It may end in June,” if all countries can be gathered to follow the World Health Organization’s advice on the measures to stop the spread of the virus.
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, from the School of Pharmaceuticals and Sanitary, said SARS-CoV-2 ""will continue to break within one or two years." "
"According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, the physical gap and other measures will need ""until there is a vaccine available (heavy 18 months or longer).""
William Schaffner, from Vanderbilt University, said: "I think it may not be possible that the coronavirus—because it's ready for replication—it won't go away completely," and it "can be turned into seasonal disease, allowing it to come back every year."
The momentum of the pandemic can come back depending on the immunity of the human group and the size of the variation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be related to uncertainty, and infected individuals may not have any other symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are heated (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Unrecognizable symptoms include fatigue, fluid production in the respiratory system (phlegm), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle overheart, and dry joints, headache, cough, cough, cough out of the blood, cyst, or skin change. WHO said that about one of the six people had severe pain and difficulty breathing.
The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms such as inhalation difficulties, persistent chest pain or diarrhea, immediate turmoil, wake-up and face or blue-shaped lips. Emergency medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present. Continuous evolution of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, severe respiratory symptoms, hypothesis, neurological, and loss of life.
Some infected people may not have symptoms, but there are tests that confirm infections, so researchers have advised that people with close relationships with infected people should be monitored and monitored to prevent infection.
Chinese estimates about the ratio of non-expression are little up to 44%.
Normal wake-up period (time between infections and symptoms starting) ranges from day to day 14 days, for example, generally of five days. An example of uncertainty estimates the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lose their first scent of 30% and then fall 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are yet to be determined.
The disease is believed to be primarily spread during closeness and by small droplets produced during the cough or talk with close relationships between 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that non-slip coughs can lead to tears from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 meters).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be infected by small droplets that are long in the environment, which can be created during speech. The lubrication droplet can also be produced during the respiration, including when speaking, even though the virus is generally not replicated by air.
Orals may fall on the mouth or nose of people near or can absorb into the lungs by breathing.
Some medical procedures such as intramuscular intramuscular injection and cardiovascular resilience (CPR) may cause a breath-respiratory drop out of the needle and may cause air spread.
It can also spread when a person touches the dirt surface, including the skin, and then touches their nose or mouth.
While there are concerns that it can spread by the source of this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government declined to the possibility of oral infection of SARS-CoV-2. The virus was most in the first three days after the beginning of the symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms emerged and at the later stage of the disease.
People have tested positive that the disease is up to three days before the beginning of symptoms that indicate that infection is possible before the evolution of major symptoms.
Only some reports of cases without symptoms are confirmed by the laboratory, but synchronous transmission is determined by some countries during the monitoring investigation.
The Center for Prevention and Disease Control (ECDC) stated that while it is still not entirely clear how the disease spreads a person can replicate to people from two to three. The virus can live for hours until several days on the surface.
Clearly, the virus has been found to be able to live on plastic bags (polypropylene) for three days and 304 hours on stainless steel for one day on carton and up to four days on copper.
However, this point varies depending on the humidity and temperature. Otherស្រុក and animal have tested positive that there are COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can replicate the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after having contact with animals such as after having other exterior relationships with infected people.
Severe respiratory inflammation caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the first ever known virus, isolated from three people with pneumonia related to a severe respiratory case in Wuhan.
All features of SARS-CoV-2 are available in coronavirus-related viruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus will be eliminated by indoor soaps that can dissolve its protective pills. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
The disease is thought to have been born from animal infection.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus has genetic clusters with betacoronavirus (Betacoronavirus), which are among the borroviruses (B varieties) together with two species of bats.
It has 96 percent of the same status at the genome level to other pupils of bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one variety of amino acids in the specific part of the genome between viruses from pangolins and genes from humans.
The whole comparison of genes found that almost 92% of genomes distributed between pangolins and SARS-CoV-2, which were insufficient to confirm that poultry had an intermediate homeowner.
Viral infections can temporarily diagnose based on the first symptom, although the final confirmation is made by the negative coronavirus of the polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the copied material or CT recording.
A study of the comparison between the polymerasic reactions to CT in Wuhan showed that the city is more sensitive than the polymerasic cable reaction, with many features of its images overlaping with pneumonia and other disease processes, although not specific.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology introduced that “CT should not be used to examine or not be the first option to test COVID-19.”
The World Health Organization released several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2 with the first release on January 17.
Test using reverse polymer replication cable reaction (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be done on samples by respiratory or blood.
Generally, results are available within a few hours to a day.
Generally, this test is carried out on a diverse collision bottle brush, even though the sprinkling bottles can also be used. The number of laboratories and companies are developing sequential tests found in the organisms.
As of 6 April 2020, these documents did not confirm enough to be approved for general use.
In the United States, sequential testing was developed by Cisco approved to be immediately used by the confirmed laboratory only.
Features of images on the X-ray and Tomography Reflection (CT) on people with symptoms include aluminum, glass on the ground and non-light ecological.
The Italian Radiological Society is collecting international online data on image detection for specified cases.
Due to overlapping with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging simulations without confirmation of PCR are specific to identify COVID-19.
A large study in China compared CT’s original test results with PCR and showed that although images are less specific for transmission, it is faster and stronger reactions by recommending that its testing is a test tool in the pandemic.
The neuron network based on the solutions of artificial brains were created to capture images of viruses with both radio and CT.
Strategies in preventing disease replication include good personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching, nose or mouth without washing, and coughing, or coughing, using a mouth wiped paper, and removing the mouth wiped paper into the trash immediately.
Those who may have already been infectious are advised to wear a public surgical mask.
The measures to put people apart are also recommended to prevent infection. Many governments have imposed or instructed the ban on travel if not necessary to exit and enter countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stages of community spread in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community, and some community members don’t know where they go and where they are going. Healthcare providers who are taking care of someone who may be infected with the virus are advised to use standard communication and eye protection. Communication monitoring is an important method for the health authorities to identify the source of infection and to prevent further infection.
Using location data from the government for this purpose has made privacy concerns by international exclusion organizations and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for a limit on this type of surveillance.
Mobile applications are applied or offered for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, many teams are working on privacy solutions such as using Bluetooth to locate near users.
Users will get a message if they have close contact with someone who has tested positive that there is COVID-19. The misconceptions that are promoting the way to prevent infection. For example, mixed washing and mouth washing with detergents are ineffective.
There are no vaccine vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working on creating this vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends people to wash hands frequently with soaps and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after entering the toilet or when the hand can see dirt before eating and after sweating, cough or cough.
This is because outside the human body the virus is killed by the family soap, which makes its protective bubble blasting.
CDC further recommends using 60% alcohol hand washing water when there are no available soaps and water.
WHO recommends people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
On various surfaces can be washed by some mixtures (in one minute after need of microfiber diet for stainless steel surfaces), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% sodium hydrochloride, 0.1% hydrogen, peroxide 0.5%, and polypropylene iodine 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a suspected case or confirmed COVID in places such as office or daily care, such as the bathroom office, shared electronic devices, such as tablets, touch screens, devices, controls, and ATMs used by patients, should be shot to kill the virus.
Health organizations advise people to lock their mouths and nose them with a bowed to the wrist or use the paper to wipe their mouths when coughing or coughing and throwing the paper immediately.
Medical masss are recommended for those who may be infected with the disease by wearing masks can be limited to the amount of infectiousness and degradation of fluids when speaking chills and coughs.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued instructions on time and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a studyer of the virus at Leeds University, “wearing masks can reduce the tendency of people from touching their faces, a major source of infections without proper hand hygiene.” The mass is also recommended for those who take care of those who may cause this disease.
The World Health Organization recommends healthy wear masks in case of high risks such as caregivers, COVID-19 patients. However, they also recognize that wearing masks can help people avoid their face exposure.
Some countries have begun to encourage face masking by public members.
In the U.S., CDC has been linked to wearing masks made of non-medical cloths. China has specifically introduced to the public, especially for those with close contact (1 meters (3 feet) or closer) with others to use disposable medical masks.
Hong Kong recommends wearing masks when people travel through a public transport system or when in a position with a lot of people.
Thai health officials encourage people to get out of the cloth at home and wash it daily.
The Czech and Slovak public state bans the ban on the public without wearing masks or packing noses and mouths.
On 16 March, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going to the public area to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government ordered that everyone who enters the store must wear masks.
Israel asked all people to wear masks when they were in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masss per day since mid-March, requires passengers on trains and buses to wear masss on April 1st.
Panama requires wearing masks all the time out, and also recommend manufacturing handmade masks for those who cannot buy masks.
Mass is widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social deviation (or known as distance from each other) includes measures for managing replications that are intended to slow down the spread of the disease by reducing close relationship between one person to one person.
Methods include quarantines, restrictions on travel and school closures, workplaces, theaters, or shopping centers, etc.
Individuals can apply social gaping methods by staying at home, the level of travel, avoiding places where a lot of people use welcomes, without exposure, and devising themselves away from others.
Many governments are now determining or recommending social gaps in the affected area of the outbreak.
The maximum concentration size recommended by the U.S. government and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 (if there were no COVID-19 spreads in the region) to 50, and later to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings from two people. Adults and people with diabetes such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, blood disease, and acute immune system facing high risks of severe disease and many consequences. By the end of March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health organizations began to replace the use of the term "social gap" with "retention of physical gaps" to confirm that the purpose is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social relationships either near or away.
The use of the term "social deviation" has led to the effects that people should be involved in completely socially isolated, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through other methods. Some authorities have announced sexual health guidance for use during the pandemic.
These include recommendations for sex only with those you live with without viruses or symptoms of the virus.
Self-soccupation at home is recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected to have been infected.
Health agencies have announced detailed instructions for proper separate accommodation. Many governments have ordered or advised to make self-glycerides for all people living in the infected area.
Introducing separate themselves was announced to those in a high-risk group.
Those who may have been exposed to COVID-19, and those who have just traveled to a country or region with intense spreads have been advised to prevent themselves from being separate for 14 days from the time of last exposure.
The strategy of managing the outbreak of the disease is to manage the situation, crack and reduce severity.
This is carried out in the early stages of diarrhea and aims to track and separate infected people as well as guide various measures of managing, replicating and vaccinating vaccines to stop the disease from spreading to the entire population.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, the effort is then reaching a reduced stage: measures are taken to reduce the spread and reduce its impact on health and social care systems.
Combination of both status management measures and severity reductions may be performed at the same time.
Cracking requires a stronger measure to avoid pandemic by reducing the number of reproductives to less than 1 percent of the disease’s spread control is trying to reduce the highest level of spread, known as the lower curve of spread.
This reduces the risk of difficult health services and provides extra time for the formation of vaccine and treatment.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage this outbreak include personal protection measures such as hand hygiene, face masks, and corrosion, community measures aim to keep away from the body, such as school closures, and cancels large concentration events. Community engagement to boost acceptance and participation in such interventions. Many activities that are targeted to withstand the outbreak of the disease are carried out in China when the severity of the outbreak emerged, such as the entire city placement and strict travel ban.
Other countries have also adopted different measures that are intended for the spread of the virus.
South Korea has conducted large-scale inspections and blocked locally isolated and issued a notice on the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore has provided financial support for those infected and quarantine, and has issued a sharp fine on those who have not followed.
Taiwan has increased face mass production and fines on medical stock purchases. Patterns for the UK and the United States show that reductions (reducing but do not stop pandemic spreads) and cracks (reducing pandemic growth) have major challenges.
The optimal reduction policy can reduce the highest healthcare needs by 2/3 and half death, but still causes hundreds of thousands of people to die, and the health system is inflammation.
Action restrictions may be selected and necessary as long as the virus is spread to humans (or until the vaccine is available before) when the transmission is increased rapidly when the measure is relaxed.
Long-term intervention to prevent the pandemic from causing social and economic loss.
There are no specific antiviral drugs yet approved for COVID-19, but ongoing development efforts, including existing medication tests.
Using overdose cooling drugs, drinking water and relaxation can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen treatment, intravenous fluid injection and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids can make the results worse.
Many of the previously approved compounds for the treatment of other viruses are being investigated for use in COVID-19 treatment.

The outbreak of coronavirus has been blamed for many reasons, such as the lack of supply, starting from increasing use of materials to combat purchasing diseases, with fear and problems on factories and global transportation operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about the lack of drugs and medical equipment due to the increase in consumer demand and disruption to suppliers.
Many areas have also seen that there are strenuous purchases that lead to all the purchases on major spices from shelves such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which cause a lack of supply.
Some technology industries have been warned about delaying electronic goods.
According to Tedros Adhanom, WHO General Directorate, a requirement for personal protective materials has increased 100 times.
This requirement has raised up to twenty times of normal price and also caused a delay in medical supplies for four to six months.
It has also caused a lack of personal protective equipment worldwide by the World Health Organization warning that it will harm health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for conventional buyers to sell their products to China.
This activity has developed a shortage of baby milk powders in modern and final markets, sanctioned by the Australian government. Although the pandemic of COVID-19 cases has been advanced in northern Italy and Wuhan region, the demand for food products has increased continuously, these areas have been out of severe food shortages.
China and Italy's measures against illegal and illegal products trading have succeeded by avoiding the lack of hypertensive foods expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, its main agricultural production, is not much reduced, but prices may increase according to industry representatives.
Food shelf has been temporarily sold, even in Wuhan, while Chinese government officials have released pork meat to ensure food reserves to the people.
Similar laws are available in Italy that require food producers to store reserves for such emergency.
Destruction to the world economy was seen in China: According to media reports on 16 March, China’s economy suffered a significant impact in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures in reducing the spread of viruses and retail sales. Sales fell 20.5%.
By China, mainland is the main part of the economy and production of the outbreak of the disease, it is seen as a major threat to destabilize the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that the market will remain stable until clear images appear on potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that a global pandemic could exceed the outbreak of SARS 2002–2004.
One estimate from experts at Washington University in St. Louis provides more than $300 billion impact on the world supply chain that can last up to two years.

The Mohamed El-Erian economies praised the timely measures of central and state banks.
The central bank took action faster than they did in the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism sectors suffer the worst among other sectors due to the ban on closure of public places, including tourism attractions and government advice against worldwide travel.
As a consequence, many airlines cancelled flights due to low demand including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas while British regional airlines Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the boating industry is in a ever-ever level.
Several railway terminals and canal ports are also closed.
The pandemic takes place simultaneously with the Condominium Festival, an important travel season involving the Chinese New Year holiday.
Many events related to a large crowd were cancelled by the national and regional government, including the New Year Festival with private companies, also closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
New Year's Festival and many tourist attractions are closed to block mass collections including the ancient Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple festivals.
24 of China’s 31 provinces and provinces have postponed New Year’s Holiday to 10 February, which introduced most of the workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These areas represent 80% of total domestic products of the country and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong increased its level of response to the infection to the highest level and posted a temporary period by closing the school until March and canceling all the year’s celebrations. The retail sector suffered global impact with a reduction of sales hours or closures.
Go to the retail place in Europe and Latin America, down 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East have seen a 50–60% decline.
This also causes 33–43% decline in foot traffic to the shopping market in March, compared to February.
Supermarket operators around the world have put out additional measures such as hygiene increases thermal drum installation to check the temperature of shoppers and eliminate events. According to the estimates of the United Nations Economic Commission for the US Lath crisis caused by the spread of pandemic can be between 14 and 22 million people in more poverty in Latin America than in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the high massage in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many Chinese rural migrant workers with nearly 300 million were home in mainland province or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost jobs and filed a request for assistance from the government.
Coronavirus outbreaks can cause 47 million jobs loss in the United States, and the rate of unemployment rates can increase by 32% according to the forecast of Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Residentialization in India has caused ten million Indian migrants to lose their jobs (which they receive daily payouts). Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian families experienced unemployment experience. About 900,000 employees in Spain have lost their jobs since the country ordered people home in mid-March 2020.
During the mid-March, 4 million French employees filed for temporary non-employment benefits, and 1 million UK employees filed a global credit project. About half a million companies in Germany sent their employees into a short-term work plan with government sponsorships, known as Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term work compensation scheme is approved by France and the UK.
Arts and cultural heritage sectors are deeply affected by pandemics that affect organizational operations as well as individuals—both jobs and independence—all over the world.
Arts and culture organizations have tried to improve their mission (usually funded in public) to provide access to cultural heritage to the communities that take care of their employees and the public and support the artists as possible.
By March 2020, all over the world and at all levels, museums, facilities, performances and other cultural institutions are completely closed by their event and performance exhibitions, cancelled or delayed.
In response, there is a great effort to provide alternative services through the digital platform. The decline of the disease has been faster and faster recently, the abolition of major events in sports and social events, such as music festivals and concerts, tech conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced a deterioration. Boravaty Wheel has announced that pure week performance in Rome, which took place in the last week of the religious season, was cancelled.
Many churches have provided services through radio, live broadcasts, online or TV, while others can be worshiped by the opening of the church.

The pandemic has caused the most noticeable disruption to the world’s sporting table since World War II.
Most major sporting events are cancelled or delayed, including 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019–20 NBA season, and 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted the plan for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which originally planned to start at the end of July. The International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will be reset after 2020, but no longer than the summer 2021. Casino and other gaming facilities all over the world have closed and the game was delayed or cancelled.
This activity has made many gaming players change to online, with many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in new registry rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected by various bands suspended or cancelled concert trips.
Many major theaters such as Broadway also suspended performances.
Some artists have found ways to continue manufacturing and sharing work online by considering it as an alternative to direct performance such as live concerts on the internet or creating festivals on the "website" for artists to perform, distribute and display their work.
Online, funny images on the Internet related to coronavirus have spread greatly by many like to laugh and to turn around when there is no uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, increased fear of foreigners and racial discrimination has been noted to Chinese people and people who originated in East Asia and to the people from countries that are infectious in Europe, the United States and other countries.
The incident of fear, suspicion and chaos has been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and Asia Pacific.
The report in February (when most cases of infection were confirmed from China) showed that there was a discrimination of racial discrimination to various Chinese groups of people around the world that they deserve this disease or get what is considered to be contagious of what they have committed.
Some countries in Africa have also been seen with a dissent of Chinese people.
Many people in Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origins.
There is support for Chinese people both online and offline, and to those in the banned region with the virus.
With the process of the outbreak to recent countries, people from Italy, the first European country to experience severe COVID-19 infections, have been dropped into suspicions and foreign hatred. Some of the citizens in Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea have initiated a strict registration to ban Chinese into their country to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, signs of phrases #Chinese banned into Japan tend to be high on Twitter.
Chinese people as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported increasing levels of racism and violations.
US President Donald Trump has been criticized for saying that coronavirus is a "Chinese virus" which is thought to be racism and anti-China.
Urban protesters in Ukraine make attacks on buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuating from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from the northeast of India with bordered China and students studying in the major cities of India have been reported to have suffered persecution regarding the outbreak of the virus.
Bharatiya Janata’s head of state unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh said the Chinese people destroyed nature and “this is why God has avenged them.”
The note was later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "missious". In China, foreign fears and racism on non-Chinese were affected by the pandemic that foreigners were said to be "foreign waste" and defined as "residential waste".
Many newspapers paid to access have deleted this condition for some broadcasts or all broadcasts related to coronavirus.
Many scientific publications have conducted scientific research related to the disease for use.
Some scientists have quickly shared their results on preprint dynamics such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for new type of respiratory inflammatory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include the detection method of the virus’s presence and those who find the antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by the reverse polymer replication line reaction (RT-PCR), which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only RNA of SARS-CoV-2.
It is used to confirm recent infections or activities.
Surveillance of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and population reviews.
The antibodies test shows the number of people with this disease, including those who do not issue symptoms and who have little symptoms to report as well.
Accuracy of mortality rates due to the disease and levels of immunity of the human group can be determined through the results of the test.
Due to limited testing by March 2020, no country has reliable data on the rate of viruses in their population.
As of 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of their population, and there is a great difference in the number of tests that have been done across the country.
This sensitivity is also likely to significantly affect mortality rates in reported cases, which are likely to exceed estimates in some countries.
By using the polymer chain reaction of replication in real-time (rRT-PCR), the test can be done on respiratory samples obtained in different ways, including fiberglass samples, diaphragm, throat or heating, etc.
The results are generally obtained within hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests performed with throat swelling are only reliable in the first week of the disease.
The virus can then disappear in the throat while it continues to grow to the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternative samples can be taken from deep respiratory tracts by suction caffeine tubes or equipment for coughs (storms) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was established in Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using a polymerase chain reaction reversed real-time (rRT-PCR), and established 250.000 foundations for distribution by the WHO (WHO).
The UK also developed a test by 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR treatment class based on the SARS-CoV-2 device (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
"This approach explores gene ""E"" which is distributed by all coronaviruses and RdRp genes specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group is the first company to receive immediate use of SARS-CoV-2 based on the PCR reaction of China's National Medical Products Administration (China's National Medical Products Administration). In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing the replicable polymerase cable reaction diagnostic panel of its new type coronavirus in 2019 (2019-nCoV) to the public health laboratory via substance for international testing."
One of the three genetic testing devices in the old generation of the test makes the results uncertain because of errors and obstacles of testing at the CDC in Atlanta, this is an average result of less than 100 samples per day that have been successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Test using two compounds is not determined to be reliable until February 28, 2020, and it is not until the state and local laboratory is allowed to start testing.
This test was approved by the Food and Pharmaceutical Administration under the authentic trading laboratories in the emergency period. The trading laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide COVID-19 test offer based on RT-PCR.
Diagnosis of the search process was established across the country, COVID-19 trials are offered on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced, the collection of samples and processing must comply with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, COVID-19 testing was developed and produced by the state-class VECTOR Biological Survey Center.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by federal services for health surveillance. On 12 March 2020, Mayo clinics were reported to have developed a test to look for COVID-19 infections. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received approval from FDA for testing that can be carried out within 3.5 hours in high quantities, so allowing a machine to test approximately 4.128 within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted immediate access (EUA) to Abbott Laboratory for testing on Abbott’s m2000 system. Over the past, the Food and Drug Administration has provided similar access to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Science.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received the EUA from FDA by testing that took about 45 minutes.
FDA passed a test using nucleic acid expansion technology instead of PCR technology.
Because it does not require a cycle of smooth temperature, this method can provide positive results within five minutes and negative results within 13 minutes.
There are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States, and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50000 tests per day. Tests that use a cluster of cyclone-linked microorganisms to proteins (protein N) of new types of coronavirus occurring in Taiwan with the hope that it can deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes, such as rapid flu test
"The March 2020 literature review concluded that "the ultraviolet rays of the chest are less valuable to diagnose at the first stage, whereas the CT's findings [a place recording of the organism] can be present even before symptoms." ""
General features on CT include dual-sided multiparty glass humidity with dispersion behind the incompatible appearance and equipment.
Overall numbers under the pneumonia membrane, pattern of osteoporosis and combination are developed while the disease evolves.
A study of comparison between the polymerasic line reaction (PCR) to CT (CT) in Wuhan, the origin of current pandemic, has shown that the city is more sensitive than PCR, with many features of its images overlaping with pneumonia and other disease processes, although not specific.
"In March 2020, the U.S. College of Science recommends" "CT should not be used to screen or as the first line test to diagnose COVID-19." In March 2020, CDC introduced PCR for tracking startups."
Part of the immune response to the infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These tasks are available to cause individual infections, start from 7 days or after the start of symptoms to identify immunity and in population surveillance. Tests may be carried out at the Laboratory Center (CLT) or by taking care of testing (PoCT).
The high-performance automation system in many pathological treatment laboratorys will be able to carry out these analysis, but the ability to use this system will depend on the production rate for each system.
For a single sample that replaces the CLT blood pump is often used, although the subsequent sample can be used to monitor immune system reactions.
For a single blood sample PoCT is usually received by acute.
Unlike the PCR method, the download step is not necessary before typing. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 units that provide notice to the agency as required, and can now distribute their operations test.
On 7 April 2020, only solo tests were approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, the diagnosis in the Euroimmun Medical Laboratory and Epitope’s diagnosis received European approval for their test suite that could protect IgG and IgA antiviruses in the blood samples.
The test capacity is hundreds of samples within a few hours, and so is faster than the PCR confirmation of RNA viruses.
Usually, the antibodies can be found within 14 days after the beginning of the infection. In early April, the UK found that among the suite of antibodies they purchased, there was no suite that had been qualified for use.
“HongKong has prepared a project that suspected patients can stay home,” said the emergency department will provide sample tubes to patients,” they disinfected and sent that age back, and a while later they will get a test. The UK National Health Service (British NHS) announced that they were testing the project to test the case suspected of having a home disease that could reduce the risk of patients transmission to others if they came to hospital or if there was an emergency vehicle that had a virus killing if used. In a car testing Covid-19 for suspected cases, the healthcare professional takes the samples with the most caution.”
The Driving Center helped South Korea make the fastest and most comprehensive test of any country. In Germany, the National Health Insurance Medical Doctors said on 2 March that it had the ability to test about 12,000 people per day in emergency cars and 10,700 were tested in the past week.
The cost is guaranteed by health insurance when the test is ordered by the doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity for testing 160,000 per week.
As of March 19th, the test was offered in some major cities.
On March 26, 2020, it was unknown that the total number of tests in Germany because only positive results were reported.
The first laboratory survey showed that as of a week 12/2020, at least 483.295 samples were tested and included weeks 12/2020 and 33.491 (6.9%) samples were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, the researchers at the Israeli Institute of Technology (Technion) and Rambam Hospital (Rambam) developed and tested a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously by conducting sample collections and further testing only in cases that found that the samples collected were positive. In Wuhan, the laboratory of emergency browsing (Rambam) was launched in the 2000 square meters, named "Hu-Month" (Chinese), or "Gi-Mech" was launched in 5th day.
By construction, there is control by BGI founder Wang Jian, and it takes 5 days to create models that show cases in Hubei, do not be higher than 47%, but the costs involved in solving problems, put aside, do not be double, and if the test capacity is not used.
Wuhan Laboratory is immediately monitored by Hui-yuan Laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai in 12 cities across China.
On 4 March 2020, the total number of tests was 50,000 times a day. The source of diverse designs by Origami Assays was released, which tested 1,122 patients, who found COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be processed in a small laboratory without the use of automated liquid capacitors.
In March, the lack and insufficient amount of conversion became a barrier to mass testing in the EU and the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led to some authors looking for sample preparation protocols related to heat samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the UAE was further testing its people for coronaviruses in one head than other countries and was on the way to expand the level of testing to reach most people.
"This is through a combination of the ability to drive and purchase a large laboratory from the population from 42 groups and BGI (based on their "Hu-driven" laboratory in China)."
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has tens of RT-PCR tests capacity per day, and is the first in the world to operate overseas China.
Various testing formulas that focus on various parts of the enemy genome form established in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for manufacturing equipment sent to low-income countries without resources to develop themselves.
The German recipe was published on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the U.S. Center for Disease Management was not until 28 January, delaying the test available in the United States and the United States had problems with the reliability of the testing equipment at the early stages of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were not able to supply enough equipment to meet the needs and recommendations for testing by health professionals.
On the contrary, experts say that the extensive South Korean test reduces the spread of the new coronavirus.
Test capacity, which is mostly in the laboratory of the private sector, was established for many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs, the best way to reduce the pre-COVID-19 pandemic spread. High demand for testing due to the spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of tests at the private laboratory in the United States and supply of equipment for double washing and substances for chemical testing became stressful.
In March 2020, China reported issues related to accuracy in their testing equipment.
"In the United States the trial suite was established by CDC, there is ""disputable"". Then the government blocked the diplomatic office that blocked private tests. Spain bought the trial suite from China Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were incorrect."
The company explained that incorrect results may be caused by a lack of sample collection or using the device correctly.
The Ministry of Spain said it will remove tools that provide incorrect results and will replace them with other testing tools provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80 percent of the trial equipment in the Czech Republic purchased from China provided wrong results. Slovakia bought 1,2 million test equipment from China, which was found to be incorrect.
"President Matovič has requested to be thrown into the Danube River. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kit Turkey bought from China had ""high error rate""" and ""not put to use"". The UK bought 3.5 million test kit from China, but in early April 2020 announced that these devices were not available."
The follow-up test with those who have tested positive and monitored those with a positive relationship SARS-CoV-2 is in contact with as a result of positive results.
Researchers work in the Italian city of Vò, where the first death of COVID-19 in Italy, have tested two rounds on the entire population of about 3400 people apart about ten days.
Approximately half of people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases found were kept separately.
With the trip to the detention level, this can completely eliminate new infections.
With strong communication monitoring, domestic travel restrictions, testing and quarantining in 2020, global collapse of coronavirus in Singapore is slower than other developed countries, but no significant restrictions such as forced closing restaurants and retail foundations.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has begun to advise residents to stay home on 28 March, but the school has reopened on time after a break on 23 March.
More countries have also managed the pandemic through intense contact, domestic travel restrictions, testing, and quarantination, but with homes that are less dull, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A study based on figures found that many countries tested in terms of mortality had much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries could prevent milder symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries with no capacity to test and national labs with limited COVID-19 experience need to send five positive COVID-19 samples and their first ten negative samples to one of the 16 World Health Organization’s laboratorys for certification tests.
Among the 16 reference laboratories, 7 in Asia 5 in Europe 2 in Africa 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
"In the chart below the column "" positive percent of the test"" is influenced by the country's testing policy."
A country that tests only people who enter a hospital will be highly positive as % of tests over a country that tests all citizens whether they show symptoms, and anything else is the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the activity of washing one’s hands in order to judge soil, fat, microbes, or other substances that we do not need.
Washing hands with persistent soaps in some "important moments" when the day protects the spread of many diseases, for example, pandemics and oral infections.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or common flu, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their nose or mouth (e.g. lubrication membrane).
Five important situations every day to wash hands with soap include pre-and post-paying tablets, after cleaning children, or also changing children's puppets before feeding children before snacking and before or after preparing meals, or also cooking fish and birds.
The World Health Organization recommends washing hands: We can wash hands with ashes if there is no water and soap.
Before the period and after the preparation of the food.
Before and after care, you are sick.
After changing the calendering fabric, or cleaning the children who have already used the toilet.
After wipe your nose, cough or socks.
After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.
Professional hand hygiene focuses on the practice of hand hygiene related to the curriculum procedure.
Hand washing before taking medications or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands, an infected agent (viral bacteria or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
It is especially important for those who manage food or work in the medical field, but also an important practice for general public messages.
Hand washing has many benefits to health, including reducing the spread of coronavirus and other infections. Preventing the cause of infection, reducing respiratory infections.
and reduce baby mortality rates when giving birth at home.
A 2013 study showed that hand washing practices can be slightly improved to the growth of children under five years old.
In developing countries, children’s mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and respiratory diseases can be reduced by the introduction of simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soaps, etc.
This simple action can reduce mortality rates due to these diseases by nearly 50%.
Interactions that promote hand washing can reduce disease by about a third, and this can be compared to low-income water supply in low-income areas.
48% of diarrhea reductions can be associated with hand washing with soaps. Hand washing with soap is one of the most effective and cheap means of preventing coronavirus and acute respiratory infections (ARI), an automated behavior in schools and communities homes around the world.
The main cause of lung inflammation, the main ARI, is the first cause of death among children under five years of age, killing about 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together have nearly 3.5 million children mortality rates per year.
According to UNESCO, washing hands with soap before eating and after using toilets into a habit that can save life more than vaccine or any medical intervention by reducing death from pandemics, nearly half and deaths that drop from acute respiratory tract infection.
Hand washing is usually combined with other hygiene interventions, as part of the water program, hygiene and hygiene.
Hand cleaning can also protect against skin inflammation, which goes through direct contact.
A small bad effect of hand washing is that hand washing can often cause skin damage due to drying skin.
The 2012 Danish study found that too many handwashings could cause a measuring of skin, known as a bracelet or hand-to-patitis, commonly occurring among healthcare workers.
Too often hand washing is also seen as a symptom of multiple thought diseases.
Six important times a day you need to wash your hands with soap are to reduce contact with stools and mouths: after using a bathroom (small folding and large folding) after washing your partner (changing kidneys) before feeding food to the child after eating and before or after preparing food or cooking, or holding fish or birds.
Other opportunities when having proper hand washing techniques should be applied to prevent infection replication, including before and after treating the wound or breastfeeding. After your cough or bleaching after touching animal waste or animal damage, and after affecting the trash.
In many countries, hand washing rates with soap are still low.
A study of hand cleaning done in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average home population 38.7% applied hand washing with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97% of the United States, 77% and China had the lowest rate of 23%. The methods in changing some behavior are now to increase hand washing with soap at the time of batching. The daily timed cleaning team for students is an option to develop the country by helping young people to have a positive attitude in hand cleaning.
“Demand healthcare program”, which is carried out by the Department of Education in Philippines, is an example of curriculum activity to promote children’s health and education.
A one-year double-back insect drop added by washing hands daily with teeth soaps daily with flute is the main point of the national program.
It is also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Detoxification from the skin is clear by adding soap or soap to the water.
The main activity of soaps and antiviruses is to reduce soluble masks and increase solubility.
The single-faced water is not an effective skin cleaning agent because fat and proteins, which are compounds of soil organics, are not easy to dissolve in water.
However, strong flow of water can help clean up.
As a result, the solid soap that we can use the renewable vegetables contain bacteria that are attached to and the soap after being used.
A small number of studies examined the transmission of bacteria from contaminated soaps concluded that the transfer seemed unable to replicate bacteria because it was already cleaned with soap bubbles.
“CDC still says, “The liquid soap water in a bottle with a press head is it’s better.”
It has been widely advertised from antibodies and bacteria to public health.
So far, there is no evidence that any use of antibiotics or bacteria is recommended for antibiotics that are resistant in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains a common antibacterial agent such as Trichlosan, which has the most pressure-resistant quantities of the organism.
Thus, if they have not chosen a number of bacteria that are immune to antibiotics, antibacterial soaps will not be as effective as they have been advertised.
In addition to pneumonia bags, preventing acute shortage and fake skin protection agents, this also contains acidic acid, as well as acidic, acid, acid, acid, acid, acid, acid, acid, acid, pharmaceutical, regulator PH. Virus killers and skin-protected creams (such as ultravitamin, tablet, and natural substances). An analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health states that normal soaps are as effective as soaps that contain trillosan in the prevention of diseases and bacteria on their hands.
The warm water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacterial growth is extremely fast at body temperature (37°C).
However, hot water, soap juices are more effective than cold water and soap water in natural oil clearance, which hold soil and bacteria.
Scientific study, in contrast to the popular faith, showed that the use of hot water does not work on reducing the microfiber available on the hands.
Alcohol, hand-washing, or hand-to-hand antivirus, is a non-water hand hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the hand-free hand cleaning agent was alcohol (known as alcohol, hand washing, hand washing, hand washing, hand washing, hand washing, hand cleaning) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on ultra-polyethylene alcohol or ethanol forming together with thick agents such as carbonum (polyamide acid) into gels or other substances such as glycerin into liquids or fums to ease use and reduce the drying efficiency of alcohol.
Adding hydrogen-peroxide chemical compounds makes up the activity of antivirus. The hand washing water loaded at least 60 to 95% is sufficient to kill the virus
Alcohol, antibiotics, antibiotics, antibiotics, antibiotics, antibiotics (MRSA and VRE), TB and several viruses (including HIV, RSV, flu vaccine, and hepatitis).
Alcohol Washing with 70% alcohol-adjusted 99.97% reductions 3.5 similar to 35 desiccation) of bacteria on hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (reducing 4 to 5 liters) of bacteria on hand 1 minute after use. The hand washing alcohol is most effective against bacteria and is less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol, hand washing, antivirus, is almost ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk), which is the most common cause of gastrointestinal inflammation. Washing enough hands or alcohol wipes must be used to wet or cover both hands.
The bottom of the back of the hands, both and between the finger ends, are wiped about 30 seconds until the liquid, bubble or dry gel.
The finger end must also be washed by brushing them with both hands. The American Center for Anti-infectious Disease recommends washing hands with alcohol, hand washing, antivirus, especially when the hand looks dirty.
The increasing use of these agencies is based on the convenience of use and rapid killing activities against microorganisms. But they should not replace proper hand washing unless there is no soap and water.
Using hand washing gels, antiviruses can often cause dry skin unless skin and/or skin moisturizing is added into the formula.
Drying efficiency of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding ceramic oil and/or other skin fleas into the formula.
In medical experiments, hand washing gels containing skin faucets have caused less skin and dry skin inflammation than soaps or soaps to kill microfibers.
Skin inflammation by something that has an Alcohol reaction, exposure: acute disease, acute glucose, or alcohol exposure, or additives that are in hand washing gels are rarely occurring.
Lesser practices can cause skin inflammation caused by inflammation reactions have become an attraction compared to hand washing with soap and water.
In addition to its efficiency, non-water agents cannot wash hands with those organic organisms, but can kill the organic organs simply.
Because of this, hand washing water is not as effective as soaps and water in preventing the spread of many inorganic organisms that can cause the disease because the pathogens remain on their hands.
The ability of alcoholless hand washing water is strongly dependent on ingredients and mortars, and historically, alcohol and gel washing hands are ineffective.
Recently, the formula that uses benzalkonium chloride has been shown to have continuous antivirus activity and rises in order after use, which is unlike alcohol, which is shown to have decreased efficiency after repeated use, perhaps due to increased skin reactions in order.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ashes or soil instead.
Washing with ashes or soil can be more effective than washing using a single face of water, but it is not as effective as washing using soap.
One concern is that if soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, it can increase the spread of disease more than reducing it.
Ash is also a soap-like antivirus agent because when touching with water it forms an alkaline coal solution.
The World Health Organization recommends using ashes or sand as alternative when there is no soap.
The right hand washing technique is recommended by the United States Anti-Refrigeration Center for Disease Prevention infectious diseases with the following stages:
Hand moisturizing with hot water or cooling water flowing.
It is recommended to use water flow because the water reservoir can be contaminated while the temperature in the water does not seem to vary.
Paint soap bubbles on their hands by brushing them with multiple soaps, including the back between fingers and nails.
Soaps are able to eliminate skin viruses and studies have shown that many people tend to wash hands thoroughly when washing with soap rather than washing water.
Toothpaste at least 20 seconds.
Toothpaste creates a friction that helps eliminate the virus from the skin, and long-term washing will help eliminate the virus more.
Wash well under the water that is flowing down.
A clearing in the pool (water will or will not flow) can reload your hands.
Take a clean towel, wipe your hands dry or let it dry by air.
Moisturising hands and chilling hands are more susceptible to re-infecting messages. The missing places are generally the thumb, the finger, the area between fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and nails can be sheltered for microorganisms.
Moisturizers are often recommended to keep hands from drying. Dry skin can lead to skin damage, which can increase the risk of infection.
Many low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing in places without water, machines, and/or soap, for example, pouring water from water tanks or hollows that are suitable and/or using ashes if necessary in developing countries. In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries) there are water conservation solutions such as "tippy-taps" and other low-cost options.
Fitting suspension tank is a simple technology using a rope suspended water tank, and you take a floor leg to pour a little water on your hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand cleaning process, but there are some debate about the most effective drying form in the public bathroom.
The growing amount of research has shown that sanitary paper has more hygiene than hand dryers available in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study led by Westminster University, London and co-operated by European Tissue Paper Sanitary Industry Symposium to compare hygiene levels from hand dryer and other modern hand dryer.
After washing and hand dryer using a total number of bacterial dryers have been found to have increased on the fingerpad, which averages 194% and on the bottom of the hands 254%.
Dryer with dryer causes an average increase in the total amount of bacteria on the 42% fingerpad and on the bottom of the arm 15%.
After washing and drying hands, the total amount of bacteria is reduced on average on the fingerpad up to 76% and on the bottom of the hand up to 77%. Scientists have also tested to determine whether the potential of contamination of other bathroom users and the bathroom environment, as a result of each drying method.
Air ventilation dryer out of the machine at 180 m/s (650 km per hour, 400 m/h) has the ability to evacuate microorganisms from hands and dryers, and can cause dirt to other bathroom users and the environment around a 2 m away bathroom.
Using dryer can spread microorganisms (small organisms) up to 0.25 meters from dryer.
The sanitary paper did not reveal the microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwel assessed some different hand drying psychology.
Observation of the changes in the number of bacteria after the dry hand has been found as follows:
There are different dryers manufacturers who have come up and hand dryers are compared to dryers with sanitary paper.
The use of hand washing gels for hand washing is an option during our journey without soap and enough water.
Alcohol hand washing water should be at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became a necessity after Hungarian national physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of infectious diseases in the surroundings of hospitals.
There are electronic devices that provide information to remind hospital staff to wash hands when they forget to do it.
A study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
Medical hand washing is at least 15 seconds using soap and water or gel in suitable quantities to paint and plant each part of the hand.
Should be brushed by one another.
You should use the chassis to remove the chassis under the nails if it is available.
It is important to wash your hands well and dry it with a clean towel because the virus can remain left in the water that is on the hands.
After washing hands, you should use the toilet paper to close the water (and open any gate if necessary).
This avoids recontamination from the hands with those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in healthcare is to eliminate infections and avoid replicating them.
The new British Medical Journal reports that hand washing is still in the unacceptable level in most medical departments, with most doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients that lead to transmission of microorganisms.
A study found that hand washing and other easy procedures could reduce the rate of blood flow transmission involving a 66 percent blood pump. The World Health Organization advertised the instructions paper showing hand washing and hand brushing in the healthcare sector.
The drafting of the hand hygiene guidelines by the organization is also available at its website to request public opinion.
A relevance point review was made by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and activate hand hygiene if expressing the need to apply to general rules.
The World Health Organization has "five hours" for hand washing:
After blood contact or fluid from the body
before doing the Virus Cleaning task and
After the care of the patient. Adding a chemical that kills the virus into a soap (“the drug” or “the antivirus”) can cause an antivirus reaction in the hand washing agent.
Such antivirus action may be wanted to be done before undergoing surgery or in the place where bacteria are highly resistant to antibiotics. Therefore, washing your hands when surgery is needed to have a rosin, open and closed water without touching it using a hand washing water, chlorhexidine or iodine clean towel for hand drying, after washing, brushed for brushing and non-viral equipment for cleaning under the nails.
All jewelry should be removed.
This form requires hand washing and arming up to the elbow, usually for 2-6 minutes.
Long brushes (10 minutes) are not necessary.
He must prevent the water from flowing back to his hands when washing it.
Take a clean fabric, dry your hands after washing your hands, and wear your sleeves ready.
To reduce the spread of the virus, it is better to wash your hands or use a hand-to-hand antibiotic before and after patient care.
For the management of staphylococcal infections in the hospital, it has been found that the biggest benefits from hand washing are from first 20 percent cleaning, and very little extra benefits received from hand cleaning are often increased by more than 35%.
Hand washing with conventional soaps still has more than three-time bacterial infections from food compared to hand washing with antibacterial soaps. A comparison between hand washing with alcohol and hand washing with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds has shown that hand washing with acne can reduce the infection by 26% more than acneicide soap.
But soap and water are more effective than gel, hand washing, antivirus for reducing H1N1 influenza, virus, and pandemic by rubbering, clostridium, which comes out of hand. The meeting to improve hand hygiene in healthcare facilities can involve education to staff from hand washing, improving hands with alcohol and written and oral reminders to employees.
It has a need for further research whether any of the most effective interventions in different healthcare facilities.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as cost-effective, which is an important tool for getting good health and getting good nutrition.
But lack of water supply, soap or reliable hand washing facilities at the home of the people of the school and at work makes it difficult to achieve global hand washing behavior.
For example, hand washing facilities in most isolated areas in Africa near private places and public bathrooms are less expensive, although there are options to build hand washing facilities.
However, this lower hand washing rate may be a cause of not habitat in hand washing more than a lack of water or soap.
Promoting and advocating of hand washing with soap can influence decisions on policies, increase understanding of hand washing benefits and lead to long-term behavioral changes.
For this work to be effective, control and assessment is essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-effective approaches in increasing hand washing at LMICs while social marketing campaigns are ineffective. One example of promoting hand washing in school is “three important ways” by UNICEF, which promotes schools to carry out easy and low-cost steps to ensure that students have washed hands with soap among other sanitary conditions.
When the minimum standard is completed, the school can change from one star level to the three highest stars.
Building a lot of hand washing facilities is part of the promotion of hand washing, providing reduced infections and reducing children's death.
Global Handshake Day is another example of the campaign that promotes understanding that is trying to achieve behavioral changes. As a result of the spread of coronavirus 2019-20, UNICEF has promoted the adoption of the emoticons of hand washing.
A small number of studies have considered the total cost of hand washing in developing countries that are associated with DALYs.
But a review shows that promoting hand washing with soap is actually less cost than hygiene and other water interventions.
The importance of hand washing is for human health and especially for those who are in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have just relaxed children or wounded soldiers in hospitals, first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene pioneers, Hungarian physicians, Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, English "founder of modern nursing".
At the time, most people still believe that infections occur due to a bad smell called miasmas.
In the 1980s, the outbreak of food infections and healthcare-related infections led the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more active hand hygiene, an important way to prevent spreads.
After the influenza outbreak in 2009 and the global pandemic of COVID-19 in 2020, some countries realized that hand washing with soap was important to protect themselves from infections.
For example, the wallpaper with the word “hand washing techniques properly” has been suspended next to the hand washing spot in public toilets and in the toilet of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase “washing hands to get rid of something” means that the post doesn’t want to be responsible for one thing or share of complexity in the thing.
It is derived from the Bible text in Matthew, where Paul from Lazarus washed his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but became a phrase with a wider use in some English communities.
The figure in the slogan begins to force her hand to wash by attempting to clean up the stains of imagination that represent understanding her fault in connection with the crimes she has done and drive her husband to commit.
It was found that people after memory or reminiscent of unethical actions, they were more likely to think of washing hands often than others, and the face also valued hand washing equipment.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such admiration are unlikely to participate in “cleaning of purity” or activities of other repairs like volunteers.
Some religions claim that hand washing is for keeping hygiene and symbolises in other purposes. The symbol of hand washing using only water does not use soap is one of the special conditions of hand washing in some religions, including Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah, and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wodhu in Islam. These religions have also confirmed that hand washing is especially after any specific action.
Hinduism, Jews and Islam requires washing hands after using the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Buddhism, Buddhism, Islam, and Islam require washing hands before and after eating.
Workplace Dangerous Management for COVID-19 Risk
Dangerous management at work for COVID-19 is the practice of work safety and health approaches for dangerous management to the prevention of coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19).
Local hazard control depends on workplace and work based on the risk assessment of the source of the disease’s severe challenges in the community and the risk factors of individual employees that may be susceptible to COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Labor and Health Safety Administration (OSHA). Low-risk jobs have little work relationship with the public and other colleagues who are advised to use basic infection prevention measures, including hand cleaning, encourage workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory, and maintain normal cleaning and killing of the working environment.
Medium-risk jobs include those who need frequent or close contact with unknown people or suspected of COVID-19, but may be infected due to ongoing community infections or international travel.
This includes employees who are in contact with the general public, such as at the school of environmental, work-density, people and some high-level retail facilities.
Dangerous management for this group in addition to basic infection protection measures, including ventilation using high efficiency air filters, cough masks, and have personal protective equipment available in case of encounter with those with COVID-19.
OSHA considers healthcare staff and informational sites known or suspected that COVID-19 is at high risk by a direct touch that increases the risk of high risk if employees carry out the procedure for forming aerosol or collecting or addressing samples from people who are known or suspected of having COVID-19.
Dangerous management for these employees includes engineering management, such as negative pressured air room and personal protection equipment that fits the job.
COVID-19 outbreaks may affect some workplaces.
Employees may be absent from work because they are sick, need to take care of others or from the fear of possible exposure.
Commercial patterns can change either in terms of what goods are required and the means of getting these goods (such as shopping at the highest hour or through transportation or driving service).
Finally, the shipping of goods from a geographic area that has been severely affected by Covid-19 has been suspended. The response plan and preparation to infection may be used to introduce various protection activities.
The plan to address risk levels related to work and work tasks, including the source of exposure to risk factors that arise from home and community installation and risk factors of individual employees such as old age or chronic health conditions.
They also highlight the management necessary to address those risks and plan that the status for the situation may occur as a result of the outbreak.
Preparation and response to infectious diseases can be subject to national or national recommendations.
The aim for responding to the outbreak includes reducing transmission among high-risk human protection staffs for ill health consequences, maintaining business transactions and reducing negative effects to other organizations in their supply chains.
A severe situation in the community is because local businesses affected are responding.
Dangerous order management is a framework that is widely used in work safety and health for effective group risk management.
When COVID-19 hazards cannot be eliminated, the most effective management is engineering management, then the administration and final personal protection equipment.
Engineering management includes dispersing employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior and can be the highest cost-effective solution to practice.
Administration Management is a policy change or work procedures that require activities from employees or employers.
Personal protection equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering and administration management, but can help protect some challenges.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the dangers of workers who are properly equipped with the applicable (e.g., respiratory equipment), consistent and accurate, continuously monitor, maintain and renovate, and are properly removed, clean, and save or disposable to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Health and Career Safety Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have little work relationship with the public and other colleagues.
The measures to prevent infections that are recommended for the workplace include frequent and thorough washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, respiratory behavior, including cough and lavage, provide paper, wipes, and toothpaste, preparation for telecommunications or turn switches, if necessary not to encourage employees from using devices and other devices, and maintain normal cleaning and killing of the working environment.
Individual identification, infection and quarantination, is an important step in protecting employees, customers, guests and others at work.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requires employees with symptoms of severe respiratory disease to rest at home until they are no longer having fever, fever, and any other symptoms at least 24 hours without the use of other heating or drug-changing symptoms, and the policy of rest due to the disease is flexible, allowing employees to stay home to care for sick family members, and that employees must understand those principles.
According to the OSHA, work faced with an average risk, including those who need frequent or close communications in six feet (1.8 m) of unknown people or suspected that patients with COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because community infections are continuing around the business location or because that person has recent international travel to a location with the spread of COVID-19.
These include employees who are connected with the general public, such as at school, high density work environments, and some advanced retail settings. Engineering management for this group and high risk groups, including high-effective air filter installation, increases the air-conservation rate, such as plastic, moisture and driving window for customer service. Administration management for this group and high-risk groups, including encouraging workers who are sick to stay home. Instead of meeting directly with virtual relationships, create great changes, stop the unnecessarily to the location where there is a spread of COVID-19 communication plans, including the staff’s response platform, providing employees with direct education and training, creating the latest changes on the risk of eyeclubs, and protecting customer’s eyebrows and eyebrows, and minimizing workbands, providing employees how to protect their employees, and manipulating how to protect their employees, including eyebrows, eyebrows, eyebrows, and eyebrows, and minimizing, and eyebrows, workbrows, to protect their employees, and workbands, to protect their employees, and workbrows, and workbrows, and workbrows, with a wide-re, to a wide-re, to protect their employees, and workblats, to protect, and work, to a wide, to protect, and protect their employees, and work, to a wide, to a wide, to a wide, to a wide, protect, and work with a wide, protect, and protect, and protect, and work with a wide-toes.
Employees in this risk group are rare to use respiratory equipment.
If a person falls sick on a plane, checks properly to protect employees and other passengers, including dispersing sick people from others, 6 feet away, appointing a crew member to serve the patient, and giving a mask to the sick, or asking the sick to pack their mouths and noses when coughing or coughing.
Aviation team should wear medical gloves that can be thrown after use when caring for passengers with disease or touching fluids on the body and may have additional personal protective equipment if the passenger has a fever, cough, unstoppable or difficult to breathe.
Gloves and other disposable items should be dumped in biofuel bags, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and killed. For commercial transportation, including tourist vessels and other passenger vessels, dangerous management includes delays during the sick and isolates themselves and informs the medical center on an urgent plane if anyone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical monitoring should occur in the human room. For schools and CDC childcare facilities, recommend short-term closures to clean or kill the virus if someone infected in the school building regardless of the spread in the community.
When there is a minimal community transmission to the average, the strategy of social gaps can be applied, such as abolition of travel to the field, assemblies, and other large gatherings, such as physical education or group, or food at the cafe, increases the gap between the table, arrival, and a staggering evacuation, limiting the number of non-necessary tourists, and using a separate health office location for children with symptoms like flu.
When there is a lot of transportation in the local community, in addition to socially redirected strategies, extended school appeals can be considered. For employees who practice laws that perform daily activities immediately are considered low-risk health by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers must contact individuals who are certified or suspected of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same instructions as emergency medical technicians, including proper personal protection equipment.
If the contact is disconnected during the concern, the staff should clean and relax the virus to the belt and their medical suite before reusable using peppers or cleanups and follow the standard execution procedures of the storage and disposable medical suite used as well as clothing storage and laundry.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and some vaccines with high risks of exposure risks.
High-risk jobs include healthcare services, laboratory support and medical transportation personnel known as suspected patients with COVID-19.
These have become a highly challenging risk if employees perform aerospace-assisted or collected procedure or sampled from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Procedures to create solid or liquid quality separation into gas including hose pension, coughing procedure, drying procedures and some teeth reviews or pandemic sample collections.
A high-risk job, including workers involved in organisations of people who know or suspected COVID-19 cases when they die. These are at high risks if they are infrastructure. Additional engineering management for these risk groups, including separate placement rooms for known patients, or suspected of COVID-19, includes when the equipment forming procedure that liquids can shoot as small parts that are carried out.
A negative air pressure specialized may be appropriate in some healthcare and cloud-based facilities.
Samples should be precautured carefully by 3 level biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients come to be separated into different waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case. In addition, the other PPE OSHA recommends using respiratory equipment for those working at 6 feet of known patients or suspected SARS-CoV-2 and those who carry out aerospace-forming procedure.
In the United States, the wearing face gloves help to breathe in the face of N95 NIOSH approved or better used in a comprehensive context of the written breathing protection program, including the appropriate trial, training and medical exams.
Other types of respiratory appliances can provide greater protection and improve employee comfort. WHO does not recommend the wear of the gloves that COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than replicating through the liquid.
The World Health Organization has introduced surgical masks for only employees who control entry places.
For those who are collecting respiratory samples, you are taking care of or transporters of COVID-19 patients without the procedure to create a separation of solid or liquidអង្គធាតុ into gas, WHO recommends using medical masks, eye protection glasses, or face masks, gloves and gloves.
Procedures that create solid or liquid quality separation into gas are applied to a medical mass replaced by N95 or FFP2.
Because the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telemedicine physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in maintenance directly into the room with COVID-19 patients only use the PPE necessary for specific work, continuing to use the respiratory device without removing it when the care of many patients with the same diagnosis, monitor and facilitate the supply chain of PPE, and encourage the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

In this month, we know that we are in a very interesting situation.
COVID-19 pandemic is something that clearly demonstrates the relationship between our people and our world and the responsibility we have to each other.
We do not have a sample for its challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the type of global understanding, cooperation, and community building, the heart of the organization.
Photography and attention we have seen among all of our colleagues via email, calls and chats are remarkable validations of incredible people we are lucky enough to work with.
I'm really nothing more grateful and proud of having everyone co-operative.
Last week, they told me they were grateful for our work.
They heard me what it means to the world that can turn to Wikipedia now and what is a powerful symbol for this important resource to be online and available for all people.
Your job makes this possible, whether you keep this website in the same way or our colleagues paid or our community safe.
The world needs information that Wikipedia provides now more than ever.
This is the time not only what we do, but how we do it will influence the world.
Because this mission is important and your role, we will make some adjustments in the way we work together starting this coming week.
Our work and schedule adaptation
As Robyn mentioned in advance, the C team met overnight to discuss our methods and schedules for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we think is the right response to what we are facing and the best way to make the organization sustainable during this period.
Overall, we want to eliminate stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to call back, that's okay.
For employees, contractors and contractors:
Our daily job expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until additional notice.
We do not post holidays – if you can work beyond normal hours, this active candidate may need you.
However, the world cannot predict now, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, buyers, or go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We do not track your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should go without talking, but we are talking.
No sick days or PTO required – just tell your administrator and help your team modify calendars and schedules to make sure the main parts of the work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan in T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can provide assistance and make sure your situation gets proper attention from the management class).
Many hours will be fully paid.
We have already spoken, and we are committed again to comply with our commitment to our contractors and colleagues every hour.
Everyone will get paid on the basis of their normal working hours in normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and cannot work.
If you work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means of transmission of their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be an incredible reward, especially during this period.
Again, this is your own care.
We ask you to contact your administrator to let us know what is expected and can be adjusted accordingly.
One job is considered necessary.
There are some things we have to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Safety, and Corporate (out of other teams) do important work that may need additional help.
We will start working with all departments to evaluate current purposes and divert our attention to support what is necessary for our mission.
There are many things to do for us all, we just focus on the most essential projects.
Speed reduction will now not be painful later.
We do not have a "double tracking" plan when the pandemic has passed.
You will not be expected to work additional hours to meet the deadline that is now not practical.
We accept changing circumstances and will make a more suitable new timeline and targeting.
What happens involving the program (annual plan)?
In order to adjust to new budgets and daily working hours expectations, we aim to adjust the time for our 2020-2021 annual planning.
Our aim is to extend our 2019-2020 plan, allowing more time to prepare budgets to allow employees to prioritize important jobs, maintain themselves and care for loved ones while taking those who need or intend to reduce the schedule within a few weeks ahead.
This timing delay reduces a lot of current planning workload and pressure across the entire unit.
We will recommend our request to the board next week and will update delegates and teams at the next step when we have confirmation.
Thank you for the APP team for your leadership in this mission.
Terms and Conditions in Office, Touch and Cleaning
Last week, we realized that one of our SF-based colleagues might have been exposed to COVID-19.
However, we are very careful, hiring staff to clean up the antivirus to clean up all the places in the San Francisco office.
They used antivirus solutions at hospital to kill viruses on all surfaces as well as waiting rooms and elevator banks to our floor.
The building is using the protocol of personal care obligations that utilize products that support the safety of their members.
We feel that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which is sharing its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC base staff members.
As of last week, our DC office moved to remote setup in accordance with the instructions shared with San Francisco.
Like some NYC-based colleagues know, we also discussed renting a location in Boulevard.
These discussions are being delayed, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working for the first time.
You work together from a distance of our knowledge that it may be correct and want to offer you some advice:
Set the meeting period for at least one or two hours.
If longer is required, please consider how they can break within several days.
A clear meeting schedule has a agenda and sends materials to read in advance.
Make videos by default using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live broadcasts, collaboration and connections.
Led to facilitate every meeting of someone to follow the chat for questions and monitor a list of speakers and someone to help note (or make a cooperative note).
Send email to technology help if you need a convenient headphone.
Use health refunds for snacks.
Please join the #remote network in the Slack program to chat with your colleagues about the work done.
The HR operating team is looking forward to web-based technical guidance to support the increase in the overall distribution work.
Last week, we asked all community grantees to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editathons until the WHO announced that the spread ended.
We let them know that we understand that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions can make it impossible to complete agreed grantmaking activities and that no one will be fined for delay or modifying those goals.
This coming week, we will follow further instructions on Wikipedia and local community and topics.
Common romance from around the world seems to be sad, both annoying but relief at clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and other.
Going forward, CRT is working on creating a Meta-Wiki page to provide space for the community to track our impacts and track our relationships with them.
Keep in touch with COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for Thursday, next week, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share updates, answer your questions, and take some time to communicate with each other.
We meet this problem all and here to help as possible.
At the same time, you can continue to search for information from this email and other important information related to all COVID-19 on the Office Wiki website.
CRT will keep these pages up to date, and all information is at the same place.
We are working to keep a constant relationship with employees living in the country that currently suffers extremely impacted.
If you have any questions about travel, events, main work currents, challenges, insurance or other things you need help, please do not hesitate to inform and work with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and communication as required.
If you have a confidential or sensitive problem, please email Bryan Judan, Director of Global HR International Human Resources.
These changes are not considered to be abolition of our jobs and obligations.
Instead, they are accreditation that at the moment our work and obligations will likely need to adapt in the way we do not have before.
These are the steps we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, provide our movements with the support they need and the world with the services they rely on.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now it’s time to support each other and create a space for important work that will be coming in weeks and have a potential for months.
We need you all to make that happen and so we need you all to take care of yourself and your family so that you can be the best when there is need.
Now wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the remaining leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
An enzyme 2 which transforms the enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outside of the membrane, pneumonia, cardiovascular, kidney, and intestinal.
ACE2 against the activation of Nanden (ACE) involving the reduction of Nanden-II and increasing Ang(1-7) makes it a successful drug target for cardiovascular disease treatment. ACE2 also acts as a point into cells for any coronavirus.
Human enzyme generation is often referred to as hACE2.
Antenna dissipation enzyme 2 is a zinc containing metal elements located on the surface of nylon cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein loaded by N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and acid transmitter domain by C-Tentine kidneys, etc.
ACE2 is the type I solo route of its enzyme membrane, which has its own activity to the surface of lung cells and other cells.
The additional cell domain of ACE2 is separated from the membrane-passed domain by another enzyme known as the servo, while the protein that is soluble is resulting in the release into the bloodstream, and eventually is released into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organics: ACE2 is linked to the cellular membrane of gland cells, type II lungs, cells of the micro-intestinal layer, velvet arteries, and micro-inflammatory cells, and muscle cells of most organic arteries.
ACE2 mRNA is also present in the exterior host of hypothalamus gland striatum and brain cells.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a balancing coordinator to ACE.
ACE cuts antenna hormone I into the Istanbul II joint.
ACE2 separates amino acid, carbonol (carboxyl-terminal amino) from two enzymes (angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe)), and breaks it into anabolic sodium angiotensin vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also kill some other peptides including [des-Arg9] - bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 helps to limit the membrane transmission of amino acid transmission SLC6A19 and is seen in Hartnup's disease.
Due to the ACE2 membrane proteins that act as the key entry point into cells for some infections, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More clearly, the flexibility of S1 proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 into the ACE2 enzyme present on the cell surface, resulting from the dispersing and transforming the position of the virus and enzyme into the indoor, which is in the cell.
The process of the input also requires the necessary S protein through the TMPRSS2 protein in the body, the blocking that is in the observation is a potential treatment. This action makes some people assume that a reduction in ACE2 levels in the cell can help fight the infection.
However, some social and institutional professionals still recommend continuing to use ACE inhibitors and treats by ARB.
A systematic review and analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% decrease in the face of pneumonia compared to consumers.
However, the risk of pneumonia is reduced to patients treated using the ACE inhibitors who have faced higher risks of pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also linked to reduced mortality rates involving pneumonia, although the results are less intense than the risk of pneumonia overall.
The combination of ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered to be a highly exposed pneumonia treatment, and it makes a good evolution of blood flow in the lungs as well as an oxygen concentration associated with lipolysaccharide that causes severe respiratory disorders.
Half the life of rhACE2 in the human body is about 10 hours, and the start of the action is 30 minutes, add to the duration of efficiency (period), 24 hours.
Many findings have shown that rhACE2 can be a successful drug for those who are incompatible to the regular anterior-controllers (RAS blockers) or in various diseases where two enzymatic movements have been increased. The included rhACE2 is evaluated in the clinical trials for severe respiratory symptoms.
The b'COVID-19 program is a mobile application developed to help track the exposure to the global spread of coronavirus in 2019-20, for example, the human identification process associated with infected people.
Many applications are requested or made with official support from some local governments and some jurisdictions.
Many frameworks for creating exposure trackers have been developed.
Privacy concerns are especially raised about the system based on tracking the geographical location of the user of the application.
The options for less likely interference include using Bluetooth signal waves to record distances near any other user’s mobile phone.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced together that they would include functions to support Bluetooth-based software directly into their Android and iOS.
In China, the Chinese government in collaboration with Alipay launched a program that allows citizens to check whether they had been exposed to people with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China, and in Singapore, TraceTogether is being used.
“The program was developed by the local technology community, which is open and will be delivered to the government. North Macedonia has launched the program “StopKorona!”, a Bluetooth app to monitor exposure with those who may be viral and provide quick response to the health authorities.”
The program was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
On April 14, 2020, mobile app awaits approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On April 12, the Royal Government confirmed that the contact tracker is in development phases and will be put into use in the coming weeks. The similar program was planned in Ireland and France (""StopCovid"")."
Australia and New Zealand are considering using TraceTogether and Singapore’s BlueTrace protocol. Russia aims to use a geographical mask for patients who have received COVID-19 diagnosis that are living in Moscow, where the program is created to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, an engineering safety professor of Cambridge University, signed down the number of practical issues that could happen with a system-based program, including positive cases, different from the fact and lack of efficiency if taking this program to utilize smallest populations.
To address concerns about the spread of the "Coronavirus" program that triggers confusion or harm, Apple has restricted the type of organizations that can incorporate coronavirus-related applications into its App Store, limiting only the terms of "official" or institution with a well-known name.
Google and Amazon carry out similar restrictions.
The privacy campaign team has performed concerns regarding the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus software, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure created to address the pandemic problem will be disabled when no threat is available.
Internationalxemptions and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on the type of tracking.
These organizations have announced eight conditions about the government project:
"The surveillance must be ""lawful, necessary and proportional". "
Continuing, monitoring and monitoring will be regulated on validation.
Data consumption will be set for the purpose of COVID-19
Data security and anonymity are protected and proven to be protected based on evidence.
Digital surveillance will be avoided discrimination and difficulty experience.
All sharing data with third parties will be set up in the law.
Must have protection against violations and rights of citizens in response to any violations.
“Meaning participation” from all “relevant shareholders” will require including from public health specialists and subordinate groups. The German (CCC) computer club and unrestricted journalists (Janne Grenzen) (RSF) also issued a checklist.
The Google/Apple plan aims to solve persistent surveillance problems by removing tracking mechanisms from the operating system of their devices when no longer needed.
Some countries use a web-based tracking location instead of the application, eliminating the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, the web for tracking is approved.
Web-based solutions that are capable of using unanalytic location data can have a significant impact on privacy.
However, not all systems with the center must be connected with one person’s location data. The system’s password is created to use the same center in communication (see the following section).
In South Korea, the systems that do not depend on the application are used to carry out exposure tracking.
Instead of using the mobile app, the system collects information from various sources, including mobile devices that track the site’s data and data, and includes these data together to create a notification via a mobile message sent to individuals that may be infected.
In addition to using this information to inform the communications that the government has also made information about the location public, what is permitted due to the dramatic changes of the Privacy Act of Information after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available for the public through some applications and websites. Countries including Germany have also considered using both the central system and the privacy protection system.
As of 6 April 2020, the details have not been released yet.
Monitoring of private communications is a great idea that has been created with important studies since 2013. From April 7, 2020, many experts have conducted a study of the appropriate solutions for privacy such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record distances near any other user’s mobile phone.
However, PEPP-PT is an effort to coordinate with decentralized and decentralized methods and is not the same protocol. The decentralized protocol includes close trackers that can maintain decentralized privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the number of temporary communications (TCN, the number of sensitive communication events, fka, CEN), protocols related to privacy and mechanisms for mobile communication tracking (PACT) and other.
According to this protocol, no private information is leaked from a personal device, and every match is made on the device.
A private group at MIT Media Lab has developed SafePaths, a form of privacy protection technology when collecting and using location data or breakthrough data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on two official research reports, “The Transformer Program is wrongly targeted: Maintaining personal privacy in spreading” published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology development company originally established at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive locations and health data with users and other officials without affecting the privacy of the data.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN League was created by groups together around what matters is the same approach and most overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing the breakthrough and launching the global interoperability of tracking and alarming programs, a key aspect of achieving general adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced it had opened the BlueTrace open source by the government’s official program.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the Android and iOS mobile phone management company, announced the initiative for tracking viral exposure that they claimed will protect privacy based on a combination of Bluetooth technology, using less energy and privacy protection.
They also published the technical characteristics of core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system aims to put out three stages:
There are outlets of government tools to create coronavirus protection trackers.
Integration of this function directly into iOS and AndroidGoogle. And Apple plans to solve ongoing surveillance problems, initially distributing the system by updating the operating system. And then making it withdrawal the same way when the threat goes away.
Reposition change of b'Drug (also known as re-use of the drug, reactivated functioning or treatment change) is a drug use allowed for treatment of the disease or medical condition that differs from what it was originally created.
This is a scientific research that is currently taking steps forward to develop COVID-19 treatment for effectiveness and safety.
Other research directions include creating vaccine vaccine for COVID-19 and a plasma inclusion containing SARS-CoV-2, which contains about 66 types of proteins that each drug has multiple sealing places.

The Remdesivir Pharmaceuticals were created and developed by Gilead scientists for the treatment of Ebola and Marburg virus. Gilead scientists have also found that Remdesivir pharmaceuticals have an activator against the virus, the new membrane, the paramiso and several coronaviruses in the laboratory.
A problem with antivirus treatment is the evolution of resistance through meta-political metabolism that can lead to severe disease and severe infection.
Studies before some trials have shown that medicinal dose can have high steroid barriers to resistance. There are several treatment trials, including two treatments, which are conducted by Cleveland University Hospital. One test for those with moderate disease and another for those with severe disease.
There are three ongoing treatment trials using vitamin C to those who are taking a hospital break and have severe illnesses with COVID-19, two inactive substances with control (China Canada), and another with no control (Italia).
New York State has begun an antibiotic azigic testing on 24 March 2020.

B'A COVID-19 vaccine is an anti-coronavirus vaccine in 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been completed, some other tests are working to develop such vaccine.
By the end of February 2020, the WHO said it would not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a virus that causes death in less than 18 months.
Six vaccine candidates are in the first stage of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A large outbreak spreads worldwide in 2020, leading to a lot of investments and research activities to create vaccine.
Many organisations are using genes that are advertised to create vaccine that can be against SARS-CoV-2.
The necessity of CEPI initiatives for the development of vaccine injection stated in April is the speed of production capacity, deployment, size and global access.
In April, scientists from CEPI reported that there were 10 different technological platforms under research and development in early 2020 to create effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The goal of the main forms, which have reached Phase I security research, includes:
Nuclear acid (DNA and RNA) (first-stage developer and test vaccine:Moderna (Moderna), mRNA-1273)
Viral load factor (producers and first-stage vaccine testers: Cansino Biologics, 5 vector acetate)
According to the CEPI team report, 115 pilot vaccines were in the early stages of development, with 78 vaccines being confirmed as a project running (79 vaccines according to the Milken Institute) 37 other vaccines were announced, but public information had little (presumably that everything was in the project and creation).
Phase I-II test conducts primary safety and immunity tests, usually randomly, medications with control and in many places while determining precise and effective levels.
Phase II test requires multiple participants, including vaccine control teams and test efficiency to prevent diseases while looking for negative effects at the best level.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates who are in the active development phase (certified in early April 2020), 74 vaccine candidates are not yet in human assessment (are in ""pre-treatment"" research")."
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of molecular vaccine that will modify the virus protein to promote immunity reactions.

In March 2020, the U.S. government of three major industrial companies and universities gathered to use IBM’s supercomputer top computer, along with the data storage resources on the air of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have a vaccine effect, or are called an inconsistent effect.
That means they can benefit beyond the disease they protect.
A random study in Australia is enrolling 4,170 health staff to attend.
The possible vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
Recent research from vaccine efficiency in preventing COVID-19 on animal ACE2-transgenic as well as animals in other laboratories, as well as non-human mammals, these doses are for 3rd-level biological safety in viral management and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccination against SARS and MERS has been tested in non-human animal samples.
By 2020, there was no treatment or vaccine of SARS, which was shown to be safe and effective to humans.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing vaccine or therapeutic drug of SARS is the primary priority of government and public health agencies around the world. There is also no vaccine against MERS.
As MERS spreads the existing virus research, it is believed to provide a useful sample for the development of vaccine and treatment against MERS-CoV infections.
As of March 2020, there was a MERS vaccine (based on DNA) that completed a first-stage treatment trial on humans, and another three-stage treatment trials were in the process where they were all a vaccine that used the virus as a agent. Among them were two vector DNA (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and another vector-video (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media has shown a theoretical theory, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been found and that a vaccine is already available.
Patents extracted from social media hosting provide reference to existing patents about genetic order and vaccine for other coronaviruses such as coronavirus SARS.
The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) caused a serious respiratory crisis caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
General symptoms include fever, cough, and short breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, diarrhea, diarrhea, diarrhea, odorless, and abdominal pain.
The duration of the exposure until the first out of the symptoms is about five days, but it can last from two to fourteen days.
While most cases cause mild symptoms, some develop into pneumonia due to viruses and multi-organization damage.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2,24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and regions that cause more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been healed. The virus is primarily spread between people and people in the time they are close to each other often through small droplets produced by coughing or talking.
When these droplets are produced when breathing out, they usually fall to the ground or on the ground rather than far away.
People are infected with surface exposure containing viruses and then affect their eyes, noses, and mouths.
The virus can live outside up to 72 hours.
It is most susceptible during the first three days after the outbreak of symptoms, which means that the infection may be available before the outbreak of symptoms or other stages of the disease. The standard diagnosis of the diagnosis is the number of viruses on the reverse polymer cable reactions to the actual time (rRT-PCR) removed from the samples at the nose and throat.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they contain viruses and their caregivers.
Introducing mass use in different places by some authorities recommending against their mass wear, and others have brought them to use, and others require them to wear masks.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local infections are recorded in most countries across the six regions of the World Health Organization.
Those infected with the virus may have any problems: nothing or evolution into symptoms such as flu, such as fever, fatigue, and short breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, chest pain, or persistent pressure, difficulty, wake up, and dark face, or blue lips. Medical attention is immediately recommended if these symptoms are present.
The upper respiratory syndrome, such as flu, sensation, or pain.
Symptoms of gastrointestinal gastrointestinal diseases such as nausea and diarrhea have been observed at different rates.
Some cases in China first show only chest tightness and chest vibration.
In some cases, the disease may develop into multi-organismal and deadly pneumonia.
This is called the period of growth.
The COVID-19 period of symptoms after the infection must be taken five to six days, but it can also issue symptoms between the second to the 14th day.
97.5% of people who develop into symptoms will have a condition so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports have shown that not all infected people develop that symptom.
The role of an unreleased group of symptoms in the transmission is not yet well known. However, the primary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who have not shown symptoms is not currently known and are studying the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all cases of infection still have no symptoms during hospital stay.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include cases that do not show symptoms in its daily case on April 1st, of the 166 infections on that day, with 130 (78%) of cases that do not show symptoms during the test.
Both the liver and the mouth can contain a lot of viruses.
Strong speech releases more droplets than usual talking.
A study in Singapore found that coughs that are unpacked may cause a droplet to travel to 4.5 meters (15 ft).
Although the virus is generally not influenza, the National Academy of Sciences recommends that the transmission of biogases is possible, the air collectors put on the main hall outside of the human room to create positive models for RNA virus.
Some medical forms such as ventilation and cardiac movement (CPR) can cause external respiratory tracts to stop so that it causes air-contamination.
While there are concerns that it can be passed through the hepatitis, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is susceptible to infection when people have symptoms, while the spread can be possible before the symptoms come out, the risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) has raised that while it is unclear how easily it is to spread the disease, a person can generally replicate from two to three others. The virus can live from hours to days on the surfaces.
In particular, the virus was found to be able to detect a day period on carton for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and for up to four hours on copper 99%.
However, it varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soaps and cotton soaps are also effective if used properly. Soap products damage the virus's fat-protected layers, activates it as well as cleans out of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride (benzalkonium chloride) and chloride chlorine chloride (chlorhexidine gluconate) (viral surgery) are less effective. In studies in Hong Kong, lice samples are taken on average for two days after starting hospital.
Five of the first six samples of patients have found a high number of viruses, and the fifth patient has been shown to have a high number of viruses on the second test.
The severe respiratory symptoms of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are similar to the severe respiratory symptoms of the new coronavirus, which first separated from three patients with pneumonia associated with a group of severe respiratory cases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in coronavirus-related viruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by the indoor soap that causes the blast of its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV virus.
Humidifier is the most affected organic by COVID-19, as the virus accesses the host cell via antenna cell converts to 2 enzyme (ACE2), which is rich in small air bag cells, the second type of lungs.
"The virus uses a special surface-based protein clinic called ""spike""" (peplomer) connected to ACE2 and incorporated the host cell."
Acute heart disease exposure has been found to be 12% of those infected and relaxed in healthcare departments in Wuhan, China, and most of them are severe levels.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the response of system inflammation and the problem of the immune system during the development of the disease, but acute heart attack may also be related to ACE2 recipients in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are strongly shown in the heart and engage in heart function.
High rates of pneumonia cysts (31%) and lens fibers (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to weak evolution. Disadvantages on people killed by COVID-19 have found that there is alveolar damage (DAD) and pulmonary inflammation in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 requires an ACE2 enzyme that is available on the respiratory cells, serious COVID-19 patients have the same symptoms as inflammation.
In particular, the GM-CSF releases T cells, which have shown contact in the inflammation because it is associated with the release of IL-6 from monoocytes and severe pneumonia to COVID-19 patients.
The penetration of limphous has also been reported to have prosecution.
The World Health Organization has announced how many ways to detect the virus.
The standard method of testing is a reaction of a real-time reverse pump chain (rT-PCR).
This test is usually done on samples from a fiberglass respiratory tract. However, a diverse sample or heating sample can also be used.
Generally, results can be realized within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these tests require two blood samples that are separated from each other two weeks, and the results are very little immediate.
Chinese scientists can isolate the coronavirus and promote the gene order, so the laboratory around the world can create an independent polymerase chain reaction test to find infections caused by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, the antibodies test (which can detect active infections and whether a person was previously infected) is in development, but has not been widely used yet.
Chinese experience with test shows accuracy of just 60 to 70%.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first immediate treatment test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month. The introduction of the diagnosis issued by the Wuhan University’s end-of-the-counter hospital introduced the approach to finding infections based on direct treatment characteristics and the risk of pandemic.
Dimension on double-sided multi-sided glass with equipment distribution, inequal and later parts are common in the first infection.
Hard surface subpleural control (the thickness of septal lobular with a variable alveolar filling) and a combination can appear when the disease evolves.
There are very little data that talk about microflammation and COVID-19 syphilis.
The findings of major pathology when theoretical activity are:
What we can see is: Milk in pneumonia, pneumonia, heartbeat, lung, and pneumonia.
It is possible to observe four types of pneumonia:
A mild pneumonia: pneumonia, pneumonia, pneumonia, large pneumonia, is different from normal, internal inflammation with inflammation and mass cell formation.
Heavy pneumonia: Dispersion of many pneumonia bags with liquid evaporation from pneumonia bags.
DAD is the reason why acute respiratory crisis (ARDS) and severe blood oxygen deficiency.
Treatment of pneumonia: the preparation of exudates in the hollows of alveolar and chronic pneumonia
Blood: blood clotting (DIC) Leukoerythroblastic bone reaction
Preventive mechanisms to reduce the chances of infectiousness include home-staying, avoiding places with people, washing hands with soaps and water, often for at least 20 seconds, applying respiratory hygiene care, and avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouths, when not washing hands.
The CDC recommends packing the mouth and nose with the mouth wiped paper when coughing or socks, and recommends using the inner parts of the elbow if there is no mouth wiped paper.
Sanitary hand properly after coughing or coughing is encouraged.
CDC recommends the use of face-walling cloth in public, which is part of the level of transmission of the virus from individuals without symptoms. Social gap methods aim to reduce exposure to people through school closures and workplace restrictions, travel restrictions, and cancel large public gatherings, etc.
The guidelines on keeping the gap also include that people keep the gap apart at least 6 feet (1.8 m).
There are no drugs known to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Since vaccine is not expected to be found yet until 2021, the main part of COVID-19 management is an attempt to reduce the highest level of pandemics known as "Curvical Shrink".
CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often with soap and water at least 20 seconds, especially after entering the toilet or when their hands see dirty before eating and after noseing their cough or socks.
The organization further recommends the use of alcohol-based hand-washing water with at least 60% alcohol, but when it is not available, soap and water are not available. For areas that are not sold, hand-washing, the WHO provides two formulas for local production.
All of these creations, anti-androgenic activity, have increased activity from ethanol (ethanol) or amorphous (isopropanol).
Hydrogen peroxide chemical compounds are used in antibacterial killings that are insomnia, it is not an active substance for hand-in-hand viruses.
Glycerol is added as a moisture-container.
People are controlled by aid care that may include fluid treatment, oxygen delivery, and other important organisms suffering from disease.
CDC recommends those who suspect that they load the virus should wear normal massage.
Extracoreal membrane oxygen absorption (ECMO) is used to solve the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits remain in consideration.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle, as well as diets are recommended to improve the sensitivity.
The preliminary treatment may be useful to those with mild symptoms of the first stage after infection. The World Health Organization as well as the National Health Commission of China has issued a statement on how to maintain COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized in hospitals.
Emergency specialists and pneumonia specialists in the United States have tried to compile the instructions to treat from other agencies into the source of data that can take free files of IBCC.
As of April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend taking paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than taking ibuprofen for early stage use.
The carefulness must be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of viruses, especially in healthcare, when applying forms that can be produced as gases such as air pipelines or hand dryers.
Health professionals are deeply concerned with people with COVID-19, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends putting patients in separate rooms to prevent air infections (AIIR), in addition to the use of standard precautions, precautions, exposure, and air infection caution. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention also issued instructions for using its protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended device is: Custom Virus Protection Medical Jacket, Breathable Device, or Mass Eye Protector, and Medical Gloves. If there is a respiratory device, it should be used as priority (instead of mass).
The N95 protection mask approved for industry settings, but the FDA has allowed the mass for use under emergency use (EUA).
They must be made up to protect air particles such as dust, but the effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for use outside of the official.
When there is no CDC mass, it recommends the use of face protection masks, at least using manual masss.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious, which require respiratory aid, but also a percentage of cases that are needed.
The type of respiratory aid for individuals with respiratory problems relating to COVID-19 is actively studying for people in the Medical Department with some evidence that air ducts can be avoided with advanced nasal clamps or positive respiratory pressure treatment by Bi-level.
Whether both of them lead to the same benefit for people with serious illnesses, or not, that is not yet known.
Some doctors prefer to be with a mechanical ventilation system that is pandemic when possible, because this technique determines the spread of air target particles compared to high flowing cannula nose plug hoses. The severe cases occur generally to older people (who are over 60 years old and especially those who are over 80 years old).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds, which restrict the ability of the health system to address an immediate increase in the number of severe COVID-19 cases needed to be hospitalized enough.
A study in China found that 5% were allowed to enter 2.3% of severe care centers needed medical assistance of ventilation and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people in hospitals with last COVID-19 are allowed to enter ICU.
Mechanical ventilators are more complex as symptoms of hypertensive breathing (ARDS) develop in COVID-19 and oxygen input are more difficult.
High pressure and PEEP form control capacity is necessary to give oxygen most, while reducing the risk of pneumonia injuries and pneumonia.
Advanced PEEP may not be available on the old series winding machine.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir’s broad range of antiviral drugs seem to provide the most successful.
Although new medications can be used until 2021 to produce, some of the medications that have been tested are allowed for other use or are already testing advanced.
Antiviral drugs can be tested for people with severe illness.
The World Health Organization has recommended volunteers to participate in testing the effectiveness and safety of treatment. The FDA has been temporarily permitted by using your blood serum treatment as a clinical experiment in some cases where patients face severe and death.
It did not go through clinical studies necessary to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China developed a mobile app to address the widespread outbreak of the disease.
Users are required to enter their name and ID.
"The application can find ""close communication""" using surveillance data, and so it is possible to know the risk of infection."
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is found, this program is not only recommended for you to make your own personal gadgets, it also informs local health officials. Large data analysis on mobile data, technology, facial recognition, mobile tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agents to track human cell phone data suspected to contain the virus.
Measures are taken to strengthen quarantines and protect those associated with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared phone location data with the German Federation of Science Robert Koch to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deployed face-marking technology to detect fiberglass abusers.
Regional Health Commissioner in Italy, Giulio Gallera, said he received a press release via the mobile company, saying “40% of the people still walk normally.”
The German government developed a 48-hour hackathon program at the end of the week with about 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has called to the world to find innovative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may experience difficult stress from a quarantine, restrictions, travel effects, treatment, or fear of infection.
“The BBC press quoted Rory O’Connor by saying, “The rise of social discrimination, loneliness, anxiety, stress, and economic decline is a great rainfall in the harm of mental health and the well-being of people.”
The disease may occur in mild levels without little symptoms or similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as normal flu.
Usually, mild cases recover within two weeks, while people with severe or severe diseases can take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a high risk of severe infections of COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is missing. For some people, COVID-19 may affect lungs that cause pneumonia.
For those who suffer the most severe side effects, COVID-19 may develop symptoms of severe respiratory pathways (ARDS) that cause respiratory damage due to viruses or multi-organisms.
COVID-19 related consequences include microorganisms, abnormal blood blood, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
An abnormality of blood, especially the increase in prothrombin time, is described in 6% of those who are sent to COVID-19 hospitals, while abnormal kidney function is seen as having 4% of the group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 show an increase in liver enzyme (infectious).
According to the same report, the average period between symptoms start and death is ten days, with five taking a hospital break.
However, patients transferred to ICU have an average of seven days between hospital rest and death.
In the study of the first case, the average time from the first showing of symptoms to death is 14 days, with a period of six to 41 days.
In the study of the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men have a 2.8% mortality rate, while women have a 1.7% mortality rate.
A cellular review of post-death lung samples demonstrates alveolar destruction with fibromyxoid exudates cells in both lungs.
Deformation due to the virus has been observed in the lung cell.
Humidifier images have acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
11.8% of the reported death rate by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage is noted by increasing the levels of gastrointestinal substances or heart crashes.
According to March data from the United States 89% of those who enter hospital rest have conditions such as hospital conditions. The availability of medical resources and social economies of a region can also affect mortality rates.
The estimate of mortality from the condition is different because the area is different, but also because the method in estimates is difficult.
A mild case exclusion can cause the mortality rate to be wrong.
But the fact that death is the result of past related cases can mean that the current mortality rate is estimated too close.
Smokers may have severe symptoms of COVID-19 to 1.4 times, and perhaps 2.4 times may need to be strong or dead, compared to non-smokers. Concerns are raised to long-term illnesses.
Hong Kong Hospital authorities have found a decline in pneumonia for some people who have recovered from the disease from 20% to 30%, and pneumonia scans have shown organic damage.
It can cause post-treatment symptoms after recovery.
As of March 2020, they did not know whether the past infection provided effective and long-term immunity to those who had recovered from the disease.
The immune system has been seen, depending on the characteristics of other coronaviruses, but in some cases, COVID-19 is with a positive test of coronavirus at the next time.
These cases are believed to be more than tens of long-term infections than re-infections.
The virus is thought to have come from nature and originated from animals through the infection.
The real origin is not known yet, but in December 2019 there was an outbreak of the spread of the virus that stimulates human infection to one person.
The study on 41 first cases of COVID-19 infection published in January 2020 in The Lancet magazine showed the first day of the beginning of the symptoms was December 1, 2019.
The official publication of the WHO reported the beginning of the first symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Some measures are often used to confirm the number of deaths.
These numbers vary by regional and over time and are influenced by the amount of quality testing, healthcare system, the choice of time treatment since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender and general health.
By the end of 2019, the World Health Organization appointed the ICD-10 emergency code by the U07.1 for the death of SARS-CoV-2 infections certified by the laboratory and U07.2 for the death of clinical diagnosis or COVID-19 disease without the SARS-CoV-2 infection, which clarified the laboratory. The ratio of death reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in the given time.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate of 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
This number differs from regional. Other measures include death rates (CFR), which reflect the percentage of individuals who have diagnosed who have died due to the disease and the death rate of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed), who died due to the disease.
These statistics are not limited to timelines and follow specific populations from infection through case handling.
While not all infected people create antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of infected people.
In the center of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600, 80 (1.7%), has already died.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease is spread by the Canton Fair and spread to young people, causing a low mortality rate, and not all deaths of COVID-19 can be formally classified.
In addition, the German health system is not covered.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have body-protective antibodies when rating from blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) has been confirmed to have died of COVID-19.
The effects of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different to men and women.
The death rate is high to men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in the age of 50, with the gap between men and women only 90.
In China, the mortality rate is 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The real reason for this variety of sex is not known, but genetic factors and behavioral factors can also be the reason.
The difference between sexual immunity, generality, which decreases smoking to women, and men with the evolution of similar conditions, such as hypertension in younger women, can contribute to high mortality rates for men.
In Europe 57% of people infected with this disease are men and 72% of those who died of COVID-19 are men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government did not track data regarding the sexual infection of COVID-19.
Studies have shown that infectious diseases caused by viruses such as ebola, major influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have high chances of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
World Health Organization Chair Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO represents corona, VI for viruses, D for disease, and 19 for the first time the outbreak was identified as December 31, 2019.
This name is selected to avoid reference to any specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal or human groups in accordance with international recommendations for naming, referring to protection, not to the vulnerabilities. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
In addition, the World Health Organization uses "COVID-19" and "virals, which are the cause of COVID-19" in public communication.
"Generally both the disease and the virus are called "Coronavirus."
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and " Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended the 2019-nCov virus and sharp respiratory disease study 2019-nCoV as a temporary name for viruses and diseases in accordance with the instructions against the use of disease names and virus names in 2015.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limited capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital companies are manufacturing healthcare materials, such as multifilament and air pipe parts.
In an example, when the Italian hospital requires a ventilation valve to come out immediately, and the supplier cannot distribute the need timely, the local new company that creates the rear engineering product and produces 100 capsules of valve needed at night.
After the outbreak of COVID-19 immediately published the theories of false information related to the origin, prevention, treatment and general status of the disease, and all of these information were distributed across the internet.
People seem to have the ability to spread the virus to some animals.
The study did not find evidence of viral replication in pigs and chickens.
No drug or vaccine is recognized in the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccine in the treatment of COVID-19 is under the leadership of the government, organizations, academics, and researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the idea of forming a "common test" to assess the effectiveness of four existing antiviral drugs and find the most effective combinations.
There is no vaccine, but other agents are actively developing vaccine.
Previous study on SARS-CoV is reusable because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are both able to enter human cells through ACE2.
There are three vaccine strategies trials.
First, the researchers aimed at creating a completely antivirus vaccine.
Using such viruses, whether it is inactivation or dying, aims to make the response to the immune system of the human body to new infections with COVID-19.
The second strategy is the subunit vaccine aimed at creating vaccine that stimulates the immune system to parts of the virus.
In case of such SARS-CoV-2+, such research focuses on S-spike proteins, which helps the virus to be absorbed into ACE2 enzymes.
The third strategy is a nuclear acid vaccine (DN or RNA, a technique for innovating vaccine).
An experimental vaccine from one of these strategies will be tested for safety and efficiency. On 16 March 2020, the first vaccine test began with four volunteers in Seattle.
This vaccine has a hazardous genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. Intensification of antibiotic dependence is recommended as a potential challenge for the development of vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but it is a controversial thing.
There are more than 300 active live treatment trials running as of April 2020.
Seven trials have been assessed on approved treatments for dementia, including four studies on hydrochlorine or chlorine.
Most used antiviral drugs help China's research with nine tests of Phase III on Remdesivir drugs across many countries due to reports in late April.
Dynamic reviews on clinical evolution for vaccine-protected vaccine from COVID-19 and the drug candidates put in place and as of April 2020. Many existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for COVID-19 treatment of Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Lopinavir/ Ritonavir mixed with Interferon beta.
There are temporary evidence for efficiency by Remdesivir as of March 2020.
Improved disease condition development has been observed on patients receiving remdesivir therapy.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chlorine used to treat dementia studied in China in February 2020 with primary results.
But there are calls for a review of research.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorine.
However, Wuhan’s Institute of Viral Science recommends taking only one gram of medication, and if we use two grams, it will face extremely dangerous and possibly death.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA Federal Agency issued an open statement allowing the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine immediately in accordance with the doctor’s decision to treat patients with COVID-19. China’s seventh introduction also allowed interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for against COVID-19.
Primary data shows that the ribavirin level is necessary to block SARS-CoV-2 in medical laboratories.
Nitazoxanide has been proposed further studies after finding low levels of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Other studies have shown that there is protein release through the membrane of protease serine 2 (TMPRS2) cells necessary for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors through the ACE2 receiving cells.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for use with or without use with azithromycin is a major problem due to the prevention of the medical group that this treatment should be used without much study. Oseltamivir does not stop SARS-CoV-2 and also has no role in treating COVID-19.
Cytokine increases can be a consequence of the last stage of COVID-19 severity.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may block the rise of cytokine cells. Tocilizumab is also included in treatments according to the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study is completed.
It is in the second phase of the test, not by accident at the national level in Italy after showing positive results to those with serious illnesses.
Along with seromatine blood tests to identify Cytokine Storms, it means to counter such developments that are considered to be the cause of death to some affected people.
The steroid refractory cytokine was approved by the FDA based on post-case research for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine in 2017, caused by various causes of CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
To date, there is no randomly controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring purified antibodies and gathering produced by the immune system that has been recovered from COVID-19 to people in need, it is being observed as a method of vaccination without vaccination.
This strategy is tested for SARS with uncertain results.
Viral conviction is a mechanism of expected action by inactivation therapy that can adapt protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, there are other possible mechanisms such as cytotocin, cell-dependent cells, and/or paccitosis.
For example, another form of passive antibodies treatment using the manufactured calcium is in the development phase.
The production of seromium for people who have had blood disease from those who have been healed from the virus is a certain type of receptor against the virus that has just been created.
Coronaviruses are a group of closely related symptoms.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who was later infected and died by COVID-19 after he spoke with an understanding of the spread of the virus.
