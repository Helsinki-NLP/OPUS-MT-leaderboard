The economic reform was made for the first time under the leadership of Da Nang.
Since then, China’s economy has grown 90 times.
For the first time, China exported more cars last year than Germany and surpassed the United States to become the largest market for the industry.
China’s GDP earnings can surpass the United States in the next two decades.
Danielle's tropical storm, the fourth storm named during the 2010 storm season in the Atlantic, formed in the eastern Atlantic region.
The storm is about 3,000 miles away from Miami, Florida with a wind speed of up to 40 mph (64 kph).
Scientists from the National Hurricane Report Center predicted that Danielle’s tropical pressure would be strong on Wednesday.
Since the storm has long been landing in the land, it is still difficult to assess the extent of impact on the United States or the Caribbean.

Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I saw a terrible scene when people tried to break the window out.
It is used to hit the glass, but the window doesn’t break.
“A glass was finally tank and they began to get out of the window,” said Franciszek Kowal, a survivor.
Stars emit light and heat because the energy is created when the hydrogen is combined (or compound) to create more severe elements.
Scientists are studying to create a reactor that can generate energy this way.
However, this is a very difficult problem to solve, and it will take years for us to see useful power plants built.
Steel metal floating on the water due to surface tension.
Surface tensions occur because of the gravity between water molecules on the water surface is larger than the gravity with the gas molecules above them.
Water molecules create an invisible layer of skin on the surface of the water that allows things like a needle to float on the surface of the water.
The knife blade of modern ice skating shoes is the double tongue and has a farming groove in the middle. The double knife blade helps the shoe stick to the ice side better, even at the tilt angle.
Due to the bottom of the light curved blade, when the knife leans to one side or the other, the side of contact with the tape also curves.
This helps the skates to change direction. If the skates to the right, the skates will turn to the right, and if the skates tilt to the left, the skates will turn to the left.
To return to the initial energy level they must remove the excess energy they are loaded from light.
They do this by launching small light matter particles called "photon".
Scientists call this process "influencing stimulation" because atomic particles are stimulated by light, creating the emission of light photons, and light is a kind of radiation.
The next picture shows that the nuclear is launching the photon. Of course, in fact the photon is much smaller than in the image.
The photons are even smaller than those that form atoms!
After hundreds of hours of lighting the bulb’s hair was finally burned and the lights were no longer light.
The lamp should then be replaced. It must be careful to replace the lamp.
First, you have to turn off the lighting switch or disconnect the cable.
That’s because the entry line in the socket where the metal parts of the lamp can make you get serious shock if you touch inside the socket or pave the lamp when part is still in the socket.
The main body of the circulatory system is the heart, taking care of the work of pumping blood throughout the body.
Blood from the heart flows in pipelines called arteries and flows into the heart in the pipelines called the veins. The smallest pipeline is called masculinity.
The teeth of three horns dinosaur can not only crush the leaves but also hard trees and roots.
Some scientists believe that Triceratop dinosaur eats rice trees, a plant that has a lot in the White Pleasure.
These trees look like small palm trees with sharp leaves.
Triceratop can use its hard mine to clean the leaves before eating the body.
Other scientists think that these plants are very toxic so it is unlikely that dinosaur eats, although today, lazy and other animals like carrots (a descendants of dinosaur) can eat leaves or poisonous fruits.
How does the satellite’s gravity draw me? If you stand on the surface of the satellite, you’ll be lighter than on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pao (90kg) on Earth will weigh about 36 pao (16kg) on Io. So, of course, gravity will be less impact on you.
The sun does not have a shell like Earth that we can set foot up. The whole sun is made up of gas, fire, and plasma.
As far as the sun’s heart, this gas is more diluted.
The outer part that we see when we look at the sun is called the photometer, which means “the need for light.”
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope that observed Sao Kim had cycles like the moon.
The pha occurs because only one side of the Kim (or the Moon) is facing the Sun. The phases of Kim have contributed to the evidence to the Copernicus theory that the planets that turn around the Sun.
A few years later, in 1639, Jeremiah Horrocks, an English astronomer, observed Kim’s pathway.
Britain had a long time living in peace after recapture of Danelaw.
However, in 991, Ethelred faced the largest Viking fleet since the Guthrum era in the last century.
The fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian native, and ambitiously regained the country from Danish domination.
After the first military failures, King Etherlred could agree with the terms with Olaf, who returned from Norway to try to regain his kingdom with mixed success.
Hangeul is a alphabet invented only for everyday use. The alphabet was invented in 1444 in the reign of King Sejong (1418 – 1450)
King Sejong was the fourth king in the Joseon Dynasty and one of the most respected kings.
Initially, he named the Hangeul alphabet the main Nuclear, meaning "precision sound to guide people."
There are many theories around the birth of the Persian language. One of them is about an Aryan migration from the west into India carrying their language.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the Latin language used in Europe.
The first known book in the world is written in the Czech language. After the compilation of Austrian Letter, the Czech language is faded due to quarantine.
Polish is a very complex and rich language, used as a reference source for modern Indian languages, like Latin is the origin of European languages such as French and Spanish.
When the French war ended, Germany began preparing to invade the British island.
Germany identified the attack as "Marine Lion Campaign". Most heavy weapons and British military reconnaissances were lost when evacuated from Dunkirk, so their troops were quite weak.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could have destroyed any invasive fleet that moved through the British Strait.
However, few of the Royal Navy's fleets were closed on routes that could be invaded because the Admirals were concerned that their ships would be sunk by the German air force.
Let’s start with the explanation of Italy’s plan. It’s basically the “best” of Germany and Japan.
They had a weaker army and naval army, although they learned to build only four new ships before the start of the war.
Italy’s main objectives are countries in Africa. In order to win those countries, they will need to have a base of military residence so that their troops can sail over the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
Therefore, they need to remove the British bases and battleships in Egypt. In addition to those tasks, Italian battleships have no other role.
Now consider Japan. Japan is a country island, just like England.
The submarines are the ships designed to run under the water and continuously operate there for a long time.
The submarine was used during World War I and World War II. They were very slow and had limited ranges of shots.
At the time of the start of the war, most of them went on the sea, but when the multi-machine started to grow and became more accurate, submarines were forced to go under the water to avoid being detected.
The German submarine was named U-Boat. The Germans were very good at driving and operating their submarines.
With their success on submarines, after the German war was not trusted to own many submarines.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, also known as "King Tut", "Small King", is one of the most famous Egyptian kings in modern times.
Interestingly, he was not seen as very important in ancient times and had no name in most ancient kings.
However, finding his part in 1922 made him famous. While many past tombs were stolen, the tomb was almost uninterrupted.
Most of the objects buried by King Tutankhamun have kept the status, including thousands of items made from precious metals and rare stones.
Investigating the nanny wheels makes the Assyrian horses carriers lighter, faster and more willing to defeat other soldiers and vehicles.
The arrows fired out of their fearful shell could pass through the armor of the enemy soldiers. Around 1000 BC, the Assyrians launched the first cavalry force.
“The warrior is a battle army on the back of the horse. And then the horse is not invented, so the Assyrian cavalry rides away from the battle.”
We know a lot of Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps the most famous of this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet, the author of two Greek literary masterpieces: Iliad and Odyssey school.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular and their plays are considered to be the world's greatest literary works.
Another name of Greece is Pythagoras mathematician, most known by the theoretical link between square triangle edges.
There are many different estimates of how many Hindi speakers are. It is estimated that this is the second and fourth popular language in the world.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether or not the combination of languages is closely related to each other.
It is estimated that about 340 million to 500 million people speak, and 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu are similar in terms of vocabulary, but in writing; in daily conversations, those who speak both languages can often understand each other’s intentions.
Around the 15th century, the northern part of Estonia was influenced by German culture.
Some German priests wanted to bring God closer to the native, so they created the Hebrew language.
It is based on the German alphabet and a character "total" added.
Over time, there are a lot of words borrowed from German combined. This is the beginning of the Enlightenment Period.
Traditionally, the successor of the throne will participate in the military as soon as he learns.
Charles, however, graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, the Agricultural and Archaeology, then the History and Class 2:2 (average).
Prince Charles was the first member of the British Royal Government to be awarded a university degree.
Turkey in Europe (eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula) consists of 3% of the country.
Turkey's territorial territory is over 1,600 km (1,000 mi) and 800 km (500 mi) wide, which looks like a rectangular.
Turkey's water area, including lakes, accounted for 783,562 km<sup>2</sup> (300,948 square miles), including 755,688 km<sup>2 </sup>(291,773 square miles) of southwest Asia and 23,764 km<sup>2 </sup>(9,174 square miles) belong to Europe.
Turkey's area is the 37th largest country in the world, and it is the size of the French and British Metropolitan Municipality combined.
Turkey is surrounded by seas on three sides: Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history but its independence only started in 1839.
Many of Belgium’s current regions were previously the land of Luxembourg but later belong to Belgium since the Belgian Revolution of 1830.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain neutral, but it has been occupied by Germany in both World War I and II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of today’s organization known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is the ruin of a Buddhist monastery and monastery located in the upper part of Paro County (in Phondey Village).
In 1649, Zhabdrung Russianwang Namgyel set up the fortress to commemorate his own victory over the ancient Tibetan.
In 1951, a fire left only some of Drukgyal Dzong's monuments, such as the image of Zhabdrung Russiawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and remains one of Bhutan's most impressive attractions.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was clamped between the two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.

Every year in October, nearly 1.5 million grass-feeding animals move toward the southern plain, crossing the Mara River, from the northern hills to the rains.
And then back north through the west, again across the Mara River, after the rainy season around April.
Serengeti region includes Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Reserve, Maswa Wildlife Care and Conservation Park in Tanzania and Maasal Mara National Reservation in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires standard and traditional skills, as well as professional tools in interactive classes (building plots, audio editing and video, storytelling, etc.).
Interactive design requires you to reevaluate your assumptions about media production and learn to think in non-linear ways.
Interactive design requires the components of the project to be connected together, but also makes sense as a separate entity.
The downside of the zoom lens is the complexity of focus and the amount of lens details needed to achieve a larger range of focus length than one focus lens.
This becomes increasingly simple when lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production.
This helps the amplifier lens to create images with quality that are comparable to the image created by a fixed focus lens.
Another disadvantage of the zoom lens is the maximum opening of the lens (take speed) normally low.
This makes it difficult for cheap lenses to be used in lack of light without flashing.
One of the common problems when trying to convert films to DVDs is to scan the stack.
Most TVs are designed to please the public.
For the reason to say above, what you see on television has the upper, lower, and two sides.
This to make sure the image can cover the full screen. It is called a peripheral stack scan.
Unfortunately, when you do a DVD, its border section will probably be cut off, and if the video has subtitles too close to the bottom, they won’t show it all.
The ancient medieval castle has long been the inspiration of creativity, evoking the image of the fighting horses, orchestras and knights under King Arthur.
Even in the middle of thousands of years old monuments, you can feel the sound and smell of the wars that have been over for a long time, almost heard the crust on the cucumber and smells of fear from the tunnel.
But whether our imagination is based on reality? Why are people originally building the castle? How is the castle designed and built?
As a typical example for this stage, the Kirby Muxloe Castle resembles a reinforced and room house rather than a real castle.
Large glass-mounted windows and fragile walls will not be able to withstand long-term attacks.
In the 1480s, when King Hastings began to build, the country was quite peaceful and just defended to fight small wandering bands.
Power balances are a system in which European countries seek to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states.
The idea is that all European countries must seek to prevent a country from becoming too strong and so national governments often change their allies to maintain their balance.
The Spanish Condemn War marked the first war that the central issue was the balance of power.
This marked a significant change because the European powers would no longer be due to religious war, so the thirty-year War would be the last war that was attached to the religious war.
Artemis Temple in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BC for the burning act of Herostratus.
According to legend, his goal is to become famous at all costs. The Ephesians have been angry to claim that Herostatus’s name will never be recorded.
Later, the Greek historian Strabo recorded that name and was circulated to this day. The temple was destroyed on the right day that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to reconstruct the temple but was rejected. Later, when he died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible when pressing all the correct music notes – and try not to make many unnecessary finger movements.
Playing the forum in this way will help you lose your maximum strength. Remember, you don’t need to use a lot of force to press the key to increase the volume as when playing the piano.
On the paddle, to increase the volume, you use a stronger or faster blower tube.
Mysticalism pursues relationships, recognizes or recognizes the ultimate reality, character, spiritual truth, or God.
The believers seek a direct, intuitive experience or deep understanding of spiritual reality/one or more gods.
participants pursue different ways of life, or practice to nurture those experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious faith and worship by emphasising the personal experience directly on a single consciousness state, especially the experiences that have a sense of nature, deep, joy, or easy to export.
Sikh is a religion that originated from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in Punjab in the 15th century from a sect division within the traditional Hinduism.
The Sikhs view their faith as a separate religion from India, although they acknowledge the origins and traditions from India of that religion.
Sikh followers call their religion Gurmat, that is Punjabi because of the way of guru.” Guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikh religion has played an important role in forming the core of Sikh’s thought.
This religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469–1539). The next is the appearance of another nine professors.
In June 1956, however, an uprising riot in Poland challenged Krushchev's commitments. Initially only protests against the scarcity of food and workers' wages, but later turned into a joint protest against Communistism.
Although Krushchev eventually moved the tank to reset the order, he also conceded for some economic demands and agreed to appoint Wladyslaw Gomulka, a people’s trust, as a new prime minister.
The Indies of the Indieval River is a Bronze Civilization in the northwestern Subcontinent region of India, including most of Pakistan today, some parts of the northwestern India and northeast Afghanistan.
Indus River Basin, the civilization has since been named.
Although some scholars speculated that because it existed in the basins of the Sarasvati River, this civilization needed to be called Indus-Sarasvati Civilization, although some called the Harappan Civilization by Harappa, the first monument of this civilization was excavated in the 1920s.
The military nature of the Roman Empire contributes to the further development of medical advances.
Doctors began to be recruited by Emperor Augustus and even established the first Roman Medical Group to use after the battles.
Physicians now have an understanding of sedative drugs, including morphin extracts from peanuts and scopolamines from grass seeds.
They have grown up in the genus cut-off procedure to save patients from the osteoporosis as well as the technique of holding blood and clamping arteries to prevent blood flow.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has achieved many achievements in the field of medicine and created many of the knowledge we know today.
Origami Pure is the type of origami with the rule that is only folded one shape, more complex folding styles such as combined are not allowed, and all foldings must be straight.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help people who do not have experience in the documentary or who have limited athletes.
Children develop awareness of races and racial stereotypes early and these racial stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children of a minority or immersed population who do not study well at school tend to not learn well at school once they know about their race-related stereotypes.
MySpace is now the third popular website in the United States with 54 million user profiles.
These sites attract a lot of attention, especially in the educational environment.
There are also positive aspects of these websites as easy to build a page that can include blogs, videos, photos and other features.
This page can be easily used by providing only a web address, making it easy to remember and easy to beat machines for students who have difficulty using the keyboard or spell.
It can be adjusted to make it easy for reading and many or less colors as desired.
The reduction of attention "is a neurological syndrome characterized by three symptoms that include spraying, losing focus, uplifting or overenergy."
This is not a learning defect, but a learning disorder; it "fluids up to 3 to 5% of the total children, possibly up to 2 million American children."
Kids with reduced attention disorders (ADD) are difficult to focus on things like school exercises, but they can focus on things they like, like playing games, watching favorite cartoons or writing sentences without dots.
These children tend to engage in many troubles, as they “take into dangerous behaviors, fight and challenge the authorities” to stimulate their brains, because their brains cannot be stimulated by conventional methods.
The reduction of attention affects the relationship with friends because other children can’t understand why this child behaves like this, why it’s speaking so or how their maturity is different.
When the ability to gain knowledge and learning changes in the above-mentioned way, the basic speed of learning will also change.
The approach to obtaining information is different. There is no longer pressure in individual recovery, but the ability to recover text becomes more focused.
In essence, the Renaissance period has made a major change in how to research and spread knowledge.
Unlike other primates, human beings no longer use their hands to move or support body weight or to swing on the tree.
The hands and feet of the crystal are the same size and length, which reflect the use of the hand to lift the body when following the anti-hand type to the ground.
Your hands are shorter than your feet, and there are more straight burns.
Hand bone fossils from two to three million years old show the transformation in the specialization of hand from moving to operation.
Some people believe that experiencing many waking dreams due to regular human impact is enough to cause fatigue.
The main cause for this phenomenon is the result of waking dreams extending time between REM states.
With less REM every night, the state in which you experience real sleep and your body recovers becomes less likely to become a problem.
This is as tired as you have to wake up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch the TV.
The effect depends on your brain frequency trying to dream of awakening every night.
Almost since the beginning, things were not very good for the Italians in North Africa. Within a week since Italy declared war on 10 June 1940, the 11th British cavalry regimen took hold of the Capuzzo Fort in Libya.
During the Eastern Bardia attack, the British army captured the 10th General of the Italian Army, General Lastucci.
On 28 June, Marshal Italo Balbo, who took full power of Libya and was the clear heir of Mussolini, was killed by the same party when landing in Tobruk.
Modern earnings are played at a variety of levels, from students studying at the University to professionals and Olympics.
This sport plays primarily in a bilateral form, a double-handed fighter with another person.
Golf is an entertainment activity in which players use sticks to polish into the hole.
A conventional round consists of eighteen holes, with players usually starting at the first hole in the yard and ending at the eighteenth hole.
Players need a few times to hit or the most stick to complete the ball line will win.
This game is played on grass, grass around the hole is cut shorter and is known as green area.
Perhaps the most popular type of tourism is the type that most people combine when traveling, which is entertainment tourism.
It’s when people go to a different place far from their daily life to relax and find joy.
Beaches, amusement parks and campuses are the most popular places that tourists often come.
If the purpose of visiting a particular location is to learn the history and culture in that place, this type of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Visitors can visit many different sights of a particular country or they can choose to focus only on visiting a certain area.
To see this move, the People also called for relief.
The reinforcement for the rumors including the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments had 200 soldiers, under the command of Colonel John Stark and James Reed.
The Stark side entered the defensive position along the fence north of the location of the People’s Party.
When the tide down opened a gap along the mysterious river flowed across the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly expanded the fence with a short stone wall toward the north extending to the edge of the water on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark buried a pile in front of the fence about 100 feet (30 m) and ordered no one to be shot until the enemy passed through that stake.
The U.S. plan is based on co-ordinating attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder will open a suspect attack against the British military's station in Bordentown, to block any reinforcement.
General James Ewing will take 700 soldiers across the river in the Trenton ferry, occupying the bridge through Assunpink and blocking the enemy from escape.
The main attack force included 2,400 people going across the nine-mile river north of Trenton, and then divided into two teams, one under the command of Greene and one under Sullivan's command, to conduct the attack before dawn.
With a change from 1/4 to 1/2 mile running, the speed becomes much less important and durability becomes a prerequisite.
Of course, a first-class athlete on the half-mile track, who can go to the destination before two minutes, must own a quite large speed, but endurance must be cultivated at every dangerous challenge.
The best way to prepare for the running season is to run across the country during the winter, in combination with the upper body part training.
Applying a reasonable nutritional diet can’t create an excellent performance, but it can significantly impact overall health for young athletes.
Maintaining healthy energy balance, practicing effective drinking habits and understanding every aspect of additional exercise can help athletes improve their achievements and increase their sports preferences.
The average hierarchical is a relatively cheap sport. However, there are now many wrong ways of understanding the necessary equipment for participating in this sport.
Products can be purchased if needed, but there will be almost little or no real impact on the style.
Athletes may feel like a product even if it does not benefit.
The atom can be seen as the basis of all matter.
According to the Bohr model, this is an extremely complex entity that includes a nuclear with orbital orbited electrons, almost like planets that revolve around the sun – see Figure 1.1.
There are two types of particles - neutron and proton.
Proton carries positive electrical power while neutron does not carry the electrical charge. Electron carries a negative charge.
When checking the victim, you have to look at the scene first to secure yourself.
You need to pay attention to the location of the victim as you move closer to them and notice if there is a red flag.
If you are hurt when you try to help, you may only make the problem worse.
Research shows that depression, fear and indirect cognitive disorders are the relationship between pain and inefficient with those with lower back pain.
Only the effects of tragedy, not depression or fear, are subject to physical activities designed weekly.
The participants of normal activity have asked for more help in a negative awareness of distinguishing the difference between chronic pain and comfort in normal physical activity.
The vision, or the ability to see depends on sensitive organs in the visual or eye system.
There are many different types of structures of the eye, with complexity depending on the needs of the organism.
Different structures have different possibilities and have separate sensitivity to different wavelengths and have different crystallizations. These structures also require different processing processes for meaningful input information as well as different numbers, for optimal operation.
A population is a collection of many organisms of a particular species in a certain geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are identical to a specific shape feature, they are called single shapes.
When someone shows a lot of mutations of a specific feature, it says they have a multiviolet personality.
The crystals move and also make nests in different stages.
During the period of moving from place to place, the army escalator moved at night and stopped somewhere at daytime.
The period of the flock begins from the biblical phase when the food is available is reduced. During this period, the flock creates temporary nests that change every day.
Each of these pastors or marches lasted to approximately 17 days.
What is the cell? From the cell stems from Latin "cella", meaning "small office", and is first used by a researcher who observes the structure of wood under the microscope.
Cells are the basic unit in living entities, and all organs are made up of one or more cells.
Cells are fundamental and essential to studying life, so they are often referred to as "the bricks that build life."
The divine system maintains the balance of the lips by transmitting nerve pulses throughout the body to ensure the flow of blood circulation without being clogged.

Animals are made of cells. They eat and digest food inside. Most animals can move.
Only brain-based animals (although not all animals have brains; for example, cirrhosis does not have the brain).
Animals live all over the earth. They dig the cave in the earth, swim under the ocean and fly in the sky.
The cell is the smallest unit of function and structure in the body.
The cell comes from the word cella in Latin which means a small room.

They look like rooms. He was the first to watch the dead cell.
Elements and compounds can be transferred from one state to another without changing.
Nitrogen has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is more dense, but the molecule is the same.
Water is another example. Water compound is made up of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom

Although the physical state has changed, the chemical state remains intact.
Time is something that always revolves around us, and affects all of our actions, but it is also difficult to understand.
Religious, philosophical and scientific scholars have studied time for thousands of years.
We experience time through a series of events from the future that pass through the present and become the past.
Time is also the way we prepare for the duration of the event.
You can mark the time by yourself by observing the cycle of the circulating event. The circulatory event is something that happens repeating regularly.

During the long period of the 18th and 21th centuries, it was said that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Maori, who hunted giant birds named moa.
The theory later came up with the idea that Maoris migrated from Polynesia in the Great Corps and won New Zealand from Morioris' hands, forming agricultural society.
However, new evidence suggests that Moriori is a group of maori continental migrations from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands that develop their own, unique culture of peace.
There are other tribes on the Chatham Islands, which are Maori migrants from New Zealand.
They call themselves Moriori; some struggles happened and the Morioris were finally deleted.
Individuals who have been involved for decades help us assess our ability and passion, but also take a straight assessment of difficulties and failure.
When listening to others share their own story, family, and organizations, we collect valuable knowledge of the past and some of the characters that have a good or bad influence on the culture of that organization.
Although understanding of a person’s history does not mean to bring cultural understanding, it also helps people understand the situation in the organization’s history.
During the assessment of successes and awareness of failures, each individual and all participants will discover more about the values, missions, and control forces of this organization.
In this case, reminiscent of previous cases of start-up and successful results has made people more open to new changes and directions for the local church.

Convenient thinking is a problem-solving technique by combining different ideas or fields to find solutions.
Mind focus is speed, reasonableness and accuracy, as well as actual identification, reapplication of available techniques, information collections.
The most important factor of this thought is: there is only one right answer. You are only thought of two answers, right or wrong.
This type of thought involves a certain science or process.
People with this way of thinking have the ability to reason, remember patterns, solve problems, and perform scientific tests.
To date, humans are the best species in reading the thoughts of others.
That means we can predict what others are planning to trust or desire.
In these possibilities, understanding the intentions of others is very important. It helps us solve the possible ambiguities of behavioral behavior.
For example, when you see someone breaking the car lens, you can assume that he’s wanting to steal a stranger’s car.

MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear (NMR), discovered by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University) in the 1930s.
In this resonance, magnetic force and radio waves create atoms that emit super small radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a medical doctor and scientific researcher, found the basis for the use of resonance imaging from a medical diagnosis tool.
Four years later, this invention was patented. This is the first patent in the world to be granted to the MRI field.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the first "organized" MRI scanner, which he called "Dead".
Misfit communication methods encourage taking time to think and react to others.
This method helps students learn at the appropriate pace according to their ability and control the rate of the information conservatives communicated.
In addition, the time limit also decreases because it can be arranged for versatile hours of work. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet and the Web system helps learners access information all the time.
Students can also send questions to teachers at any time of the day and will be answered quite quickly, instead of waiting for the next meeting.
The post-modern approach to learning helps get rid of absoluteism. Not only is there a good way to learn.
“There’s actually nothing good to learn. Learning takes place in the experience between learners and knowledge presented.”
Our current experience with all self-made programs and information programs, learning demonstrates this point.
Many of us see ourselves watching TV shows that teach us some knowledge of a process or experience that we will never participate or apply.
We will never take a car, build a nozzle in the backyard, travel Peru to explore ancient ruins, or fix it to the neighbor’s house.
