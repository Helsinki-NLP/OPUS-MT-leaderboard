When the small group of living creatures (small) is separated from the large group they used to be (such as if they move on the mountain range or the river or if they move to the new island, they are not susceptible to return), often they seek to live in an environment other than the environment they’ve ever lived before.
The new appliance is that there are many different resources and competitors, so the number of new people will need different features or adaptations to become competitors that are stronger than they have ever had to have before.
The number of natives has not changed, they still need adaptation as before.
Soon, when new people begin to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less like others.

On the savana field, it is difficult for mammals to have digestive systems like humans to meet the amino acid conditions by obtaining from the available plant resources.
In addition, the lack of this did not have serious consequences such as: disruption to growth, fatigue, nutrition, and eventually death can be lost.
The most convenient plant resources will be the source of proteins found in vegetable leaves and vegetables, but the family is like we are hard to digest these foods, except to cook it.
On the other hand, food comes from an animal (egg swine) not only easily soluble, but they also provide a lot of proteins that contain essential amino acids.
