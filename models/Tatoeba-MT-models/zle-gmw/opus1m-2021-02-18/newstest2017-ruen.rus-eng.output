28-year-old cook found dead at the San Francisco mall.
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell of a local shopping center this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone who wants to hurt him, saying, "He's finally getting along."
The body found in Westfield Moll on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, reported by the San Francisco Forensic Bureau.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that the death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, told KGO's ABC radio station in San Francisco that Frank, the former chef of the distribution line in Boston, had received his dream job as a cook at the San Francisco's Sons & Daghters restaurant six months ago.
Sons & Doughers said they were "shocked and depressed" by his death.
"We're a small team that works as a close family and will be very missed," said the representative.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult period.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was staying at the hostels first, but lately, "He's finally getting along well."
"He found an apartment, he dated a girl," Luis Galicia said to KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a great heart.
His way of communicating with his family has always been to make us some dish, make us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any fight.
He was a brother who sailed along the river.
"With all the bad things that are happening to this world, he was the unbridled diamond that shined brightly every day," he said.
Everyone in possession of information is asked to call the SPPD Hot Line at number 415-575-4444.
Churkin said that the UN Sobbeza meeting on Crime was useful.
The Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, said that the last UN Security Council meeting on Crime had been useful, transmitting Interfax.
"I think the discussion was good for us, and we gave them information about what happened," said Churkin.
He explained that, in closed consultations, he had provided Member States with information on incidents in the territory of the Republic of Crimea and read out a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, which “expressed concern and indignation about the attempted terrorist attack and sabotage in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.

Italy ' s public debt increased to record
Italy's public debt amounted to more than 2.248 trillion euros in June 2016.
At the central bank, the country stated that this amount was the historical maximum and transmitted to RIA News.
The previous negative record was set in May this year.
At that time, the government debt amounted to 2,228 trillion euros.
It is noted that Italy's debt burden increased by Euro77.2 billion in the first half of the year.
Italy ' s public debt at the end of 2015 was previously reported to be 132.7 per cent of the country ' s GDP.
Meanwhile, the Italian Minister of Economy and Finance, Pierre Carlo Padoan, projected a decline to 130.9 per cent in 2016 and 123.4 per cent of GDP in 2018.
The airport paid 141 victims at Domodedovo.
141 people received charity payments from the Aviation Foundation, which was set up by the management of Domodedovo Airport to assist victims of the 2011 terrorist attack, reports Interfax.
According to the Spokesperson for the airport, Alexander Vlasov, two more statements are currently under consideration.
“The fund continues to provide charitable assistance to victims of the 2011 terrorist attack and provides full assistance to address existing issues”, Vlasov added, recalling that a site of the fund was created specifically to facilitate interaction with victims, providing full information on the way in which the charitable assistance is provided.
In 2011, an explosive device was detonated by a suicide bomber in the arrival hall of foreign airlines.
37 people were killed in the attack, and 172 others were injured.
Scientists found an animal that could live for 500 years
An international group of biologists has concluded that the longest-lived vertebrates are the Greenland Polar Shark, which can live for about 500 years, transfers RT.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is more than five meters long, can be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that low metabolism plays an important role in the longevity of sharks, leading to slow development.
Females of Greenlandic sharks reach puberty only by the age of 150.
Previously, it was thought that the longest vertebrate animals lived in the shark's neighbor, the Greenland whale.
The oldest man known as the scientist was just over 210 years old.
Putin has changed the composition of the Sovbez Russian Federation.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, by decree, changed the composition of the Russian Security Council and informed the Kremlin press service.
It was previously reported that Putin had removed President Sergei Ivanov's head of administration, and Anton Vineaux had been appointed his successor.
Ivanov will now serve as a special representative of the President on environmental, environmental and transport issues.
From among the permanent members of the SC, the Russian Federation excluded the deputy of the Council, Rashid Nurgaliev.
The council includes Sergey Ivanov, Anton Vineno, the half-presidency of the President of the FOS, Sergey Maneilo, and half-presidency of the FZFO, Nikolai Tsukanov.
Sergei Ivanov has been relieved of his position as head of the President's administration.
By decree of President Sergei Ivanov, he was dismissed from office as head of the Kremlin administration.
Ivanov has been appointed special representative of the Russian Federation for environmental, environmental and transport activities.
Anton Vineaux, formerly Deputy Sergei Ivanov, has been appointed as the new chief of administration.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov himself asked him to move to another job.
Should we go to the sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief physician of the Olga Bogos sanatorium.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of working, should he go to the sanatorium?
We need a sanatorium resort not only for treatment, but also for disease prevention.
Under sanatorium conditions, a person can check his or her body and receive advice from a doctor on how to live so that his or her health does not deteriorate.
No one would need such advice.
"I'm just tired of working" is an important signal to my body, and it's not to be thrown away.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And the stress is around 90% of the people coming in.
It is particularly vulnerable to people from large cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it's best not to complicate the situation and let yourself rest on time.
Research shows that 98% of people have reduced their biological age while in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfort for the whole family.
So if you want to spend your vacation with the kids, you won't have to leave them.
For children, even the youngest, there are health programmes that include both diagnostic services, paediatric consultations, testing and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children’s pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, and physical exercise.
The course of the procedure is determined by the doctor on the basis of individual evidence and the characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, the sanatoriums tend to operate a children ' s club with animators, where children can attend games and various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with infants, provide the necessary facilities and provide a skilled nanny.
The soft winter, the long summer, the abundance of sunny days in the year (over 300) provides a good environment for a round-the-year holiday at the Caucasus Mineral Water resorts.
And then the body doesn't just need to rest in the summer.
So you don't have to be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most of the procedures are indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium treatment is desirable twice a year, especially for adults.
The main feature of the Caucasus Mineral Water region is, of course, therapeutic mineral sources: Slavanovsky, Smirnovsky, Escentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect the various systems of the body.
Water varies by temperature, number of salts, total mineralization, chemical composition and gas composition.
The doctor picks up water depending on the patient's health.
Thus, Narzan has an anti-inflammatory, immuno-modulative effect, restores gastrointestinal tract functions and the exchange of substances.
Essentuki-4 is affecting the gastrointestinal tract, reducing sugar levels.
Resentuki New has an inflammatory, gallant, and wetty effect.
The effects of Slavanovsky's water are the same.
The doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system when assigning water.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks up less salty water because salts hold the fluid, which leads to higher pressure.
The reception of mineral water requires moderation: water should be consumed at a certain time, quantity and temperature.
In the sanatoriums, various cosmetological procedures for the face and body are now available.
What types of healing, based on the natural characteristics of the North Caucasus, are available in the resorts of the region?
Near the Pigorsk, for example, there is the salted Lake Tambukan, which is used for joints, spine, and internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, dissipating, immunomodulating effect.
It's a healthy walk along individual routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is in close proximity to the Narzan mineral source.
There you can also take baths of wine, pearls, yovalents, seleniums, salvage lacry, depending on what you get assigned by a doctor.
Let's extend the fruitage.
What can we do to ensure that the crop reaches the end of the season?
It's told by Julia Belopukhov, an agronomist and a maid.
It's time for the tall tomatoes to do a haircut: remove the new stepchildren, cut the macs, remove all the leaves before the penultimate brush with the fruit and the blossoms with the small bandages, they'll never grow.
All tomatoes, irrespective of the “constitution”, as well as peppers and aubergines, are fed with sun-superphosphate extracting, biomedicines (Speaker - to accelerate the flow and growth of fruit, Phytosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamair, Baktofit - to prevent diseases, Immunocytophitis - to increase immunity, Bitoxybacillin, Lepidocide, Phytoverm - if there are pests).
At the end of the summer, chemicals are used only in copper, colloide sulphur, and green soap.
We're doing the last plant water.
The long braided cucumbers in the greenhouse are released from the wallpaper so that the lower, tanned part of the stem (25-40 cm) is laid on the ground, watered with warm water and Circon solution, and the stem of 5-7 cm compost is planted.
It is also easy to extend the fruitage of the courgette by cutting off old leaves, pouring warm water and a solution to complex fertilizers, and pouring fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against the cold of the night, install a chain of arc with concealed material over the ridge.
Keep the plants open during the day, and close after sundown.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s withdrawal from the longest recession in 20 years.
According to Bloomberg analysts, the GDP of the Russian Federation is showing a positive trend, with GDP falling by 0.8 per cent in annual terms in the second quarter.
This figure has been minimal since early 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, the Russian economy slowed down to 0.6 per cent in the second quarter.
Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development have also recently stated that the situation has stabilized.
Slow growth ahead.
According to CBD experts, the recession in the Russian economy has remained in the past.
“The index estimate of Russian GDP indicates that the recession is behind us and the slow growth of the economy ahead,” says the Bank of Russia’s bulletin “What Trends Say”.
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter has been increased to 0.4 per cent by regulators, and the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5 per cent.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter, the Russian Federation’s GDP declined in the second quarter, at 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared decline in GDP was 0.2 per cent by the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline stopped: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June the GDP change was between 0-0.15,” quotes the representative of the IER RIA "News".
The slowing down of the Russian economy over the last five quarters indicates that “the bottom has passed”.
Among other markers indicating signs of national economic recovery, Bloomberg refers to increased demand for electricity and rail transport, and business recovery.
If you adjust to the fact that the year is high, it is clear that the trend of plus 1% of electricity consumption can be partly due to the extra working day.
Add to this lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight traffic, but it's hard to get accurate data, and plus or minus 0.5% of the semi-annual volume can also be explained by seasonality,” explains Cyril Yakovenko of ALOR BORKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressures.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent, compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
Moreover, Rossstat has recorded deflation for the past two weeks.
Prices in Russia have fallen for the first time in five years.
If you look at the trend in the course of the ruble, which, while showing strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, the result of August has been 12% stronger since the beginning of the year.
This is also one of the signs of recovery that indicators from the real economy must follow,” Yakovenko emphasizes.
In addition, there has been an increase in industrial production in the Russian Federation since April.
In June, the figure increased by 1.7 per cent.
The decline in foreign trade has slowed from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The situation in the labour market, where the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.4 per cent, also shows positive developments.
The following was only in September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the question of the real disposable incomes of the population is not enough.
In annual terms, the figure decreases by 4.8 per cent.
This may hinder economic recovery, as household expenditures make a significant contribution to GDP.
Generally, their share in the structure of the economy is more than 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the hard policy of the Bank of Russia is also a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator holds the rate at 10.5 per cent, which does not have a better impact on the real sector.
Lack of investment, which hampers industrial capacity development, is also a negative factor.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year the decline in the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5 per cent versus -3.7 per cent in 2015,” says an analyst of the GK Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well developed in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, has not yet been so active in summer sports.
While the Rio Olympic Games favour Russia by former foreigners, most of them are from former Soviet republics.
In Rio, however, we can see the reverse, with a considerable number of Russians flying the flags of other States.
The history of change of nationality varies in each case.
Someone was taken to another country when they were kids without a choice.
Someone couldn't stand the competition for a seat in the Russian team.
And someone thought that abroad would create better conditions for development in sport.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of a 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa Red.
But she used to be Elizabeth, of course.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years later, once the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
That's where she decided to follow in her older sister's footsteps - a little athletic.
Like her sister, Lisa chose to jump from the sixth.
If she were to stay in Russia, she wouldn't have been able to move Elena Isinbaev off the throne.
Unfortunately, at the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be our only countryman, though ex, in the 6th jumping sector.
Its best achievements in this form of sport are the bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the continental first in 2016, which it won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
She was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious evangelical propagandists.
Because of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight other children were raised in the family.
They all lived in a small town in Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started getting into fighting when she was in high school.
With good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where she continued to study at the U.S. Training Centre under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izbojnikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost her first fight.
But at the World Cup that same year, it's a win.
Before that, by the way, she had won silver at the 2010 world premiere.
After that, it was bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
The 26-year-old Maria was born in Yaroslavla, where she first met synchronized swimming.
But it would be wrong to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Mary continued her classes.
She soon joined the U.S. team and showed excellent results at the Pan American Games.
Understandably, at a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but America’s record is the ceiling.
A new name, which sounds strange in Russian, was given to Christina Shaldibina at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue to teach the girl art gymnastics beyond the ocean.
Until then, the girl had a favorite sport in her home country, Jaroslavla.
After emigrating to the United States, she quickly joined the country's youth team and later entered the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
She didn't have to fight for the first positions on the world stage, but for the US, she's made a real breakthrough, leading a star-size team to the Rio Olympics.
Another of our former artists is Jan Berezko-Margrander, who's in favor of the German team.
Ian was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when she was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more prospects for joining the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 Olympics in London.
It's true that Jana was only able to take 17th place, not enough to get into the final competitions in her personal first place.
But two years earlier, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games, the youthful ones.
Another gymnast, just this time Irina Sazonova.
If the route of emigration of the previously mentioned athletes can be described as standard, the choice of Irina’s family is very unusual in Iceland.
Ira is a student of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland, she immediately became a champion of the country.
True, Ira is training in Russia - he comes to his home country specifically to keep his skills.
In Rio, she did not perform as well as she wanted.
The best place is 40 in a personal multi-fight.
There are very few reports of swimmer Maria Ugholkova in Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria has lived and trained in Switzerland.
However, for a long time it had been under the Russian flag, showing good results – even the country’s record of 200 meters of butterfly.
In 2015, she acquired Swiss citizenship and began flying a red-and-white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th place in the 4×100 integrated relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project that was able to raise some 6,000 francs, which enabled her to pay for the Olympics.
A 31-year-old freestyle fighter, Adam Batyrov, spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, Hasavurt's native became a three-time champion of European championships, a champion of Russia, and a master of Russian sports of the international class.
When he stopped joining our national team, it was time to think about a change of nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from sports posts.
A triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships - Batyrov already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and won a trip to the Rio Olympics.
There is another Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, who is even less known at home than Swiss swimmer Maria Ugholkov.
The fact is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
That's where Michael started gymnastics.
It has not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio, the best outcome was 40 seats in parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even being at the Olympic Games in gymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her training in synchronized swimming, showing good results at the national level.
In 2014, at the 2014 European Championship in Berlin, the girl was ranked 6th in synchronized navigation.
In a duo with Eugenia, Tetelbaum Anastasia took eighth place.
She was the fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitri Croiter supports Israel's team.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at 17 years of age, Dmitri became the champion of the country.
He won the World Youth Championship in the same year.
A year later, Croyter won the gold of the Singapore Junior Olympic Games.
In addition to high jumping, Dmitri jumps in length and triple jumps.
31-year-old Albert is another resident of Hasaurth, who, after a long campaign for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
Unlike Batyrov, however, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In the Russian Federation, he stood for the Krasnoyarsk School of Higher Sports, even becoming a champion of the country in 2011.
The 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow as a member of the USSR volleyball team, Jaroslav Antonov.
Just one year before his son was born, Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
That's where the family stayed.
In 2015, he became a bronze champion of the European championship in his new homeland.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and was born with his family in the middle of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get to this northern country -- to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn to fight freely.
Soon, he won the world's highest among juniors, and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the competition.
Once again, the free fight, and again the former Russian.
This time, we're talking about a native of North Ossetia who emigrated to Spain, Taimuraz Freeva.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and is currently in favour of his team.
Before that, it was true that a 30-year-old athlete had been successful in Russia as well.
He became the bronze prizer of the 2007 and 2008 championships.
The statute of non-entry, Timuraz decided to change his sports citizenship.
The last one on our list is a Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Mahachal, Arthur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took his family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
That's where Arthur started boxing on the advice of his older brother.
Since then, Arthur has been a champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he became a champion of the world among young people.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, son.
Why do kids need cossack classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Condratiyev, "the signs need to be brought up in a systematic manner, not by actions and parades."
They must grow up and understand from at least 7 years of age that they are Cossacks and education must be Cossacks.
But so far, I think this job is being formalized and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the cossack classes take over all the positives that they've built up before, at a qualitatively new level, I'd be happy to.
If everything's swollen and unfamiliar, the new idea will turn out to be cheap populism.
The LHC continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country ' s economy.
There is an intruder with funds allocated to the public sector from various levels of budgets.
According to the Attorney-General's Office, overpriced tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the area of LKK.
As a result, consumers in the region overpaid over 170 million roubles.
Recently, the Prosecutor ' s Office of Krasnodar province also found evidence of undue cost included in tariffs.
In addition, the cost of the EB Consulting (cold water) GLP was invested in 4 million roubles for the rental of vehicles at a price higher than the market price.
And there's a lot of such examples in the country.
According to the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94 per cent.
He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code: embezzlement, legalization of the proceeds of crime, abuse of power, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund who repaired the city, Makarov entered into contracts with businessmen, they were not actually performed but paid for.
Businessmen were just paying him back most of the money.
And as the owner of the PC, Makarov collected money from the population, but the service providers did not pay and spent it on their own.
As a result, millions of rubles are damaged by the budget and the occupants.
Macarova's scheme of fraud is, unfortunately, typical of Russia.
There has been a wave of arrests and detentions of heads of the Criminal Code who have embezzled money from citizens.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kohan is continuing, by the way, also by a former councillor accused of 91.7 million roubles of fraud.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013, in Elizovo Kamchatsk province, he established six management companies and created three limited liability societies.
One of them was engaged in contractual work for the CC, and the other two served as clearing centres, i.e. receiving money from the population.
However, the energy of A. Kohan did not allocate funds, but spent on himself, the one he loved.
It's quite difficult to sue the GKH area.
It doesn't start, it's slow.
And "helps" in this highly complicated housing law, Svetlana Razomnova, executive director of the NP "WHC Control."
We don't have time to make one law, as we come up with a new one that should make the previous one work.
There are also few specialists, including judges, in the area of VCS.
Lawyers themselves recognize that very little attention is given to housing law in higher education institutions.
Refusal to initiate criminal proceedings, and the investigation is also reported in the Attorney-General's Office.
Of the 3,500 crimes under trial in 2015, less than half had been brought to court.
The rest of the investigation took a long time and one in five was suspended due to the lack of identification of the accused.
Inadequacies in law enforcement are often attributed to gaps in existing legislation.
There is a law, but the investigating authorities are slow to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of forgery, with only 60 criminal cases brought.
In the five months of this year, the number increased only slightly, 99.
What is falsification of the minutes of the tenants' meeting?
This means that changing the management of the house, financial and other matters are circumventing the views of the owners.
It also means that the housing and public services market cannot be accessed by normal companies that want to work honestly, not to “cool” the population.
So the tenants are minus, the small and medium business, too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption per se throughout the State, Anton Jarkov, a member of the State Property Committee.
This work is now under way.
These are not just isolated actions; they are a deliberate course of action against corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, there's no scandal in the capital.
Why is there no such scandal in Moscow in the area of GKH as in many other regions?
Because the capital government has shown iron will and brought order, Anatoly Chosenny, a member of the State Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, told AIF.
I mean both human resources, legislative amendments, and legal education.
Managers are closely supervised and all have been licensed.
Citizens ' complaints are dealt with quickly in public space (and the addresses of residents and responses are posted on the Government of Moscow portal).
Many do not just pay monthly receipts, but follow closely what it says about the house.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and the obligations of resource and management organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow is testing the validity of housing and utilities tariffs, as a large part of the budget goes to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
It's probably all about the calm situation in Moscow together.
So it's all about the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe the willless should change their place of work.
Turkish gumbit.
Will Erdogan be able to give up his friendship with the EU and the US?
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey put forward an ultimatum for the US to choose between Turkey and Fathullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d'état.
He announced this in front of his supporters in Ankara.
Erdoğan called on Americans to abandon their support for the Fathullahist terrorist organization.
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the US calls for a change of position.
Experts believe that the divisions in Turkey’s relations with the West are increasing and may lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
“America will choose between Turkey and FETO sooner or later.”
Either the organizer of the FETO coups or the democratic Turkey.
She has to make this choice," quotes the Anatoly Agency's Erdoğan address on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but he has already made it harder for the United States to comply with his demand for the first time since the rebellion was suppressed.
On the night of 16 July, the Turkish Army made an attempt to overthrow legitimate authority in Turkey, as well as an attempt on the life of the Head of State.
However, after Regep Erdoğan addressed the population, the rebellion was suppressed and its organizers and participants were arrested.
In total, some 8,000 people were suspected, with teachers and scientists in addition to the military.
According to Regep Erdoğan, they were mentored by Fathullah Gülen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdoğan’s supporters also admitted that Americans could be directly involved in the coup d’état.
The Panel recommends compensation in the amount of US$25,000 for all claims against Gülen, refusing to issue Gülen and recommending that the tone be changed.
The last statement made by representatives of the State Department in this regard was made at the time of Erdogan's visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey from insisting on it and also making demands on his other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under a migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not set a date for the lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens”, announced the Turkish Minister for EU Affairs, Omer Čelik, on 9 August.
He said that the amendment of the anti-terrorist law by Ankara, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe’s own security.
Note that on 1 August, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the EU with promises to open borders to migrants in order to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His remarks responded to the relevant statement made by the head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mevlut Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement by Chavushoglu made last Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not rule out that the country would consider withdrawing from the alliance unless it received the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence sphere is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign states in the defence field - they import missiles," said Chavushoglu in an interview with Anadolu.
He said that Turkey now needed to establish its own defence system based on its technology, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
“Turkish has so far tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have begun to look for others,” said the Minister.
Experts believe that this is a sign of Turkey’s serious disagreement with the West and the country’s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Regep Erdoğan is now playing his game and cannot face a violent confrontation with the West.
He has a lot to do with the West both in terms of business and in terms of military (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think Erdoğan will try to balance by maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, it would be easier for Americans to see a fully obedient man in this post,” the expert explained Aif.ru.
He said that following statements by the Turkish leader (on the non-payment of EU compensation, the requirement of a visa-free space with Europe, and the surrender of Guillen from the United States) he might be under pressure.
"Rejep Erdoğan will face a deterioration in relations with America and the European Union, and they will pressure him on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of government, and so on," Minchenko says.
The head of the Centre for Political Information, Alexei Muhin, admits that the President of Turkey will change his point of view with Russia as soon as he wins.
Eight months ago Erdoğan took a very hard stance against Russia and sought favor in all ways in the West.
In a very short time, the situation has changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again after some time.
I think Erdoğan has entered shuttle diplomacy.
Having been between the two poles, the West and Russia, he will try to gain maximum benefit for himself,” Muhin believes.
In his view, the main challenge for the President of Turkey today is to retain political power in the country, and to that end he needs Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop the US from supporting Guelene.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, consensus will be reached with Turkey”, the expert considers.
Anna Glasova, head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East, has a different view.
Turkey’s relations with both the EU and the US are now tense enough, and this is primarily related to Erdoğan’s own domestic policy.
I think that this crisis will worsen in relations, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reset politics both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is not by accident that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, claim that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, settled relations with Israel, engaged actively with Iran,” explained Aif.ru Glasov, suggesting that Erdoğan’s next step would be to normalize relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy that Erdoğan is currently pursuing is a return to the foreign policy approach followed by Turkey prior to the Arab revolution.
“It was at that time that Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in terms of zero problems with its neighbours.
The visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and Africa have now been very successful.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and strengthen Turkey's position on both the regional and international fronts,” the expert considers.
The eye believes that Turkey’s return to its former relationship with the EU will be incredibly difficult, and the question now is whether the EU will begin to respond harshly to Turkey, which can open borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Paramedics strike: Calling for new collective protests
Representatives of the junior doctors asked the trade union to approve new collective protests in their dispute over a new contract of employment.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Medical Assistants' Committee (JDC) is about to ask its full council to support more collective protests from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers were unable to answer questions about the employment contract.
The junior doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel the contract of employment agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members voting by secret ballot.
In a letter to members published on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC president Helen McCord said that the government continued to “strongly silence” about the problems she said had led to the rejection of the contract.
She said, "Bearing in mind the current situation, the JDC leader voted in favour of rejecting the proposed new employment contract in its entirety and called for formal renegotiations on all your issues."
In response to the government's silence, JDC leader today made a formal request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a continuous programme of expansion of collective protests starting early September.
The dispute led to the participation of young doctors in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the Public Health Service.
BMA's associate doctor, Dr. Joan Malawana, resigned after voting for the cancellation of the agreed terms of employment, which BMA recommended.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one to be accepted during the meetings leading up to the voting of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Secretary of Health Jeremy Hunt said that this employment contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "The Bad Alliance"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden palace hall in St. Petersburg, I had the strong impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile seemed strained, and he hardly emitted warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on the other hand, has repeatedly referred to his dear friend, Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdoğan's actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm meant the opposite.
But the tightening coolness from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first one he mentioned in the introductory remarks: Turkey hit a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was violent.
Mr. Putin broke out with an angry tirade, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger, based on an alleged friend.
The restoration of real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a staggering, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks should be blamed for everything.
The most serious were the accusations made by senior officials that Mr. Erdoğan's own family had profited from the illegal trade in oil from Syrian zones controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it with determination.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdoğan.
Russia could claim a victory of some kind.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdoğan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost thrown off his post last month in an attempted coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him, too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number dropped sharply by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly feel relieved when the flights finally resume.
They're at the peak of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
Even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Tourists in there, tomatoes back here," as the report in the Vedomy newspaper said.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what she considers to be a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to that her prolonged dissatisfaction with the pace of talking about joining the EU and Mr. Putin’s move to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroy Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for support for elected authorities after an attempted coup d’état.
Bear in mind that this is a gift for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So, the summit at this brilliant palace on the coast of the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as the “allanx of the bad”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West unite forces.
However, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
Perhaps speaks for itself that after almost three hours of initial talks, while the two Presidents gave a press conference, they did not even touch on the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common ground in Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and given the possibility of a complete catastrophe when a member of NATO was hit by a Russian jet fighter — it is better that the two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland.
Brand RBS should be reduced to a back office, according to the bank's executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has withdrawn from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During this period, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
He was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship for international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to the champion Wimbledon Andy Murray.
But it has now been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the banking of private individuals that will gain greater influence – Cutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview on a tour of clients and employees in Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland, "Brand RBS will eventually become our investment brand and the one that our staff will be engaged in, because we are now becoming more a brand bank."
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in its own population groups, and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is building a profile of different brands in sports sponsorship.
"This is the right time for us to move the brand bank, because the basis (we were asking ourselves) is how we focus on improving the customer bank?" said the executive director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we did, focusing on the needs of our clients, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can get those brands back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with a victory in New Market at Priestia.
Dettori sprinkles champagne after a take in New Market leads him to 3,000 victories.
Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th British victory in New Market on Friday.
He came to this remarkable mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track, on the Priestia trained by John Staten.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who has reached this remarkable mark in smooth races.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Iddie and Willie Carson.
Three-time jockey champion Dettory, who had previously won the Guyar, said, "This is something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I'm really glad it happened in New Market, because that's where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big social event, it's not Royal Ascot -- it's a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free of business and very unattractive.
Dettoria accepts applause when it brings predestination after victory.
Two jockeys reached this point in the race with obstacles: the jockey champion Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 wins in a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time winner of Derby, 4493 career wins.
Frankie is one of the finest jockeys of the modern era, and it is not surprising that he has reached that mark, which so few have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical smartness that distinguishes him from the others in the weight room.
He's a great race rep, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom, he'd bring 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend jockey and a big race!
And seriously, Frankie brought the winners to Britain for most of 30 years, which is good to see.
He's an energetic character, which is good for British races, but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettory celebrated this remarkable mark with a brand-new fast jump on the horse.
From the rapid finishes to the rapid spikes, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of the British smooth leaps for two decades.
It was ups and downs.
Many of the winners of the big race, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was disqualified because of doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge skeptics and get back into shape.
And he may not have finished for a while, and Dettory said earlier that he would like to continue to compete until at least 50 years of age.
Putin fires Chief of Administration Sergei Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusting neighborhood for many years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed a representative for environment and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin “determined to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the President,” but did not give a reason.
Deputy Mr. Ivanova has been appointed successor to him since 2012, Anton Vineaux.
Mr. Vineaux, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
He was later the head of the Office of the President's Protocol and the Government's Office, reporting the Kremlin's website (in Russian).
At the time of his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your work as head of State in drafting laws and in monitoring how your instructions are being implemented.
Putin informed a Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked for his release and recommended that Vineo replace him.
Are the smiles convincing?
It's a move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet Security Service, the KGB.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on State television, both men stated that the head of administration had resigned on his own accord.
But despite the smiles on the camera, few people were convinced here — especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unintended consequences of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement — that the man who was once agitated as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russian environmental policy — was met with huge scepticism.
In Putin’s comments quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said: “It is true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to entrust me with this very difficult position, even a problem post, for four years.
Well, it turns out I was president's chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could have become Russian President after Putin’s second term, since Putin’s third term would have been contrary to the Constitution.
However, this post was occupied by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister until his return to the presidency only three and a half years later.
"Thomas Gibson is fired after a fight with a producer.
Gibson was a part of a show fight in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint application.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences in the shoots and differences of opinion.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's character will be erased from a show that follows a team of FBI agents is expected to arrive later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
A 54-year-old actor who used to play a leading role in Darma and Greg's sitcom was on the show from the first season in 2005.
"I love thinking like a criminal" and I've put my heart and soul in it for the last 12 years," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but now it's impossible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our great team, and, most importantly, the best fans the show could ever dream of.
The show's supposed to come back with its 12th season on September 28.
Mystery: The fish landed in the garden of Banfa
A man from Banfa sought help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bane believes that 75 fish might have been sandstones left behind by a water tornado.
Bane, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted a picture of this spectacle in Pariskop in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
The Bridge is now connected to Fife.
The 1.35 billion pounds project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers connected the north and the Queensferry Crossing Viadic, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four links between the canvas verers, which are now approaching completion near all three pilons of the bridge.
The Fife Bridge section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 vants of bridge.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economy, Keith Brown, visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering art on a truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete were used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the link between the Viaduk and the bridge canvas is a virtual operation using extremely accurate assembly tolerances.
A total of about 79% of the entire bridge canvas is now in place, and for the last section of the linen, concrete is poured out in Rosite today, which means that all of the canvas is ready to climb to the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said, "The first link on each bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this convergence represents the most modern construction art.
After installing the last section of the road painting and linking it to the expanding roadwork of the Northern Pilon, we were left to close the remaining gap on the north side — or the side to the shore.
This was done by pulling the viaduk of the northern approach 700 millimetres southward.
It was a massive but very elegant operation.
Large, because the video is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and was supposed to be raised to about 3% inclination.
Fine because the tolerances the team was working on were tiny -- just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, all of this went very well.
Saved in the Gulf of Moelfr: Three men's luck to stay alive
Three men were lucky to stay alive after they were thrown off a fishing boat in Anglesi.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised an alarm at 1:20 p.m. on British summer time on Friday, after the crew saw an incident unfolding in the Gulf of Moelfr.
Three men tried hard to reach a safe place, while their boat continued to sail.
"We saw their ship spinning next to them and assuming the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happily, by the time we went down to the water, a strong wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man aged 60 was found exhausted and caught in a buoy without a lifejacket.
All of them were boarded by a coastal lifeboat and taken to a rescue station.
Jones said, "Three men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely intact.
The engine had an emergency disconnector, but somehow it got off the man driving the boat when it rolled over.
Someone was protecting these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It's exciting to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, preferring to spend their free time watching screens, has been a complaint to many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go pulls people away from the couch and engages them in some physical activity.
The screen's time was initially limited to television, video games, and recently smartphones.
It's so good to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the total fascination that Pokémon Go is, an app based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (which eventually produced a series of cartoons, play cards, and other branches).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomena, all of this became irrelevant a little earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed at that time due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter did in the days.
So how does it work?
In short, the smartphone players are looking for the Pokemons, which are tracked by GPS and, if found, can be photographed (through a screenshot on your phone) or caught.
The generation that played the game as a younger generation joined the prowl, breaking off the search sofas.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by a “normal” person on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people tracked by them, who performed 30 minutes of exercise every day, jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary level data.
Many health campaigns that persuade people to find 30 minutes, get off the couch, and be active every day have not found a response, because most health messages are boring and are spoken out by people who look unhappy.
Nevertheless, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high arterial pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it brings people out to do what they love.
Thus, three health bases are covered: movement, fresh air, and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring nerds who are looking for something to complain about.
And, yes, someone might run into the door.
So what?
There's been a breach.
Because even though smartphone apps like Fitbit might have been able to track our physical activity before, they didn't give us a reason to study, as this game does.
The news will sit down, and the use will weaken over time.
But because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to hunt more, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Bailes wins the gold of absolute primacy in female gymnastics.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the fuss.
Simone Bailes is invincible for all of this.
Dynamic on the team jump.
Unforced on a log.
It's stunning on the floor.
Fascinating everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic Champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast came up to the title of absolute championship on Thursday, placing the gap between herself and the rest of the world in a convincing demonstration under close Olympic attention.
Her total score of 62.198 was far enough from the silver medalist and teammate Eli Reisman and the Russian bronze medalist Alija Mustafina.
Byles from the United States performs on the gymnastic log during the final final of the female individual absolute first in artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bayles became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the championship of absolute first and fifth in general, establishing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She cried when her final score was shown and her long journey was over by now.
This achievement puts her in the same league as the extremely rare athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who raised their sports to new heights:
Byles has spent the last three years dominant in her sport, winning 15 medals at the World Cup -- including 10 gold medals -- with such staggering programs in their mix of hard work and precision that the 1984 Olympic Champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test was in Brazil, a competition not so much between Bailes and the others in this field, but between her and the cargo of high expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's house in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be considered an unfulfilled expectation.
Simone Bayles from the United States, on the left, and Eli Reisman are hugging after winning gold and silver, respectively, in the final of the female individual absolute first artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Byles earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for a retiring national team coordinator, Martha Karoli.
While Bayles insisted that she never looked into the future on her long journey to the top, that's not exactly true.
Part of her free exercise program, which includes her special passage, is installed on Latin American music, which would go right outside of the Olympic Arena Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was adopted by her grandparents as a child and opened up to Coach Aimee Burman’s mother during her visit to the gym where Burman was a coach became a force.
She hasn't lost a single absolute championship competition since the summer of 2013, a lucky lane that should last as long as Bayles wants.
Although Mustafina had a small advantage with two rotations, it was a mirage.
The hymn log and the free exercise — where Bailes defends the championship of the world — are ambushed.
She went forward again with 15.433 on the log and finished with 15.933 on the floor.
Reisman hugged her gently while they were waiting for the final score -- a pure formality -- and tears appeared around a brilliant red and blue eyeliner for the eyes of Bailes, when the design that she once recorded on the clipping album came true.
Reisman's speech was a little revenge for what happened four years ago, when she shared third place, but lost Mustafina's bronze on the Tai Break.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of a team that Americans call "Grandmother" was far ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise covered by the return, which sometimes seemed in question.
As for Bayles, a 19-year-old viral tweet from the beginning of this week now has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in the serial killer case were shot while listening to music in the car.
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the most deadly attack in the first serial killer of Phoenix in the last decade were sitting in the car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot dead on 12 June when their car was parked on the roadway, and the authorities announced.
The perpetrator fired approximately eight shots from a gun standing on the passenger side of the vehicle, after which he fled on another vehicle, and the report reported.
The police claim that a triple homicide does not appear to be the result of a robbery because the intruder did not take the wallet or $2,900 that was at the disposal of one of the adult victims.
The Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, stated that the shooting had prompted the investigators to check whether he had been involved in the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas for four months.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, the CBS branch, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW in the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, aged 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shelling, which was aimed at an empty pick-up half an hour before the triple murder and was believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
The investigators found the casings and recovered the bullet from the seat and the fragments of the bullet from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old child with microcephalus: "It's getting better."
Like most six - year - olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys, and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of her peers, Edmund has microcephalus as a result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pixivto did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not really true -- of course you're signing up for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized hospital.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing this," Pixivto explained.
Edmund walks with walkers.
Edmund didn't sit and crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But it's slowly going through some stages.
He walks with outside help and rides a bicycle.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture Edmund made for "please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," said Pixivto CBS News.
But not just the usual sign language, she says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephalus can arise from a variety of different circumstances: genetic infections during pregnancy from such viruses as measles and Zeke, such as Edmund.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary significantly.
It is too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zeke virus.
Piksivto remembers emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
Did I keep telling you what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifetime forecast because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Pixivto has some encouraging advice for the mothers of babies with congenital defects due to Zeke.
It's getting better.
You know everything's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding causes rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state through Saturday.
Numerous rivers in south-east Louisiana and south Mississippi have come out of the coast and threaten large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, reported the National Meteorological Service.
Governor John Bell Edwards of Louisiana stated that government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance had already gone to affected parishes.
Mike Steele, the Governor's Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, stated that requests were being made for high water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said it was only the parish of Tanjipahoa that asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
Flood risks remain until Saturday in much of the south of Louisiana.
The weather service said in the statement that an extra three to five inches could slide into the area.
In southern Alabama, waiting for flooding was until Friday, as it continued to rain in the area of Mobile.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amit River near Denem Springs, both in Louisiana, were projected to set a record of flooding during the past weekend.
Sinoptic Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could have flooded many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flood going downstream in the Assenchen parish was a threat, as these rising rivers would slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of Mississippi's border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday morning.
Squads were still pulling people out of flooding in Amit and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stiefson were among the rescued early on Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62 years old, says the Beaver Creek waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his house, quickly climbed overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up, and the water kept coming," Hansford said.
She's reached my belt level.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest tributary she'd seen in 48 years that she'd lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family had a disability, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers rescued all three with an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann says that the flood is spreading rapidly, as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Crowtmann says that an observer near Livingstone reported a rainfall of 13.75 inches from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was overwhelmed with rain from Wednesday.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets led to the rescue of residents from their homes in the parish of Tanjipahoa and the abolition of classes in five school districts, according to the authorities.
WWL, the CBS branch, reports that counsellor Tanjipahoa spoke about 200 houses flooded.
Residents have been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooding.
The parish president, Robbie Miller, stated that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets in high water.
Shelters were opened in the city of Amit and Hammond to accommodate those who were evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water begins to retreat," he said.
In the town of Hammond, about two dozen streets were closed because of high water levels, and sand bags were available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said the city manager Lacey Landrum.
It's on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Services, Rupert Lacey, reported that it continued to rain on the Gulf coast.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, manager of the Shopper Value Foods store in Amit, lives in this neighborhood for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Tauson, "and it's still pouring on the ground."
Mahage Brown, 6, "cut off by bullets," remains alive after the shooting in Philadelphia.
The police report that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
His grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
Grandma and grandpa say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He's been hit hard, his little body's been razed with bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melendez at the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to the first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of the four people shot in the Jermantown quarter.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were registered in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car near a 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting to the station.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Investigators report to the CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been an exchange of fire between several armed men.
Semi-automatic casings, attributed to different copies of semi-automatic weapons, have taken place.
Looks like it was definitely a long fight.
There were casings on the street, on both sides of the pavement.
So apparently there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting,” reported Philly Police Captain Anthony Ginaaldi.
Many homes and cars in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and the police are reportedly looking at surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was hit in the hand by a stray bullet on Tuesday when he played in front of his home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
That's what I call the women's Olympic team for gymnastics this year and for several reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly, three gymnastics play a key role in this team: Simona Bayles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernández, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
It also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, female gymnast number one has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
It's powerful.
At Gabby Douglas's last Olympics, she was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America applauded.
Now, the world could have witnessed incredible three-time World Champion Simone Bayles, Douglas and Lori Hernández performing unexpected but yet virtual gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in the female individual absolute first.
And Ali Reisman's teammate earned silver.
We're witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn't look like this in gymnastic sections all over the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They're the final five, because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnastics on the team, and this is the last year of Martha Karoli's coaching.
But in reality, gymnastics are expensive sports, and gymnastics are first trained in private gymnastic clubs supported by parents who pay the cost of schooling, equipment, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasiums and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their training, and this is a costly and long-term obligation for gymnast families.
Aimee Burman, coach Simone Bayles, and Maggie Hani, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes from the moment they started gymnastics.
We must create more affordable and accessible gymnastic training for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnastic foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (mainly blacks and Latin Americans) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Hymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resilience to exhausting work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a life-long positive impact on good health, school success, and work.
It's the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to gymnastics, and that's great.
Sport is so important, especially for girls.
This is such a great time.
Thank you, Simone, Ali, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Force in winning team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
The junior doctors took up the announcement of further strikes after Jeremy Hunt's offer was rejected.
The Ministers hoped to conclude the change dispute by agreeing to a modified agreement with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who voted rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the treaty, saying that NHS was on no land, and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes night work changes and weekends to improve out-of-school services.
Dr. Helen McCott, chairman of the BMA Young Doctors' Committee, said last night in a statement, "The junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it feeds on the existing labour crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly."
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors are transferred to a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
The attempt by the IMA to resolve the dispute in the negotiations was met by a reluctance to act and, at times, a complete silence on the part of the Government.
And that despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the concerns of the junior doctors.
If he does not do so, then the younger doctors are certain that they are ready to organize subsequent strikes.
The last strike, at the end of April, delayed some 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses, while nurses and consultants were hired to replace doctors on the picket line.
The Ministers hoped to end the change dispute by agreeing to a modified agreement with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
IMA wants to pay better for the 54,000 junior doctors who will fall under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged the junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer stated: “The strikes reach little or nothing, but exert pressure on the already-exploited teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorder to patients, nurses and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Doctors and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
The workers hoped that the continued positive assistance on other important topics — such as staff distribution, flexibility of learning, additional training for those returning after career breaks, cost of learning, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay differences in medicine — was a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about to meet the conditions reached by the WMA in November, February and May.
A 2-per-day drug could reduce the risk of a heart attack.
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to use a 2-per-day drug after the authorities have recommended giving it to more people for a longer time.
The antidote ticgrelorom reduces the risk of relapses for people with heart disease.
The drug is already assigned 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
NICE’s National Health Service has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, NICE’s National Health Service has advised people to give it to them for four years to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs every year to about 140,000 people in England, and a quarter of them have another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes result from the accumulation of fat on the walls of the arteries and the formation of placards.
If the plaque is torn apart, it can cause a clot that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can move through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already experienced one attack are at greater risk of having another.
Tikagrlor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold as Brilique, reduces the risk by making the clots less likely.
The NICE draft instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg ticgrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said, "Despite the existence of effective secondary prevention methods with about a quarter of the people who have already had a heart attack, there is another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
There is evidence that ticgrlorine, combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
While recommending a ticgrelor, we are happy to be able to increase the treatment available to the many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the efficiency and safety of ticgrlor, especially the risk of bleeding, is limited at the end of three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment longer than that period.
The culture of PC ownership allows for the falsification of votes in Muslim districts to flourish
Ex-Mair Tower Hamlets Lutfour Rahman was suspended last year because of corruption, serving as a trigger for the Government's report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the closing of eyes, which has resulted in the widespread falsification of votes in Muslim communities, according to information from the destructive government report released today.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Erik Pickles is critiqued by the police, election observers and city administrations for ignoring evidence of electoral irregularities because of “excessive sensitivity to race and religion”.
The former secretary of local communities, now the anti-corruption king, reported that the intimidation of religiously motivated voters was so strong that the police needed to be allowed to place borders outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
For the time being, voters should simply indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests that ink should be applied to the fingers of the people when they deliver their ballot papers, so that someone can vote twice.
Better protection needs to be provided to informants, Sir Eric said.
It calls for greater press access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of a voting scandal in Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the current Mayor of Luftour Rahman should have been removed from office because of a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, as he was said, “went his campaign on the basis that Muslim believers were obliged to vote for him”.
Up to 300 votes were doubtful or the result of a person voting, pretending to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about mail fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community were reported to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, in the photograph, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including requiring you to bring your identity card to prove who you are.
His report states: “Provided evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote at the will of older persons, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"There were fears that... public institutions had closed their eyes to such behaviour because of the excessive sensitivity of `political correctness' to ethnicity and religion."
Cheese Erik made 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the removal of political activists from working on the postal ballots to stop the “vote harvest”.
The report before Teresa May also calls for tighter registration checks to prevent the use of the voters ' list for immigration fraud and privileges.
Consideration is being given to requiring voters to produce an identity card before voting.
Use ink on people's fingers as soon as they drop their bulletin to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on the nationality of people to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on applications for automatic postal voting.
To suspend campaign politicians and activists from working with completed absentee ballots and postal envelopes.
To give the police the power to establish boundaries around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation, as presented in the 1983 People ' s Act.
Make illegal photography at polling stations.
Require only English to be used at polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that the staff force voters to go to the booth one by one.
Sir Erik is violently attacking the city police, claiming that this is “surprising” that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
“The election court disqualified Lutfour Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and unlawful acts”, he reported.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt — the criminal standard of proof — on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the inconclusive “checks” of the electoral offices of city administrations.
Sir Eric stated, "The previous court order in the Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some organs threaten this good reputation.
Crazy like Kate and other Olympic celebrities in Rio.
The fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy about the French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prevo, who has turned out to be very similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic player is far from the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who can boast of her own famous doppelganger — at least, according to social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrities that appear on our screens at this time, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympics with more than a superficial resemblance to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and wolf: Member of the U.S. male archer team Brady Allison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to Kate's bicycle double, many people online rushed to point out how a certain archer could be a twin of Leonardo DiCaprio's superstar.
A member of the U.S. male archer team, Brady Ellison, caused a hurricane on Twitter after images of it appeared, looking frighteningly like a Wall Street Wolf star.
And in fact, the archer found out about social media madness and admitted that he heard that he's been like Leo since he was a kid.
"I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe except for the vegetation on the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt be even more marked this year: the striking similarity between British jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Alia Mustafina, with her great, expressive eyes, is said to be an exact copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burg, Matthew Morrison has been compared to Glee Club star for many years.
Moving on to the more unexpected: This user thinks Nathan is the "sport version" of the actor "Start"
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who could boast of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
A silver medalist from Russia, Julius Efimov, can boast not only of tanned skin and blond hair like an actress Anna Lynn McCord, but Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, according to fans, is like a "sport version of Joseph Gorgon Levitte".
Solo football star, on the left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, have the same faces and eyes.
Not the only one: one Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities.
By creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason why this couple looks similar.
One Twitter user recently approached the site to make public his admiration that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
Indeed, United States football star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar faces and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of the actress Laura Lynnie, as well as the gold medal winner, Gabby Douglas, who can boast of her own beautiful broad smile, which is like the smile of the star "Main Success" Gabrielle Union.
The CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying "dead as a pig" about a Chinese swimmer.
Byron McDonald's analysis of the fourth place on the finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan on the 4x200 m freestyle women's estafete has resented CBC viewers on a live broadcast of the Olympics.
The Canadian CBC broadcaster was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started like a smell" and "dead as a pig" during the swim.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final women's 4x200 m free style.
You could hear McDonald, who was drawn to the CBC commentators team to "feel her color," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Too excited, started like a stench, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, aged 14, sailed through the second phase of the 1 1:57.79 relay by 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rake, allowing Canadians to clear the gap from China.
Around Canada, audiences quickly reacted online after they were shocked by the tone and expressions used.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC spokesman just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "dead like a pig"??"
That idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
About Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the 4x200 m women's relay, they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Twitter critic immediately struck Byron McDonald, and many urged him to fire.
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Great #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who broadcast CBC, apologized live for McDonald's comment, saying, "We're sorry for the comment on the swim performance on the air."
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
IFOR concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response
A friend of commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of McDonald.
CBC then copied and sent their apology to over 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments.
The network also rushed to apologize and publish the statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologize to our audiences live and our followers on social media.
Let's be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not about her as a person.
Still, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron deeply regrets what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying that he did not think his words would be interpreted as an attack on a person.
'I'd like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on the CBC Olympics.
'I was talking about the swimmer's performance, not about her personally.'
'It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I'm sorry.'
Primark's buyer insulted a woman who shyly tried on her underwear in the middle of the store.
The buyers didn't know where to look when some woman was naked to try on her panties, on the floor with the shops in the middle of Primark.
Worse still, she tried on how she looked in them, pulled them off, and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear at the Bowery Place mall in Faulxton.
The Primark store of the Bowery Place mall in Faulxton, where a woman used to try on her tricidary panties before putting them back on the shelf.
The mother of the two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said that after the underwear fitting, the mystery woman again "dressed and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the mall, she took a pair of panties from the window, took off her own panties and panties and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a safe place to do it -- she just stood there, shameless."
"Everybody was staring when she took off her panties again, and she clearly didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing with the other three couples before she finally decided that there was nothing here that she liked, dressed and left again.
"It doesn't look like she cared who was watching her, "or what she thought about the person who would eventually buy those panties she was trying on."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent said, "It's disgusting to think that someone's going to take home the panties that someone else already wore, and they weren't washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these clothes from the market after she left, and the better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new pair of women's underwear and find out what another woman was wearing and taking them off, and they weren't washed."
A representative of Primark said, "Primark knows about the incident that happened at our shop in Faulxton on Tuesday, 9 August."
All the goods in question have been removed from the market.
How to protect yourself from assaults with a gun using a Krav Maga.
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Misrachi, the master of the Crava Maga Federation in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether they approach you from the front or the back, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own weapon.
If they come from behind, according to Misrachi, the first thing you need to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and "free the line of fire."
Then you tighten the gun between your forearm and shoulder before you hit them in the face with a free elbow.
Then your knee goes in the groin, and as the attacker bends away from the pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with a gun, and back off, holding the gun pointed at him.
For an armed, right front, the same way of doing it is to take your body off the line of fire, grab the gun quickly and twist it so that the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip before you step back and aim at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video to see how Misrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery -- if you're not a Krav Maga Master -- is to give your cash back.
For a guide, traveler Jan Wright spends his tongue in the most filthy places in Europe
A British traveler tested his immune system and vomit reflex seriously, licking some of the most filthy and disgusting places in Europe.
The lead and author of travel books, Jan Wright, 51, from Suffolk, spent his language on the euro banknote, the Circa Piccadili railroad, the toilet flush button on the train and the Russian public phone to prove the power of his immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is supposed to be a film called "The Guide of the Traveler-Lizoon on the Inner Power," has produced some amazing results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of others may be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and health workers about the increase in intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, nothing licked brought him more than bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for testing his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public railings at the train stations to the toilet flush button, this task certainly experienced his immune system.
In the film he made, he said, "I've been completely careless of my health since I was a child, and I've dragged a lot of things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test swab showed a luminometer value exceeding 4,000 units.
By comparison, just washed hands must be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after his luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while the newly washed hands show less than 60
Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio made a film about a traveler called "Trainer-Lizoon Guide on the Inner Power", which shows the number of bacteria in different places, for example in the toilet.
In the film, he said, "It's close to one of the worst things I've ever sniffed in the bathroom."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The "Lizuna Traveler's Guide to the Inner Power" was taken off with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains acidic bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestinal bacteria and to develop the immune system.
Senior Vice President Valio for snacks, juices and new categories, Nico Wuorenmaa said, 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be interesting to see and at the same time explain the benefits of the probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended up with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health, and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the director of the film, added, "Let's say I'd lose my respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, some things were easier for Jan to lick, and some were pretty tough.
I'm glad we've been able to film some of these licks.
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 per cent of respondents linked acid bacteria exclusively to good stomach and intestinal conditions, while 58 per cent said that they used at least occasionally products containing added acidic bacteria.
A family of bullies destroyed Saltash, the city house of Cornwall, the day before the eviction.
The hooligans' family left their municipality house with a $50,000 loss after being evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilcock, were kicked out of their real estate in Saltas, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from a real estate facility, shocking housing cooperative officials discovered the real estate site in a condition requiring repair.
The walls were left with shining holes, the floors were opened, the garbage was scattered across the floor and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family is now resettled and is supposed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McAvoy, the dispersal at Cornwall House, said she was afraid he couldn't be saved.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are a lot of things that need to be weighed, because this property is probably known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys bad fame, and their name has bad fame.
A couple of three sons who lived in a real estate facility from time to time, and the police report that the kingdom of the horror caused by the family included battling in the street, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive shouting, controversy and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got a warrant for antisocial behavior in June.
In a few rooms at the house that could be made, they found old trash.
The floorboards in the house that used to sell drugs were pulled off.
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and called the police regularly.
Cornwall Houseing forcibly evicted her and her partner this week, after having been granted an extended period of 11 weeks to leave voluntarily.
The eviction was welcomed with relief by the neighbors, who said that their lives had been transformed into a living hell.
One said, "They didn't care."
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
'This morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of Cornwall Houseing, said that the family was unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and regularly called the police
The trash and the old toys were scattered down the bottom of the municipal house.
He added, "It's a shame that the tenant couldn't take any responsibility for her and her family's behavior, because eviction is always the last method to be considered by Cornwall Houseing.
It was a very difficult case, because behavior was limitable, and their actions must have been horrifying to her observant neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done to give us information.
I hope that this development will give a little comfort to the neighbours and send a message that associative behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all a little over 20.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage surrounding the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, as well as weights, supplies and $1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after he pleaded guilty to possession of Class B drugs for delivery.
She claimed that the money went to pay for the tomb for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were rendered homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms in the house were covered with graffiti all over the surface.
The police say they'll try to evict tenants who don't comply with the rent rules.
Angela Crowe, of Devon and Cornwall's police, stated that this eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
'It's a message for those who feel they can behave without being charged by the prosecutor, as well as those who are harmed by this behavior,' she said.
Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a low-flying military plane almost touched the beach.
In the city of Aveira in Portugal, tourists who love the sun were terrified for their lives.
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion flew incredibly low
The Air Force reported that he was on a training flight but insisted that there was no risk to safety
This is the moment when frightened tourists start to panic, while the moment when a low-flying plane spiked over an overcrowded beach.
Dramatic images show a military aircraft flying almost at a distance from hunters on a sand strip to Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The resters jumped on their feet as they became understandably concerned with the noise of the aircraft’s engines but were unable to see that they were moving through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the city of Aveira in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who posted a shocking social media video, said, "He flew very low twice, and there was a moment, at some point it seemed to break."
Nono Arroga added, "I was surfing and I swear, it felt like the plane was about to fall on me."
Tourists on Aveira Beach were horribly frightened when the plane appeared from the fog and flew at extremely low altitudes.
The Portuguese Air Force stated today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast, and was forced to descend so low, as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot stated that the aircraft had flown a little lower than usual due to the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal and claimed the lives of four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force today made a statement that the pilot had to fly so low because of the circumstances of the thick fog and the smog from the forest fires, which made the appearance worse.
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was instructed to detect fishing boats as part of the mission
The HASSP system has been compulsory for over a year, but most restaurants and restaurants in Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Inspections are increasing, and the business faces fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Criminal Control Points system (HACCP, in the Russian version of HACCP), a risk analysis and critical control points, is mandatory for food producers and carriers, as well as general catering companies in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
Rostpresnadzor's business checks for compliance with these standards began in Petersburg in February 2015.
In the meantime, however, officials only issue fines for certain violations of the rules (see “List of documents” ...).
A total of 600,000 roubles for the first offence and 1 million roubles for the second would be required to fail to comply with the regulations.
The HASSP, as a system that takes into account and prevents food risks, came up in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about the safety of food for astronauts.
The system is now being used in all food plants not only in the US, but also in Canada and the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating in TC.
Business had four years to develop and implement the system (the HASSP requirement appeared in the TC Regulation in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this rule.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the norm applies only to food production, not to restauranters, as explained by the head of the Public Council, Elena Ceretéli.
Now everyone's trying to catch up.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is the end of August and the beginning of September.
But they won't call for a big demand, because their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, and experts note.
The Alliance of Tourism Agencies sent a letter yesterday to the Government asking for charters now.
“For many Russian tourists, the question of the selection of quality and accessible seafaring is insurmountable, as most of the accommodation facilities have already been booked before the end of September in the resorts of Krasnodar province and the Republic of Crimea”, the authors note, and stress that the opening of charter services in August will not significantly affect the already existing demand for Russian seaborne tourism products.
As reported at the Northwest Regional Office of the Russian Touring Union (RTU), in the event that Russian and Turkish aviation agencies agree quickly, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding, when the charters are resumed, until now, depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes can fly in September, even August, if the tour operators quickly set up programmes and arrange with airlines for the aircraft to fly,” says Pavel Rumentsev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects, Northwest RST Regional Office.
According to him, a possible renewal of the charters is good news, but it will not have a great impact on market power, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from rest and are preparing for school or taking vacations in other countries.
During the velvet season, travelers and couples mostly buy tours.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously,” says Pavel Rumeensev.
"Turkish has a chance to attract a lot of tourists, if it's now going to give very budget offers -- 50,000 to 60,000 roubles per tour for two, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, Director General of Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, it's definitely not worth counting on, because most of the trips are planned.
Paul Rumentsev also believes that since there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be required, but there is no reason to wait.
"For Turkey, the launch of charters now is the next season's rehearsal," says Pavel Rumentsev.
"The opening of charters to Turkey is good news for the next season," says Valeria Rubtsov.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from the NPFL of statutory compensation payments within the limits of the approved rules relating to compensation for injury caused by injury or other damage to health.
The granting of milk to workers working in harmful working conditions is provided for under article 222 of the Criminal Code.
On the other hand, the rules and conditions for extradition are established by order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation of 16 February 2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, the free distribution of milk or other equivalent foodstuffs is made to workers on days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions resulting from harmful production factors in the workplace.
On the basis of the above-mentioned rules, the Russian FNL concluded in the letter that, on the basis of article 217, paragraph 2, paragraph 3, of the NCRF, incomes in the form of the cost of milk paid to employees on days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions are exempt from the imposition of an order of 16 February 2009 No. 45n by the Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation.
The Moscow Gastrobank has not been licensed by the CB.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked its banking licence from a credit organization, the GASSTROYBANK Commercial Bank, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, GASSTROYBANK AKB had a high-risk credit policy relating to the placement of money in low-quality assets.
An adequate risk assessment at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank ' s assets have given the credit organization grounds for preventing bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in questionable transit operations.
The bank has a provisional administration until the date of appointment to the competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization under federal laws have been suspended.
AKB GASSTROYBANK is a member of the deposit insurance system.
It should be recalled that the payment of insurance compensation to bank investors, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Act No. 177-FZ “On the insurance of natural persons' deposits in banks of the Russian Federation”, is provided for in the amount of 100 per cent of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million roubles per investor.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will commence no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the records, the assets of AKB GASSTROYBANK were 335 places in the Russian banking system as of 1 August 2016.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIL died in Syria
Cadiza Sultan, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, reportedly died in Syria.
Tasnim Akunji's lawyer stated that her family found out about her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died as a result of a Russian air strike in Raqqa, a siege of a group in the country, as ITV News reported on Thursday.
The Sultane was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she planned to leave a war-torn country and return to England.
"We can only hope that the only advantage of all of this -- like a tombstone and a will to others -- is that these are the risks involved in a journey to a war zone -- to dissuade people from ever making the same choice," said Akunji.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family said that she married an ISIL militant in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reid claims that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the position of Supreme Justice if elected.
The leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reed, says that he is convinced that the democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected President.
The Republicans of the Senate blocked Garland's claim, as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The head of the majority group in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, states that the next president will choose the person who will be able to replace the last Judge of the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia.
Reid announced at the conference call on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland "with some confidence."
Representative Reid later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether she was going to propose Garland, and she was just making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to rock the boat with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid claimed that the Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination were the "receivers" and "assistants" of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't suitable for the job.
Treats states that erotic calendars for 'women as well as men'
The magazine "Treats" works with photographer David Bellmer to release the calendar for 2017, inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of naked celebrities, they aim to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with naked music.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with many nude models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because Playboy is for men.
I'm making it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is the same.
"We need to go back to the demonstration of an eternal and classic nude figure where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," said Shaw in a press release declaring the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can serve photos online or in open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscow will be given memos about unscrupulous Internet stores.
In Moscow, they're going to issue a memo that tells us how not to get victimized by an Internet store.
It's reported in Rostalesnadzor, written by M24.
It has been reported that government officials are preparing a memo that will help citizens to select online stores and identify possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of the brochure includes several sections.
These will be general information and legislative frameworks, rules for the delivery of goods, ways to protect their legitimate rights.
The annex will contain recommendations on how to correct the claim, and so on,” was explained in Rostpresnadzor.
The memo is currently being finalized.
It will then be posted on the Rostpresnadzor website in Moscow, and a printed version will be published and distributed to Moscow.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia issued a statement in which it named the second suspect in the organization of the sabotage in Crimea.
Persons from Ukraine and Russia who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts were detained.
Among them are Panov Evgeny Alexandrovich and Zakhtei Andrej Romanovich.
"They all make a confession," says the communication.
Earlier, a resident of the Zaporoz region, Yevgeny Panov, who had been detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, pleaded guilty during interrogation.
The FAS will fine Google 438 million roubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine of 438 million roubles on the Google Corporation, as reported on the agency's website.
"The fine for Google for violating competition law was 438 million roubles.
We hope that the company will execute our decision and pay the fine soon,” said Deputy Head of FAS, Alexei Dozenko.
In the course of the investigation, FAS found that Google supplied smartphone manufacturers that were sold on Russian territory with Google Play applications only on the condition that other corporate applications were installed on the device.
These applications include a search engine to be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates article 10, paragraph 1, of the FZ “Protection of Competition” (abuse of dominance).
We are confident that compliance will provide an opportunity to develop competition in the Russian mobile software market, which will benefit our consumers.
The Law “On the Protection of Competition” requires compliance with all companies whose products are supplied to the territory of the Russian Federation and transnational corporations, among them”, noted Elena Zaeva, Head of the Communications and Information Technology Regulatory Department of the Russian Federation.
The agency suspects 16 Russian shops to conspire.
The New Books Network has been fined for selling the book 50 Days Before My Suicide.
The New Bookshop Network is fined for selling Stace Kramer's book "50 Days Before My Suicide," reports the city news agency Moscow.
The text of the book may be considered “provoking or motivated to commit suicide among children and adolescents”, as reported in Rostreplesnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine.
The Continent District Court confirmed a violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products to children and ordered a fine of 49 copies of printed material seized by the Rosmesnadzor Authority.
The source at the New Bookshop confirmed that it was the work of Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that Moscow's largest bookshops were being tested for the book 50 Days Before My Suicide.
There'll be a memorial night in Moscow for Ernst the Unknown.
There'll be a memorial night in Moscow for the sculptor Ernst the Unknown, reports TASS.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central House of Literaries.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States personally.
Therefore, it was decided that the evening would be arranged for those who wished to commemorate it in their homeland,” the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress stated.
It noted that this was important for the widow of sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
Close friends of the Unknown were invited to attend the evening, including the poet Yevgeny Eutouchenko, the artist Boris Messererer, the president of the GMII, Pushkin Irina Antonov, director Mark Rosovsky, as well as the Minister of Culture of Russia, Vladimir Medinsky, the head of the Moscow Department of Culture, Alexander Kibovsky, and the deputy mayor of Moscow, Leonid Pekatnikov.
It has been previously reported that the relatives of Ernst the Unknown are planning a sculptor memorial in New York, allegedly before 14 August.
The final consumer blamed: Who actually buys records?
Single middle-aged men like vinyl.
And while you're not trying to clogg the comment section with harsh insults under the alias of not All Single Men of the Middle Ages, this statement is based on actual evidence.
According to YouTube, so much of the renaissance of the records is not due to the boom among the two thousand generation that wants to penetrate a new material, but to the nostalgia of the middle-aged.
Those who recently bought the vinyl album are likely to be between 45 and 54 years old, according to data.
Moreover, those belonging to the 18-24 age group are the least likely to be.
It's also not just an act of amateur gathering -- it has an emotional meaning: older buyers are slightly more likely to hold their feelings (56% versus 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% versus 66%).
But are the YouTube results correct?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me while I was walking down the center of the busy Soho street, in a humble gray suit and violently gestured before the stop, putting my hands together and saying something impressive like, "Let's see."
All right, let's see.
While Soho's heart is slowly losing its charms and dirt — hotels, cafes, Paperchase shops — now flooded with buildings once occupied by independent vendors — several music stores with fantastic specialists remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to different people in some of these shops and try to measure their age and emotional mood through surveillance.
A 55-year-old son of Glasgow Stewart, followed by me from Sister Ray (data calculation: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data calculation: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20 years old), in London for a half-day meeting, and went shopping for a few hours.
He's a collector, am I asking?
"I suppose so," he says.
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, as shown above (he sent me an e-mail photo, I didn't follow him home), line up the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring so many albums and singles is partly derived from his disposable income: he can now buy records that he could not afford when they first came out and buy out the items he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many of what I buy is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things for which I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are probably introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much.
That's my drawback.
Wez, 25 years old, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match the YouTube profile.
He noticed, however, a new wave of people under the influence of media noise, people who heard about their return and felt obliged to buy their old records.
Based on the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Clients who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records,” he says.
This may explain the boom among the leaders of the rebirth vinyl of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the records?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store, like Phonica, to realize that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wez, some older clients are, inter alia, insulted by the cash-free payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may experience a shock from the digital world and prefer to move to the constants of familiar records envelopes, objects that awaken memories of a quiet youth.
"I think that sometimes it may be filling a void or possessing material things as a sort of comfort," says Wes.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people do, too.
It's a simple way to keep your head occupied.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the record shelves.
An ICM survey in April showed that almost 50 percent of the people who bought the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% had a player they never used, while 7% of those who buy vinyl did not have a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably seem seriously puzzled by glistening through the shelves of Bosanov’s collections.
The "trofeal" aspect of the renaissance is what Johnny, 42 years old, observed at Sounds of the Universe (data calculation: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came in recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More of a piece, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older, they're a little under 20 who just get to know it.
Fopp, who's now taking almost the entire floor of vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops — the last synth and sexy pop Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation — it is good to see diversity in its clients.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to establish a traumatic psychological trauma with 30 seconds standing next to someone.
Eleanor, 27 years old, went on Fop for a few minutes, looking at the various records available on the market.
She's looking at goods, not spending money.
She doesn't earn much, she says, so collecting records is not a good option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of vinyl is ..." she's immersed in dreams with a breath full of love.
I don't know how to explain it -- it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl amateurs: City fashioners.
While I'm creating an illusion that I'm looking at jeans shorts, I'm watching a group of teenage girls gathering around Polaroid's camera every minute before Dad and his daughter start talking about buying a Crosley player.
On the left is a staircase with the walls of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mack, a mixture of modern styles and classics, binding records for any medium collection.
No one is looking — perhaps because they are just decorations, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "green vinyl."
But given that any attraction to these subjects can mean more money to the industry and send a few clients to the Soho for a while, there's hardly anything to complain about.
No wonder the segment of the population that is more likely than most people have more time and money than most people do is the layer that spends most money on luxury goods like vinyl.
But as long as my findings show that YouTube results are accurate, at least in Soho records stores, they do not exclude the existence of a huge number of female vinyl collectors and amateurs that exist in reality, in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work all the time in school or offices.
But they obviously don't spend the morning of Thursday shopping records on Berwick Street, gliving records and avoiding the eyes of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake host who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland’s Polar Shark — The Longest Living Vertebrate — Video Report
Scientists claim that Greenland’s polar shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, states that the record was set by a female aged 272 to 512 years and five meters long.
The French court rejects the offer to demolish shops in the jungle refugee camp
The French court rejected the offer of the Kale authorities to destroy dozens of home-made shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees lived.
At the court hearings this week, the Kale authorities argued that the State should be able to destroy a total of 72 home-made shops where people inside the camp sell goods, ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offering to cut or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or simple meals for several euros in home-made restaurants.
Prefecture Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, arguing that free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing camp population.
They said that homemade shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
Lille's court ruled that there was no legitimate reason to expel the people running 72 home-made shops, but stated that the problems of Calais prefecture were “comprehensible”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that shops, cafes and restaurants played a much larger role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely fragile conditions."
He said that the spaces provided a peaceful meeting point for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition was the Children ' s Café Jungle Book at the camp, which does not work for profit and offers 200 meals a day, English- and French-language classes and shelter counselling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children’s cafe.
A letter sent to Guardian stated that its closure “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not older than eight years of age”.
Two charities, aid to refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday, estimated that the jungle camp had grown to more than 9,000 people — the highest in history — after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Neighbourhood libraries invite young freelancers to educational programs.
This week, the Philial libraries will hold meetings on City Day, Russian Film Year, and even Physical Education Day.
The programs are focused on children's audiences, so they're mostly playing games.
Today, August 10th, Philial Library No. 2, in the linen neighborhood, invites "My little town" to a cruise presentation.
August 11th, at the Library of Philial No. 1 will be the time of the "I live in this city, I know this city."
There will be a multimedia lesson on the same day at the Library of Philial No. 2 entitled "Lands of Homeland Past Destiny".
And in the Philial Library No. 4 in Surajevka, a game program called "Film, Film, Film."
On Sunday, 14 August, for the boys in the northern neighbourhood, Philial Library No. 3 will host a game program called "Fiscult-Hello!"
Britain stops at silver in rugby 7 after Fiji's master class lets them take gold.
The impressive British series in Regby 7 was overwhelmingly stopped at the final obstacle by Fiji's team in the finals on Thursday night, when they were completely defeated by 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in ball ownership, dispersal, evasion, game support, line runs, and rough power to win gold, their first Olympic medal of any color.
The fall came with not too little consolation in the form of silver — the third one in Britain a day — and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Rigby-7 Olympic tournament, in which New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were defeated along the way.
The sick beating of Boxs, 7-5 in the semifinal earlier that day, could have returned to have a negative effect on them in the finals.
But, no matter what, Fiji, in this form, won the best team of 15 men.
This may be some consolation for Britain — but probably not — that at least one British man will hang a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s chief coach, Ben Ryan, former chief of England from Wimbledon.
It was a journey for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
Here they only lost one.
These blows will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji has started great for fun by beating up Britain’s attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like bumping into a convoy of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and World Series champions went up 5-0 when Ocea Collinisau dived into a corner.
Having four minutes on Jerry Tuway's watch, he added another touchdown on the right flank, which was realized.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The brilliant attempt to intercept Mitchell kept Leon Nakarawa's man from hitting the third, but it only delayed Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resumption and there was still more than a minute on the clock... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovovo then broke through several more sluggish attempts to intercept Britain and stormed the line to get a point.
The implementation led to 29-0 during the break.
It looked like Fiji was born to play rugby 7, while Britain is still mastering the craft.
Which, to a large extent, is true.
The UK was making massive replacements for half the game, and they blocked the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which, by the first half's standards, was good until Joshua Tuisov passed through a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton took an attempt for Britain, making a touchdown in the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game was long along the way for the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the stands.
It was impossible not to admire the full joy of Fiji ' s approach.
Mata William decorated the Fijian cake, which did not need to be decorated, with another attempt in the last few seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier on the same day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in its semi-final, and the United Kingdom slightly outpaced South Africa in the intense semi-final of one attempt for each, the difference between British implementation.
Kyle Brown leads the Boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with some great leg work and beat it under the beams in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept Marcus Watson, brother of 15 to the British team, Anthony, won – and eventually a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the coach's fight against cancer.
There'll be no more exciting gold at these games, and that's something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy climbs to history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an added value of their gold moment on Estación da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three voices in the boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always as long as they sought the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's couples, the first women in British sports annals to reach that height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th unfailing performance, again unprecedented.
What we can see is that two brilliant athletes, slipping over the surface with the elegantness of the swans, do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every gold roared a battalion of ready hands that contributed to the gradually growing victories that were important, and there were no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to see the day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It's a little different for your future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio's lucky he could start treatment early in 2014 in the inter-season, keeping the break down schedule minimal, if that could be the right expression in circumstances like these.
I needed payment, so I needed to recover quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the department -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said there were enough steps.
That's how it starts.
The grave itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
The second they won, their first thoughts were on Williams, who spent the nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, the captain of an artillery regiment with a service in Afghanistan behind her shoulders, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe it's a little too much, but it means so much."
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin, too.
It was fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nobody, so thank him very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
This couple is setting a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even on the last 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were really in phase.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's very important not to get involved right now.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we didn't try to do anything amazing.
We weren't waiting for fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to get out and win this race, which we did.
It'll take a couple a year to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, her own with a TV adventurer, Steve Beckshall.
Right now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I became the Olympic Champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government extended the destruction of sanctions products
The Government extended until the end of 2017 the destruction of foodstuffs prohibited from entering Russia.
The decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo against countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was imposed in our country in August 2014.
The ban has since been extended several times and is now in force until December 31, 2017.
Russia is prohibited from importing certain agricultural products, raw materials and foods from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruit and dairy products were banned.
The disposal of food brought into the country bypassing the embargo has been under way in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were removed from the market.
Hunting the "prohibited"
Rains and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow on Friday.
There will be an atmospheric front across the metropolitan region that will bring precipitation and lower the temperature of the air.
The air will warm up to 25 degrees of heat during the day.
For example, on Saturday night in Moscow there will be short-term rains, storms and wind surges up to 15 m/s.
Rain is expected during the day with storms and winds up to 12-17 m/s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also predicted in Orlovsk, Kursk and Voronezhsk oblasts, reporting Days.ru.
Next week, the rainfall is unlikely.
The WTO Arbitrators Panel found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
Import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia upon accession to the WTO.
“This is the first time the WTO has taken a decision against the Russian Federation”, says a report on the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their opinion that the EU had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures were “systematic” or “comprehensive”.
Russia, in turn, has promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators shortly.
This is stated in the report of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to complain to the World Trade Organization about Russia's actions, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, Financial Times wrote that U.S. behaviour in resolving controversial issues in WTO undermined the organization’s principles of discussion.
Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members made a similar statement because Americans refused to approve South Korean Judge Chan Song Hwa for a second term.
Therefore, Russia will not approach the WTO on the question of Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now comprises 162 countries.
Russia joined in 2012.
The president's administration has been replaced by a leader.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed former Deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Wyno as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin reorganized the presidency and expressed the hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
Anton Vineo, in turn, stated during the meeting that he considered the anti-corruption work begun as head of the administration of President Ivanov to be important and promised to cooperate with the Government.
In the past, Izvestia has written that experts consider the resignation of Sergei Ivanov as the chief of administration to be transparent and understandable, and the reshuffling of the Kremlin administration will not fundamentally change anything.
They note that the leader who has been working in the President ' s administration for a long time has effectively built up the activities of AP.
He was replaced by Deputy Chief of Administration Anton Vine, a man who knows the specifics of this job.
In Poland, it is admitted that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The Polish State Oil and Gas Company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years the supply of gas from the Russian Federation may become unattractive to it due to the redirection of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company, Bogoslaw Majec.
His words are passed on to TASS.
"Maybe it happens that we're not going to buy any gas at Gazprom, we're going to diversify our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines for us will be East, SPG-terminals and Norway's raw materials,” said Majec.
Gazprom currently dominates the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had delivered almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, 30 per cent above the 2015 level.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG procurement rose to 49.8 per cent, compared to 40 per cent a year earlier.
On 22 July, the Polish Antimonopoly Authority did not agree on the establishment of the Gazprom joint venture and its European partners in the construction of the Northern Flow-2 gas pipeline.
This month earlier, Poland left Gazprom's request for 11 billion cubic metres of gas for North Flow-2.
Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President of the Holding Board, said that.
The North Flow 2 auction will take place in 2017 and the auction is planned to take place in the autumn of 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to take any action in connection with the Polish party's intention to withdraw long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, and Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President of the Board of the Company, stated.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year Poles only increased 42 per cent of the purchase of Russian gas.
The Deputy Gazprom added that the mere fact that a Polish PGNIG application had been filed with the Stockholm Arbitration Court did not mean that the negotiations had been terminated.
The Polish company had previously gone to court to reduce the purchase price of Russian gas.
Recall that the Polish Government's Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Petr Naimsky, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to renew the Gasprom contract for the supply of gas.
The Polish contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish Government Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, stated that his country could refuse to supply blue fuel from the east in six years.
He said that Warsaw was planning to build a new terminal for the supply of Baltic Pipe liquefied natural gas, which would connect the country to the Norwegian shelf.
Northflow-2 provides for the construction of two sea gas pipeline threads with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic metres per year from Russia to Germany on the Baltic Sea floor.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine ' s border with Crimea.
Alexander Hug, the first head of the SMS in Ukraine, reported this.
"I can confirm that the SMS has increased the number of observers in this field," he said, in response to a question from the journalists, he transmits RIA News.
According to OSCE, the situation on the border between Ukraine and Crimea is calm and there are no security incidents.
Observers monitored what was happening at three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of a passenger jet, Yak-42, landed at Ufa airport on the Internet, which landed 400 metres outside the airstrip and crashed on the left wing.
The video was released by "360".
The emergency occurred at 4:30 Moscow time.
The cruise of Krasavia arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to a parking lot.
Ufa airport is operating in normal mode.
The PRC's Radar Investigation Department has been investigating the reason for the heavy landing of the aircraft.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Stephan de Mistura, believes that this has happened incontrovertible.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of the inter-Syrian talks, which should begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists have initiated investigations into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian town of Aleppo.
First information on the toxic gas attack, allegedly chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
The opposition then stated that, in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down the previous day, the aircraft had dropped poisonous bombs, but in Moscow the charges were called a throw.
The Russian Ministry of Defence later accused the opposition group Harakyat Nur Al-Din al-Zinka of having happened.
Soon it was reported that the bombs filled with toxic gas were two.
This was confirmed by BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I smelled gas, began to burn my eyes, became difficult to breathe," quotes an eyewitness's editorial.
At least seven people died in the attack and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the action will be considered a war crime.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said to the journalists, "There is a lot of proof that this has actually happened."
The non-use of chlorine for military purposes is prescribed in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of the use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the daily shelling of its areas and by terrorists preventing people from leaving the city.
According to Reuters, the United Nations expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in hostilities.
The organization's three-hour daily tranquillity regime is considered “insufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped”.
Staffan de Mistura ' s humanitarian adviser, Jan Egeland, stated that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required each week to deliver relief and evacuate the sick and wounded to the city.
“We have to send bulk cargo from a convoy of trucks to areas where roads are virtually destroyed and those that remain are mined”, said Mr. Egeland. “But the Russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table.”
Consultations between the representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” continue in Geneva.
How Russia opened the "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia announced on 11 August the establishment of a three-hour cessation of hostilities regime, which will operate daily from Thursday.
The creation of “humanitarian windows” is designed to provide the conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and basic necessities to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation has been taken against the backdrop of increasing international pressure on Moscow to halt the military operation and to facilitate the resumption of the negotiating process.
Four people were killed in a series of explosions in Thailand's resorts.
Immediately several explosions took place in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people died in the attack, 19 were injured.
The explosion epicenter hit the city of Hua-Hin.
Ten foreigners, four nationals and no Russians were among the victims.
None of the terrorist groups had yet taken responsibility for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs had rushed to state that Islamists were not involved in the incident.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of organizing the bombings.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the scale and characteristics of the bombings indicated that they had been directed against the military leaders of the country.
Attacks occurred in popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the area of Phuket and in the cities of Hua Hin, Thrang and Surat Thani.
After the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, an increase of 1.5 million over the 2015 figures.
The first suspects in preparation and organization of the attacks have already been apprehended, as reported by police colonel Krisana Patanacharoen.
It was too early to speak of objectives, he added, but in the Ministry of Internal Affairs the countries were “convinced that they were not linked to international extremist groups”.
It's too early to draw conclusions,' said Mr. Patancharoen.
But we know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact, they are local sabotages, and we are trying to identify those behind them.
The bombings occurred on the birthday of Queen Sikrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely to target it.
According to police general Sithichi Srisopacharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely, with a difference of half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on lively streets filled with restaurant tourists.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl selling street food.
The identities of the other victims are not yet known, but they are known to be residents of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai Police, four Germans, three Dutch nationals, two Italians and an Austrian citizen were among them.
There are no Russians among the victims of the bombings, and Rostourism's press service has been reported.
The local experts also linked the bombings to the referendum held on 7 August, in which 61.4 per cent of the population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitution drafting commission appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role to play in the election of the Prime Minister.
The new system has been adopted and will be tested for the first time in the parliamentary elections of 2017.
We recall that a military coup took place in Thailand on 22 May 2014 under the leadership of the army commander of Praut Chang-Ocha.
To that end, he said, the army had been driven by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military established the National Peace and Order Council, imposed curfews and censorship, dispersed protesters and the upper House of Parliament.
How Bangkok was in a state of emergency
The Thai Government, led by Premier Yinglak Chinawat, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the surrounding provinces in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Like two explosions went off in Bangkok.
In January 2014, in the centre of Bangkok, two explosions occurred near the Monument of Victory, where one of the main protests took place, affecting 28 people, five of whom were in critical condition.
The explosions were made by unknown motorbikes.
The authorities reinforced security measures in the capital and engaged military forces to protect the demonstrators.
The development of conditions has begun in Dry Loga.
According to OS, the Government has been asked to agree on the draft terms of the gold ore auction for the Dry Log, while maintaining two key restrictions.
It is proposed that a company with 25 per cent or more of foreign ownership and those whose capital will not have a minimum of 25 per cent of State participation be excluded from the auction.
The industry does not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players are already not at risk of taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Nature has submitted to the Government a draft order and terms of the auction for the largest undeveloped gold mine in Russia, Suhoi Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), and has told two sources of OS familiar with the situation.
The project was introduced on Wednesday evening, and one of them is clarified.
The Ministry of Nature has confirmed that the project has been submitted to the government.
A representative of Vice-Prime Officer Alexander Cloponin said "OJ" that the project had not yet been introduced to the office of the official.
“An auction may be announced in August as soon as the Government order has been issued, and given the deadline for soliciting bids from potential bidders (at least 45 days) may take place in October”, said the Ministry of Nature.
According to OS, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, as described in the version, which was sent to the ministries and FOIVs in July (there is an OS).
The first is the presence of at least 25 per cent of government participation in capital.
The second is the denial of access to the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FM-57 on investments in strategic societies.
According to the two draft articles, the FS, as already written by OS on 2 August, may not be allowed to auction by companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions because Dry Log is a federal subsoil (over 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies”, but refused to comment on the details prior to the Government's order.
The requirement of State participation in the auction was put forward by Irkutsk oblast, said "OK" in the Ministry of Nature in December 2015, and later confirmed by the Governor of the Region, Sergei Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor, Sergei Eroschenko, who had “investment agreements with Rostech”.
Those who lobbyed for the restriction on the admission of foreigners don't know what they're talking about.
"But it's in the spirit of time: not to give control in Russia's largest gold field against the background of Western sanctions," he reasoned with the "OJ" who was familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The Head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergey Donskaya, stated on 1 August that foreigners “can go to the consortium” if the applicants engage them “as financial entities, as technological partners”.
The interviewees think it's unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender in the industry is the consortium of the largest gold miner of the PAO Pole, controlled by the son of Sleiman Kerimov Said, and Rostech.
In July, the partners created the SP "SL Gold", where the Poles had 51% shares, and the Rostech RT-GR structure had 49%.
In Rostekh, comments were rejected, and the Pole stated “OW” that “unquestionably, it is an asset that has an interest” and has all the necessary competences and resources to develop it.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be taken after the terms have been announced," was added to the Pole.
AFROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision of the Russian government was said by the sources "OJ".
The Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, developing assets in Chukotka, claimed to be able to participate in the development of Dry Loga, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to OS, were not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, the head of the Union of Gold Industries of the Russian Federation, Sergey Kashuba, estimated the “OJ” investment in Dry Log at $2.5 billion to $4 billion.
Most potential applicants discourage not only the amount of investment but also the complexity of the project: there is a need for serious exploration of stocks and techniques for handling complex ores, explaining the industry's "OO" interlocutors.
On the pension market, the largest M&A deal, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, started the process of merging four NPFs under control.
As a result, a NPF with savings of some 373 billion roubles will be established on the basis of the Pension Fund.
The introduction of the consolidation of the four pension funds, KIT Finance, Promagrophone, Legacy and Gazfund Pension Savings, was announced by the owner of 100 per cent of KIT Funds by the Pension Administrator.
“The reorganization shall be carried out in agreement with the CB, subject to the requirement that the terms of the contracts in force remain unchanged”, states the company's communication.
The merger is based on the Pension Fund.
According to the CEO of the NPF, Oleg Bjalošiski, the pooling of funds has several challenges: expanding the geography of presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
He said that the target date for the completion of the consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the National Fund for Pension Savings, the NPF will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As at 31 March, the pooled fund ' s pension savings amounted to more than 373 billion roubles.
According to the reports on the Fund's website, the beneficiaries of the Fund's owner, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko ( 65 per cent under the control of the JLG) and the Gazzond NPF (35%).
However, the group itself launched much later the competitors.
For example, NPF group O1 "The Future" swallowed the Stahlfund earlier this year.
The joint NPF is now joining Uralcib and the Russian Standard.
“In addition to reducing costs, integration is necessary to meet structural objectives”, notes NPF Director, “The Future”, Nikolai Sidorov.
The Safmar-NPF European, Education and Science and Regional Fund have been active in consolidating funds since April and should be integrated into the Safmar NPF by the end of this year.
They will be joined by the Trust NPF in 2017.
“The pooling of funds will have the effect of strengthening control over risks, operations and costs”, noted in the Safmar pension group.
The pause in the pooling of funds that KIT Finance Pension Administrator has endured may be due to several reasons, are indicated by the experts.
Until recently, NPF could not purchase more than 40 per cent of the infrastructure bonds that the group was actively placing on.
Following the amendment of the CB regulation in March this year, there are no further restrictions on a number of issuers meeting the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, the entire issue can be purchased by one major player,” says the director of the AKRA Financial Institutes Rating Group, Yuri Nogin.
Several NPF top 15 asset managers refer to the separation of areas of influence and, as a result, to the staffing of a single fund that should have been agreed upon by the group owners.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenko was not available for comment.
Nor did the Gazzond NPF respond to an OS request.
While the consolidation of funds is a labour-intensive and cheap exercise, this decision will be justified at a long distance.
As noted by Sergey Okolesnov, CEO of the Pension Partners Consulting Company, the Gazfonda Pension Savings has fewer outflows, joining will stabilize the group's other funds base.
In doing so, the better experience of NPF KIT Finance and the Promagrophone will be needed in the construction of retail sales by OPS, as well as in the use of more modern software.
The CB demands for NPF processes and human resources are constantly increasing, so it is not appropriate to duplicate infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, and Paul Mitrofanov, Managing Director of Corporate Rating, “Expert RA”, considers it inappropriate.
“The effect of reducing duplicative functions will definitely cover the possible costs of merging”, notes Mr. Mitrofanov.
Sergey Ocolesnov estimates the cost of the merger of the four funds to be 30-50 million roubles.
“The cost of the four funds of this size is about 400 million roubles per year, with the consolidation of the budget in the medium term effectively halved”, I am sure Mr. Ocolesnov.
The best Disney movie, "Pete and his dragon," was released in Russian.
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the graceful dragon, the persuasive story, and the country-style songs are enough to rethink old-fashioned magic, according to ELENA CRAWSON.
The frightened little boy was picked up by a dragon who became a human baby and a gentle babysitter and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his buddy Elliot, after a puppy in a story book, plays catch-up with him and falls asleep in his arms.
Six years later, when he was thrown in the hedges, he could no longer be distinguished from another intelligent forester, Mowgli.
That's how Pete finds Grace's red-haired female herder (Brace Dallas Howard), while Gavin's team (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressive in the woods.
Now she has to believe not only in the existence of the dragon but also help to save him.
Pete is taking an accelerated course of being a human being surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear shirts, a moral code in the heart, and smiles more glamorous than any commercial.
No character looks or acts too terrible for a viewer to really hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who discovered a hunt for an atypical forest resident, is far from a permanent villain.
A huge, furry dragon has also turned out to be at all cool, with the good face of a bulldog, the flying wingspan, and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon is funny, squealing, even whimpering, and fortunately doesn't say, but it's always about to be ironed, and it's very different from all the famous cinematographic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his way of holding is such a high degree of emotional engagement that, at the most stressful moments, weeping desperately in three streams, not only for small audiences, but also for adults.
Amazingly good, and young Oakes Figgle in the role of Pete, breaking up between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtually gives out a canonical grandfather who would love to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowry manage to make a fantasticly sweet remake of the forgotten Disney film "Dracon Pete" of 1977, mediocrely from the nose to the tip of his tail and memorized only by mixing animations and playing movies, and make it the most emotional film of this summer?
It's just a miracle that helped.
In his painting, Lowry, in fact, took only two things from the original: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There's music numbers and most of the weird jokes.
This fairy tale reads the traits taken from Bambi, Alien, and many other beautiful children's paintings.
Disney continues to successfully expand the Gallery of High-quality Remakes of the 21st Century.
Of course, "Pete and Dragon" isn't as stunningly beautiful as "The Book of the Jungle," and it doesn't have the masterful villain that Kate Blanchett turned out to be the stepmother in the new Cinderella.
But this naive film is no less successful in believing in miracles and good in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to Disney's magic castle, Director Lowry, will be given again for the artistic adaptation of the story of Peter Pane.

RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov will be charged with a new charge.
The lawyers of RBK journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of an extremist organization, stated that the prosecutor ' s office had found shortcomings in the case of their client.
We learned that the prosecutor's office made this presentation just yesterday from the investigators.
We were scheduled to attend a court hearing on the limitation of access to the criminal case file, but the hearing was not held, and the investigators informed us of the presentation made by the Public Prosecutor's Office,” RBK quotes counsel Olga Dinze.
She said that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had indicated to the investigators that there was a discrepancy between the qualifications of the case and the material collected.
Now the investigators will have to fill the gaps in the evidence base and bring new charges against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (PC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze explains.
Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015, as reported by OS.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation had excluded from the prosecution the RBC journalist the phrase “destroying the political situation towards instability” and “the overthrow of power by illegal means”.
Aleksandre ZILBERT, a correspondent of Commersant Boscosport, lived as an Olympic in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian team, lunched in the local dining room, and even passed the WADA test after that.
I don't think life's dying for a second.
Even at night.
The final launches sometimes end at midnight, after which athletes need an hour and a half to return to the Olympic village.
Moreover, settlement and eviction from the village continue unabated, as some athletes complete their performances and leave Brazil, while some are only arriving here.
At 7:30 a.m., heads of all the Olympic delegations are stretched into one of the time shadows.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational household matters, says Igor Kazykov, head of the Russian Olympic delegation.
It's a hot water problem, so I'm sorry, toilets.
We've been fighting for a long time to be clean.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the clinters started to come, but they just put some stuff on the floor, that's all.
The floors are, you see, innovative.
Like, you can't wash them in human form.
We know these floors. They're common laminates.
Anyway, we got a shift in the clining company, and now it's OK.
The Olympic village is such a Southern Butvo, a sleeping area surrounded on one side by mountains, and on the other by an impressive trench of water.
And for the sake of reliability, there's still a two-metre iron fence around the perimeter, along which the automatics walk.
A total of 17,000 people can be accommodated in the village in 3,604 apartments located in 31 houses.
One of the 18-story buildings has a huge Russian flag on it, which is a house that is entirely reserved for our team.
Looking at a small lobby at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems seem to be most pressing for a domestic team.
There are two announcements at the registration counter: the printed "Please don't throw paper in the toilet!" and hand-held "I'll give you badges.
The bar itself drowns in booklets.
Their fun color contrasts with the titles of the brochures: "The Remembrance of Infectious Diseases for Going to Rio de Janeiro", "The First Help in drowning, Aborigines in Breathing Pathways, Loss of Consciousness - Phases of Cardiovascular Reanimation", "The First Help in Burns, Heat Impact, Breaks and Bloods".
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example: "Infectation is accompanied by fever and subsequent recovery.
However, not all are waiting for a favourable outcome.
Of course, the Russian team has a health centre that is available at any time to provide the residents with qualified assistance, including relaxing and sports massages.
On the contrary, the medical centre is the very headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspirational poster, "No matter what, we're gonna win!"
And, of course, poems:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Even less of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, it will not break!
And there is an announcement to raise the spirit: "Dear brothers and sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia Kirille, the protojee Andrey Vladimirovich Alexeyev is the spiritual guardian of the athletes of the Russian Olympic team.
You can order prayer and other demands on the phone...
In general, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religious Ceremonies for all faiths in the village.
And the Russians, in a privileged position, they have their own chapel.
Because of the load of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs recommended for use during the fire.
And in the dark, I tripped over the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, it was a sleeping staff member of the new Clining Company.
I believe that at any time they're ready to go to the innovative floors, they've decided to set themselves up a quiet hour directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was expected to meet a longtime acquaintance, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, a trainer of our bathers, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and the European champion, Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
We live in two, and the beds are almost tampered with, but it's not critical.
It's one on four, but it's spacious.
The closet, of course, is funny, from the fabric, doesn't give rise to trust, but you can put things down.
"No, you're pretending they're out of tea!" the tennis player Svetlan Kuznetsov, whom I met in the main dining room.
Its main name is at least because it represents a space of 2,700 square metres and is ready to receive 5,000 visitors at the same time.
They give 60,000 meals a day at the top of the table, completely free of charge.
The menu options are: "The Best of Brazil", "The Kitchens of the World", "The Asian Foods" and "Pizza, Pasta Products".
The last option, as I saw, is very popular with our volleyballists.
But let's say I didn't find any soups in any of the units of a giant restaurant.
What kind of soup is that?
It's a good thing I brought Chinese with me.
And a kettle.
But in fact, just so you know, we've got worse food on our courts.
At least there's something you can choose, despite unbearable uniformity.
I personally chose cod for the pair and meatballs in tomato sauce.
A tablet with its name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, as well as the food value of the product and the availability of allergists, is placed next to each dish.
Well, I'll tell you, it was edible.
I don't even know why this line is always at the local McDonald's.
Saturated, relaxed, you can say warm athletes coming out of the restaurant waiting for our best friends from the World Antidoping Agency (WADA).
They're lured by a smart quiz, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
Provocation, you can say!
To get a gift, you have to answer at least eight of ten questions correctly.
I've got questions in Russian! - I've been attacked by a woman from WADA.
But he attacked the wrong one.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic impulse, naturally.
The situation became more acute on the second question: "If I have received a notification of doping control, should I go to the doping control point immediately?"
I've stopped at option B, "No, I have one hour."
Lost, so to speak, my guard.
I forgot that the WADA didn't have to wait to relax.
Anyway, we have to show up right now.
And in the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation became critical.
I thought, for some reason, if I find it difficult to keep a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and by the way, it's hard!), I could use bio-additions to get "additional nutrients to increase my productivity."
No, they won't!
In fact, the answer is formulated in a manner that does not categorically prohibit, but strongly discourages several sentences.
This WADA is not playing fair!
How's it going, Russia?
There's no backing back, behind Ephimov, behind Isinbayev, and our entire bloodless team.
That's why I focused, and I won an unfortunate shirt with my last strength.
Know what they say, ours!
In a victorious mood, I went to the fitness center next door.
I'm interested in counting the simulators.
It's 250.
He was surprised to note that no Russian athletes had been found in this pile of runways.
But maybe it's the right thing to do.
Let someone who can't play!
But there's a guy sitting in a health centre next to us.
In line for the eye doctor.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
In the health centre, as in the whole village, there is a condom delivery machine.
It is inscribed on it with an enchanting call, "Continue with the condom."
The next thing to do is to spin a iron that looks like a door lock, and a condom made of natural latex in the Amazon is ready to drop out of the machine.
I've got one to remember.
The athletes won't get away with it, they've been brought in 450,000.
A whole entertainment center is available for the celebration and celebration of the Olympic village.
There's an educational plaque next to him that reminds us that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day in various ways on athletes.
The center is flooded with video games, pool and tennis tables, board football and hockey, and some strange devices that look like video apps.
- I'm interested in a comrade in Ukrainian form who actively uses a wild toy.
You could, of course, just say you don't want to talk to a man in Russian uniform, that's all.
I mean, there's a strange confluence of circumstances in the eyes of the guys in yellow and blue.
The most playful team, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to get around the village by looking at every corner of the village.
But if you walk, rather than ride electric carts, you'll be able to open up a Canadian team home with salmon at the entrance and tent at the repair bath, a ticket office, a laundry, a dry cleaner, a hairdresser, a flower shop, a daily goods store, and a unique stamp post office (only you won't be able to wait from Chinese philatelics), and a bank, and a finder's office, and a photocopier.
And late in the evening, you will sit next to an olive tree, clothed with colored tapes, in memory of the friends and relatives of athletes who have left this world.
And you're going to be under a machine that dispersally sprays the insect-death fluid, thinking about the eternal.
I mean, the Olympic movement.
Which doesn't stop for a minute in this village.
While the rest of the Russian world watched the Australians almost punish the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Not many people know that the news that Inna Derígekova won gold at the XXXI Olympics was first.
Maybe I'm the only Moscowman who's ever seen it happen -- except for those who, of course, watched the Carioca competition that night.
Only a true fan can understand that.
Imagine a deaf Moscow night.
The neighbors at the bottom -- as always by 1:00 a.m. -- wake up and begin to shout at each other in a hateless but loud manner.
And it's threatening to move the furniture.
There's a crane running in the kitchen. There's no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
The TV calendar doesn't make any sense, so I just kept track of Mach, First, and just to be safe, Russia, though it's almost pointless.
"Russia" is the home of repetitives, all the sports are on the record for some reason.
There's a live show.
Hope, of course, for "Match" -- all night long, a young man shouted in news stories first about the great semi-final of Deri-eyeov-Shanaev, then about the coming gold fight.
It would make sense to show you.
But instead, basketball is US-Australia.
I can't say anything wrong about that decision, by the way.
The Australians were equal, the first half won.
They put the Americans in the spot of their own greatness.
As a result, they did lose, but as they now say, the Olympic basketball tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but there's a fight coming up with Dee Francesca, and there's no change on the screen.
I'm starting to run channels in a little panic.
It feels like it's the second time in a row.
All right, let's go down to the cables.
None of Match's thematic fencing.
Oh, I feel like the fight's about to begin.
I don't like texting and tweeting some sports sites.
Sudden surfing produces unexpected but brilliant results.
The site First turns out to be a direct technical broadcast of all the competitions that take place at this point in time.
I'm calling for a fencing, I'm getting a gold fight.
Deri-eye is a great counterattack, goes up the glasses, and obviously starts to take time.
The Italian woman's playing almost the whole thing.
Ours is one point ahead, a little more than two seconds to the end.
Dee Francesca throws at Deri eyes, then retreats, the time is running out, the Italian woman injects.
Victory!
In a few seconds, the Olympic messaging officer on the phone reports a fourth gold medal.
So I'm the first person to see it with my own eyes.
Crazy, faithful, involved.
The Muslim Religious Authority (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, the DUM plenary instructed its imams to carry out Friday sermons only in Tatar to make young Tatars learn their mother tongue.
The Directorate states that this “does not in any way impair” the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazani complains that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60 per cent of the parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
Imams fear that their sermons will not reach the entire audience in Tatar.
Yesterday, the plenary of the DUM Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the Republic in Tatar language only.
As Tatarstan's mufti Kamil Samigullin has said, this should be an incentive for young Tartars to learn their mother tongue.
"For those who say "heavy," in every large mosque, we intend to organize the Tatar language classes completely free of charge," promised Mr. Samigullin.
He added that “the decision has already come into effect” and today, in all mosques, “must be in Tatar”.
He recalled that the DUM Tatarstan publishes the magazine Shura with typical sermons in Tatar.
The imam, who doesn't speak enough Tatar, "can prepare for them thoroughly."
DUM Tatarstan brings together more than 1,000 parishes in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to the Mufti, in the districts of Friday, the preaching work is conducted exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, in Kazan, Russian was used mainly in a number of mosques.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced at the Burneyev Mosque, Zakabanna and Enilaire.
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed that it was the task of the leadership to ensure that all students had the knowledge of the two national languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
“No harm can be said to Netar Muslims,” Mr. Muhametshin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself is “not compulsory, the main part of the prayer”.
In doing so, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, and the mosques will retain lectures and lessons in Russian.
At the same time, Rafiq Muhametshin said "OJ" that there was no serious threat of being pushed out of the mosques.
Other languages than Russian and Tatar, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are said not to be used in the Republic ' s s sermons.
The decision of the DMW was strongly supported by the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (WCC).
The head of the WCT Executives, Rinat Zakrov, said "OK" and said, "Meceti are an important part of our national life."
It would be unfortunate if Tatar had left this area.
He noted that preaching only in the Tatar language “the desire of the imams themselves”, but in the VCT excerpt “they consider it to be the right thing to do”.
The imams interviewed, who preached in Russian, are willing to comply with the decision of the DUM, but they believe that the church members will have difficulties understanding the clergy.
Both the Tatars and the Russians go to the mosque.
A lot of people don't understand language.
They're gonna be a little tight, of course.
"We have to rebuild," says the Imam of the Burneyev Mosque, Farhat Mavlettinov.
According to him, Russian sermons are even closer to many Tatars, because “Russian in both schools and in kindergartens, on radio everywhere in the first place”.
However, he believed that the mosque would be able to continue its classes and lectures in Russian, which were held on other days.
We rely on God.
He concluded, "God will show you the way out of this situation."
But about 60% of us don't speak Tatar.
These are Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Azerbaijanis.
There's a lot of foreign students coming to us: Africans, Arabs.
"So we've been in Russian for four years," says the imam.
He believes that in the Tatar language the sermon will “go to a narrower circle and not reach the entire audience”.
But we will obey the decision of the plenary.
Just the outcome of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
"For example, it will only be easier for me because the Tatar language is my mother tongue," concluded Gabdullah Galiullin.
Former director of FSIN has been brought to trial.
The Moscow Prosecutor ' s Office upheld the indictment in the criminal case of theft of the budget allocated to the Russian Federation ' s FSIN, which was investigated by the SCR.
Ex-chief Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who caused more than 2.7 billion roubles to be tried, will be brought before the court.
The Metropolitan Prosecutor's Office has sent a criminal case to the Zamoscvorec Rysud against the former Director of the Russian Federal Penal Correction Service, Alexander Reimer, his former deputy, Nikolai Crivolapov, and Victor Odenov, Director of the Federal Penal Enforcement Service Information and Communication Centre (FICU) of the Federal Penal Enforcement Service.
Depending on their role and degree of involvement in the commission of crimes, they are charged by the SCRG in Moscow under article 285, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code (abuse of authority with serious consequences), article 159, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code (fraud committed using their official position in an organized group in a particularly large amount).
In addition, Kryvolapov is charged under article 222, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the SCR, in 2010-2012, the individuals in question fraudulently stole from the State Treasury the budget allocated by FSIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for controlled persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
In order to steal money from the budget, the team developed a scheme whereby the PITOC FGCO, under its supervision, with which the relevant government contracts were concluded, produced technical controls and supervision, including “electronic bracelets”, and implemented at prices that were overstated several times.
Despite the lack of production equipment, buildings, facilities and facilities for the production of the final production cycle of electronic bracelets, the FSIN and the Russian Federation entered into five government contracts valued at more than 3.3 billion roubles.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion roubles were found in the accounts of the Samar branch of the FGL, of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million roubles of cash in cash were received personally by Mr. Raimer in his office from an accomplice for whom a criminal case has been assigned to a separate proceeding.
Nikolai Crivolopov, who was involved in the frauds, was found to have an unknown origin of a medal gun, allowing him to be charged with additional charges.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, the FSIN filed a claim for damages in the amount of 2.7 billion roubles against the accused.
Hakan Shukür's football player is suspected of involvement in the putsch.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former footballer and then a member of Parliament, Hakan Shukür, and searched two homes of his family.
The star of Turkish football in the 1990s, the early 2000s attacker Hakan Shukur, is wanted by the national authorities in connection with the attempted coup d'état that took place last month.
Forward, who completed his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to a “armed terrorist group”.
This is a movement of Chimset, a society associated with a well-known Turkish religious figure and oppositionist Fathullah Gülen.
It is his President, Erdoğan, who considers himself the organizer of the military coup attempt that took place on 15 July.
Fathullah Gülen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
Local media reports that a warrant for Hakan Shukür ' s arrest was issued today, and police have already searched two houses belonging to the former footballer ' s family.
According to the investigation, his father also joined the Fathullah Gülen organization, in addition to Hakan Shukür.
However, neither the former footballer nor his loved ones were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a football player, Hakan Shukur defended the colors of several Turkish clubs and promoted the country's team.
He spent most of his career at Galatasarea.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as English "Blackburn".
True, he didn't spend more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukür is still the most effective attacker of the Turkish team, with 112 matches for the national team and 51 hits.
In 2013, Hakan Shukür left his deputy position because of an ongoing corruption investigation around Erdogan's party and its immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurryet, at least 42 journalists were arrested in Turkey on 25 July.
They are accused of contributing to the military coup and their links with the opposition Islamic preacher Fathullah Gülen, who lives in the United States.
Given the seriousness of the charges, media officers can wait for lengthy prison sentences ranging from 10 years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas for domestic films only.
"I would have set up a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinemas, which cost two or three times less tickets than for foreign films," he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that Russian films find it difficult to compete for a viewer with large Hollywood tapes.
We have over 100 paintings in the country each year, with an average of 20 to 25 tapes reaching the screens.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with Transformers and Iron Man, "with huge budgets in their promotion," said the film director.
Recall that on 1 July, the All-Russian Youth Education Forum “Tavrida” began its work in Crimea.
Participants include artists and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian fields from all over Russia and a number of countries of the near and distant frontier.

The new contractor promises to deliver Zenith Arena by December 26th.
The new designer of the St. Petersburg stadium, which is to accept the competitions of the Confederate Cup 2017 and the 2018 World Cup, Metrostre promises to deliver the arena by December 26, reports to RIA Newsty, with reference to Vadim Tulpánov, head of the Federation's interim commission to prepare for the 2018 World Cup.
"Today, we visited the construction site with the Minister of Sports of Russia, Vitaly Mutko, and with us was the CEO of Metrostria, Vadim Alexandrov.
He said he'd rent out the stadium by December 26th.
It's a serious peterburg company, it never breaks the deadline.
Vitaly Mutko and I were content with what we saw and heard," quotes the interview agency.
Vitaly Mutko had previously arrived in St. Petersburg to inspect the venue of the upcoming large-scale competition.
Mr. Tulpanov also noted that his Sovfed Commission would continue to monitor progress in the construction of the stadium and would visit the construction site regularly.
It is recalled that yesterday it was reported that Metrostrost will complete Zenit Arena's construction, which will cost about 5.4 billion roubles. The same company has won the tender to improve the area around the stadium, the contract price is 2.4 billion roubles. The contracts with Transstre Corporation, Transstre Corporation Engineering Corporation and Transstre AO were terminated.
Two other companies were not allowed to fight for the construction of the stadium.

In Miassa, Chelabin oblast, a lawyer from former vice-governor Nikolai Sandakova, Constantine Aculic, was detained.
According to OS-South Ural, another defendant's lawyer, Sergey Kolosovsky, Constantine Akulić, was summoned today to the SKR investigation department of Miassa to charge him with beatings a year ago.
Constantine Aculic then went to the scene as a lawyer to help one of his participants.
"It was initially aroused against unidentified persons, and now that he began to defend Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out to be Aculic," Sergey Kolosovsky.
Constantine Aculic became the former Governor's lawyer at the beginning of August.
At the same time, half an hour before a lawyer was summoned to the SCR, the defence party was informed that on Monday, the deadline for reading the fraud case in which Nikolai Sandakov was accused was due.
We recall that there are two criminal cases against Nikolai Sandakov.
In the first (fraud case), he is charged with a commitment for 1.5 million roubles to facilitate the appointment of the head of the administration of Lake Evgeny Tarasov as mayor of Magnitogorsk.
The second criminal case concerns the bribe that Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from the Director of the Pipton POP, Igor Kalugin, in the form of an illegal donation of at least 1.3 million roubles of property services.

The Russian copper company (RMI) is prepared to assume social responsibility and to pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that RMC has undertaken to modernize one of the oldest and most environmentally polluted enterprises in the country, the Karabash copper smelter.
The Karabash copper mill was founded by an English stock company led by Leslie Urqwart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a significant industrial enterprise for the country’s economy, and it actually provided life for an entire city.
However, in the 1990s, because of financial problems, production was halted, causing serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998, a decision was taken to resume the operation of the Karabash copper smelting plant.
One of the main problems of the Karabash plant was also to be addressed: the environmental problem.
By the early 2000s, Karabakh was already notorious as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation in Karabasmedi began to change in 2004, after the Russian copper company took over the company.
The company has begun to modernize production, which has gradually reduced the environmental burden.
This was also noted recently by Governor Boris Dubrovsky of the Chelyabin region, who visited Karabashmed in the early days of July.
The leader of the South Ural described the enormous changes that had taken place with the enterprise since Karabashmead joined the RMI group.
The main effort to modernize Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sulfuric kiln that captures up to 99.9 per cent of the metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Copper Company, Allvolod Levin, the investment in the project amounted to about 7 billion roubles.
The next phase of the modernization of the KarabashmedeZ is the reconstruction of the converter.
The replacement of three converters, dusters and gas tracts is planned for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
In addition, it is planned to launch a new 1 billion- roubles industrial wastewater treatment facility at the end of 2016.
In turn, taxes to the budget of the city of Karabakh will also increase.
The federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion roubles over the entire period of the Tomin GCO project, from the start of construction to the launch of Release 2.
And once the GCO is operational, taxes can be collected at all levels to 80.9 billion roubles.
During the year of production in the Varnen region, 346.3 million rubles were allocated to various levels of budgets.
And this is the first year.
"The longer the business works, the more the contribution can be," he added.
The RMI specified that in 2015 tax payments from the Miheev GCO approached 1 billion roubles.
However, the participation of RMI enterprises in the life and development of their territories is not limited to tax contributions.
The RMI enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, cultural and recreational facilities and areas.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian copper company in Karabash was to renovate, and in fact to restructure the N9 kindergarten almost completely by 95 students.
The building, built in 1960, was in an emergency condition.
In addition, a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and above-ground parking spaces of 600 machine rooms, cafes and sports shops will be located on RMC Arena.
RMC Arena will allow for international sporting events.
But the main objective of this project is to make exercise and sport in a comfortable environment accessible to the inhabitants of Chelyabinsk, especially children.

The Sandholm Refugee Centre in Denmark suspected that young people living there were engaged in prostitution.
This is reported by The Local on Thursday, 11 August.
According to him, some youths told the staff of the institution that “someone in Copenhagen is organizing prostitution”.
According to the publication, doubts about the shelter workers arose after the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenkan spoke of similar stories in Malma.
In 2015, a crisis broke out in the European Union because of the influx of refugees from Africa and the Middle East.
Denmark has placed over 20,000 of them on its territory.
A fisherman caught a rare blue lobster off the coast of Cape Cod, U.S.A.
The man found crustacea among the others caught in his submarine trap, reported ABC News.
The American is planning to transfer it to the local oceanium.
The Lobster weighs about a kilo.
It is noted that Wayne Nickerson has been fishing lobsters for the past 35 years.
According to his wife, for the first time in his career, a man had a blue lobster in 1990.
According to ABC News, crustaceans acquire blue or blue colors as a result of genetic changes.
In April 2016, it was reported that fishermen caught a copy of the rarest species of deep - sea sharks, Megachasma pelagios, off the coast of Japan.
A five-foot animal weighs about a ton.
The Black Sea Navy has carried out activities in the area of underwater and submerged defence in the Black Sea.
This was reported by RIA Novosti by Igor Digalo, a spokesman of the Ministry of Defence Press Department.
The training was carried out in the first phase of the Navy Special Forces Training.
“Armed personnel of the submarine and submersible units have deployed underwater and submersible defence at the base of the fleet on the coast and the adjacent maritime area of the Black Sea”, Digalo explained.

The court in Podskovje arrested the father for the murder of the adoptive daughter: Investigation and trial: Force structures: Lenta.ru
The Lake City Court of Moscow has authorized the arrest of Roman Chernikov, who confessed to the murder of his six-year-old adopted daughter.
On Thursday, 11 August, according to the city news agency Moscow, the press secretary of the Nin Gilkin court told us about this.
“The Court granted the request of the investigating authorities for a two-month preventive measure against Chernikov”, she said.
Chernikov will be under arrest until 9 October.
On 11 August, SCR Moscow reported that the adoptive parents and grandmothers of a six-year-old girl had confessed to her murder.
In particular, Roman Cernikov reported that he had killed a child on one of the days of April 2016 from a personal hostile relationship while at home under the influence of alcohol.
Then, in order to hide the child’s body, he burned it and scattered the remains along with his wife in a large square.
On the evening of 9 August, during an interrogation with the investigator, the adoptive parents reported that a six-year-old child had drowned in a bathtub in April 2016.
They had been able to hide the disappearance of the girl for a long time, but in August, when they learned that they were about to be visited by the care authorities, they decided to tell everyone that the child was missing.
On 6 August, their parents claimed that their adopted daughter had left the area of the home where they lived and disappeared.

The pensioner turned the ladder into a budget beach tower.
Network users laughed at the pictures of an elderly man installing a ladder on the beach and turning it into a spring for jumping into water.
The picture was published on several entertainment portals, as well as on a group called "My Taganrog" on Vkontakte Social Network, which led many to believe that the photograph was taken on the shores of the Azov Sea.
In the comments, "innovation" was referred to as "budget tower" and "mobile tramlin".
Many commended the man for his ingenuity and "smart" and some noted that the man was at serious risk of getting hurt when jumping off his tower because he had set it at a low depth.
However, one of the commentators on the Pikabu portal noted that it was not possible to judge the depth of the sea by photography.
"First, we don't know what depth there is, the beach can be a sprinkle with a sharp descent by one metre right behind the stairs, and secondly, even if it's a meter deep, with the right ability to jump from a couple of meters," wrote the user under the name C0JIBAMDJZ
At the same time, the Italian edition of Roma Today states that a man with a ladder was seen on a beach near Rome.

The French city of Canna has been banned from visiting local beaches in a burkini, a special bathing suit for women that completely covers the body from head to ankles.
This is reported by ABC News on Friday, 12 August.
Mayor Kann David Lysnar explained that such clothing “does not conform to the rules of decency, secularism and hygiene and safety”.
He also said that clothing, which emphasized religious affiliation, could cause disturbances of public order.
A fine of 38 euros (about $42) was imposed for the wearing of burkini.
It is noted that the ban was imposed against the background of the terrorist attacks that took place on 15 July in Nice and on 26 July in the church of St. Etienne du Ruvre in the north of the country.
Since its introduction, several Muslim women have appealed to the courts, claiming that restrictions violate the right to freedom of religion.
The Charity City Court (Amor oblast) sentenced the former head of the city, Alexander Migulu, to nine years of general-regime colony.
This is reported on Friday, 12 August, on the court's website.
Migulu was found guilty of the offences set out in articles 286 (“Excess of authority”), 285.1 (“Non-earmarked expenditure of budgetary resources”) and 285 (“Abuse of official powers”) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
The investigation found that in December 2008, the official had provided his familiar land in the village of Muhinka in violation of the land law procedure.
In 2006, it illegally ordered the town to acquire a road bridge across the Chigiri River at an overpriced price without competitive procedures and a municipal contract, and Interfax explains.
In addition, between 2007 and 2010, Migula changed the schedule of payments under the contract for the sale of a land lease that had been provided for the construction of housing and exempted the company from rent in the interest of a commercial organization under its control.
As a result, more than 5 million roubles were underfunded, and the city's treasury was about 21 million roubles.
On 4 August, it was reported that the former mayor, who was detained on suspicion of corruption and who had claimed a deputy mandate, had failed to provide a signed ballot for the elections to the State Duma on time and had been removed from the election.
Migulya was detained in May 2015 in Lipetsk oblast and detained in SIZO.
Prior to that, he had been wanted internationally since 2011.
Alexander Migula served as Mayor of Blagovetschensk from November 2004 to April 2010.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Thailand was accused of bombing in the resorts of local sabotagers.
The bombings in Thailand's resorts are “local sabotage” and are not linked to the activities of international terrorists.
According to Reuters, the Thai police reported this.
According to the police guard, they have not yet been able to determine whether the explosions are related to each other.
Basically, their planners tried to disrupt the tourist season.

The holders of messaging and postal services must identify users and remove prohibited information - this is the brief content of the draft law drafted by the Media Communications Union (MSU), which brings together the largest Russian telecommunications operators (with the Vedostos).
The staff of the three member companies confirmed that such a project was under discussion.
In early autumn, it should be presented to the working group under the leadership of First Vice-Prime Minister Igor Skholov, speaking to the "Memorials" interlocutor at the ISS.
These are amendments to the communications and media laws.
They provide that any “Internet disseminater that allows for the exchange of electronic messages” is required to identify users on the basis of information contained in the databases of communication operators, pre-contracting with them.
As well as “promptly block messages or publications that contain information disseminated in violation of the requirements of Russian law”.
Otherwise, operators may restrict access to the service as decided by Roskomnadzor.

WSJ: The US is considering imposing sanctions against the Russian Federation because of the hacking of Democrat servers.
U.S. officials are considering imposing new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of Democratic Party servers, writing The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
In order to impose sanctions, US President Barack Obama’s administration is reported to have to formally accuse Russia’s servers or Russian-backed hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other United States intelligence agencies are almost certain of Russia's involvement in cyberattacks.
WSJ notes that the U.S. usually prefers not to name hackers.
The exception is the 2014 hacking of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, for which the DPRK was officially responsible.
However, last year Obama issued a decree simplifying the imposition of sanctions on those who carry out or facilitate cyber attacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be lengthy, writing.
Even if officials had concluded that the hackers had acted with Russia’s support, they would have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose the information.
They have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
It was previously reported that the Obama administration allowed sanctions to be imposed against a State whose hackers had hacked into the Democratic Party National Committee servers.
WikiLeaks published an e-mail to the National Committee of Democrats.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in the hacking.
In the Kremlin, such reports were described as absurd.
FAS fined Google for almost half a billion rubles.
The reason was the disruption of competition in the mobile applications market.
The antimonopoly proceedings were initiated by Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google provided smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited pre-installing applications from other developers, such as Yandex.
FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company abused market dominance and forced mobile manufacturers to install other applications along with Google Play.
On the basis of the audit, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, reporting to FAS deputy leader Alexei Dozenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that all companies, including transnational corporations, must comply with the competition law.
Google, in turn, intends to study the solution first, and only then will it be determined with further action: to execute it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service found the company to be in breach of the competition law as early as September last year and ordered the contract to be adjusted until 18 December.
However, Google did not agree.
Since then, the company and the agency have been conducting judicial proceedings.
The FAS noted that despite the fine, they were discussing with Google the possibility of a settlement agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
A leading analyst, Mobile Research Group, Eldar Murtasin, expressed this opinion.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would have no effect on the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.
The Waljani rented an apartment and then stole it for 84,000 rubles.
The stolen household equipment was sold by a 30-year-old robber.
As told to KM correspondent in Volgograd in the press service of the regional government of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, a member of the satellite city submitted a report of the robbery to the Volga police station the previous day.
The man told the law keepers that an unknown man rented his apartment.
When the owner visited his home, he found it completely empty — no washing machine, no television, no refrigerator, or the tenant himself.
The total amount of damage was 84,000 roubles.
Soon, the guards came to the mark of the thief.
They turned out to be a 30-year-old unemployed Magician.
The man was detained and confessed, informing him that the stolen property had already been sold.
He would now have to be held accountable for theft in the strictness of the law, and criminal proceedings had been instituted against the detainee.
This year, the Crimean population will receive a notice for the payment of the transport tax.
The people of the peninsula will now pay taxes on land, property and transportation.
The head of the Federal Tax Administration for RC, Roman Naszhčev, announced this at a press conference.
By the end of 2016, Crimean car owners will be notified for payment of the transport tax.
So far, the IRS has counted about 250,000 motor vehicle owners.
Tax payers will be provided by HICD, Rosreester.
“If, as of the first January, we are informed of the owners of real estate and landowners, the following year Crimea citizens will be the taxpayers of these taxes,” said Roman Nazzzhjev.
Allowances for property taxes, especially for pensioners, will be granted for preferential categories of citizens.
Also under the land tax, there is a system of deductions depending on the tax payer's preferential category, but according to the head of the FSN, it is premature to say so before 2017.

The Anime effect of Snapchat is criticized as a cartoon for Asians.
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some commentators say it's racially insensitive.
Using the lens tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and to play with individuality in ways that border absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character to frame Roy Liechtenstein's painting.
The lenses are rough, twisting features of tools that create more than 30 million adjusted selfies a day.
Any mistakes quickly become common knowledge.
The Snapchat lenses were criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising the dark skin of the face or promoting white faces as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week, which gave them curvature eyes, crooked teeth, and thick cheeks, some critics considered it to be a racist cartoon for Asians, the yellow faces.
And they wondered whether these repeated contradictions pointed to the company’s more serious diversity problem.
On Wednesday, news reports and indignation followed in reporting on The Verge and Motorboard, the day after Snapchat claimed to have removed this function.
The company commented that the lens was designed as a respect for the characters of anime, not as a cartoon for Asians.
But for experts who know about racism, the lens reminded them of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with anime.
In an e-mail from Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet of photos was actively shared, she said that the lens was "intimidating and at least awkward."
She added that "it was hard to argue with comparisons of a very rough cartoon on Asians and filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow, but highly demeaningly yellow.
Snapchat is not the only company that passes through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, from the corporate conference rooms to Hollywood and the deveys that we all carry.
And a huge audience of young people in Snapchat -- who are more racially diverse than their older generation -- can mean that they're more likely to expect to understand.
When one of the Snapchat lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katy Joo said, "It's much harder to stay unnoticed than it used to be."
On Thursday, Joo, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to remove her account from Snapchat and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed that racial contradictions caused a lack of diversity in recruitment in Snipchat.
Zhu was criticized mainly by the white management of the company, composed of only men, and ended her article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu, who herself is an American Chinese-born woman, wrote: “They did not have enough non-white people in the state to make such decisions, or they do not have white people, but they do not hold positions in which they can speak safely and openly.”
Other observers share her view, expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, highlighting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of its staff, but according to the trustee, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented segments of the population and to actively seek domestic resources.
For her part, Zhu said that she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us so they can tell us that this isn't going to work."
Military leadership distorted ISIL intelligence, reports to Congressional Commission
The U.S. Central Command changed the intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the situation on the ground warrants, reported to the Congressional Commission in a report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the task force established by the Republican Chairmans of the House of Representatives Committee on Military Affairs, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Appropriations found “broad widespread dissatisfaction” among the analysts of the Central Command Intelligence Service who claimed that the leaders had misdirected them into assessing American actions aimed at winning the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the chief military agency in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Intelligence documents approved by Centcom High Command tended to provide a more optimistic picture of U.S. counter-terrorism action, as evidenced by the actual facts from the scene, and were stablely more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies”, said the news release on the report.
“What happened in Centcom is unacceptable: when the highest leadership is presented with unreliable analysis, our military suffers,” said a member of the House of Representatives, Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
Management problems in Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report deals in detail with the persistent shortcomings that arose in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain definitive evidence that Obama’s management ordered the falsification of the reports, it argues that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIL.
“In the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, statements and testimonies of the Central Command of Congress were much more optimistic than real events”, reported the report.
For example, Centcom officials publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is certainly known," said House of Representatives member Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest leadership of the U.S. Central Command Intelligence Service forged command intelligence documents to minimize the threat posed by ISIL in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a task force when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed data.
An additional, unfinished investigation into Centcom intelligence is being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Representatives of the Democratic Party on the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress published their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
“During 2014 and 2015, the Centcom set up an overly closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments concerning ISIL and the Iraqi security forces”, states in a statement by a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, the main representative of the Democratic Party on the committee.
This procedure, according to Šiff, “stopped the issuance of intelligence documents”, damaged the morale of analysts and “not sufficiently reflected diverging views”.
But Shiff and the Democrats claim that they found no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom analysts to fit their findings into a “triggered or political interpretation”.
The preliminary results of the Congress's investigation were presented on Tuesday at The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector of the Pentagon following complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congress report while the Chief Inspector was still investigating.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree in the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital topics relating to national security”.
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether American bombings in Iraq and Syria (as more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence now claim) reach their targets.
But last year’s statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide accurate assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism over the Islamic State echoes the controversy that took place more than a decade ago when an intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article claiming that President George Walker W. Bush’s administration, because of the protest of many analysts, was in favour of a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest caused by intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, officials said that Hooker’s team had concluded that, despite public claims to the contrary, the bombing of oil refineries belonging to the Islamic State had not led to a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary oil refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not distributed outside the Central Command, as the Times reported in September.
The then Commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate, which many deputies considered to be overly optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by the Central Command of Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The US wins four consecutive times in women's grass hockey, bringing it closer to a decisive battle with Britain.
Once three goals in a game that ended with a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam opened the score on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's hockey team on the grass, when the Americans won the 3-0 team of India.
Five heads in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, who is 27 years old, says she's not sure if she'd ever done something like that.
"I don't know," she said.
I'm not really the kind of person who's tracking their goals.
Here's what she knows: Americans 4-0 at the Olympic tournament, and they compete for first place in their band with Britain, which remains invincible after Japan's 2-0 score on Thursday.
The British and U.S. teams will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams claim a quarter finale, and the game will determine who will be the first in their group of six teams and who will be the second.
The winner will avoid meeting a strong team of Dutch rivals, the leaders of another group, in a little bit of time when the quarterfinals play.
However, Saturday's game shows that the Americans here made a noise in their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time, taking a field hockey club when she was three (her older twin sisters played this sport in Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she didn't make the finals.
Then it came to 2012, when things didn't work out between her and her teammates.
The following year, Koyg Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, physical change," Bam said.
In London, we didn't have the productivity that we have right now.
We've completely changed our minds.
On Thursday night, Bam opened an account in the first half of the game with an uncomfortable hand at a short distance.
India approached the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly rigid and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative into his own hands.
She made a long pass with the ball down on the left side of the field, then went into the middle of the spiral and sent the ball into the gate sharply, giving Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The dry victory was the first in the United States goalkeeper's tournament, Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's hit.
So did Bam.
"We're in a good position right now," Parnham said, "but how good it depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
In the midst of the violence of the Olympic Games, the "Day" jumps on the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio appear to be constant and inevitable, and this is a rabid combination of competition and ambition.
It's like the Olympic fire itself is the burning torch that goes from the archer to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triatlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or eavesdropping your neighbors' conversations in turn at the cafe, and not hear about Simon Bayles, Katie Ledeki, or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who first competes in the Olympic Games, a handsome man with holes on his cheeks, could well be among those celebrities that are shown in prime time promoted by sponsors and life-promoting commercials if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even a fencer.
But 28-year-old Dooley, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline race.
The Olympic fire does not cover all events in the same way.
Far from the center, partly in the shadows, there are sports that are not generally recognized: shooting with a pneumatic gun, onions, badmintons, Taekwondos.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I'm allowed to speak shyly in defence of my personal addiction, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of jumping on the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumps have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many of the people I interviewed have not been aware that they are all Olympic sports.
It could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won medals in trampoline jumps, and their athletes did not enter the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share male awards, while Chinese and Canadians share female awards.
Dun Dun from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But trampoline jumps have an outsider charm, particularly because for an uninformed ear, they are more associated with circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here, I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just a grounded enthusiast.
They do have a comical potential -- a cartoon flash of endless jumps -- but also the grace of gymnastics and water jumps, the two sports that they basically combine.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trapolín", which means "a jump in the water."
The contestants jump on a giant trampoline, flying about 30 feet into the air, and have to perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends, and saltos) until the final landing on their feet.
They are evaluated by execution, complexity, and flight time, according to the official Olympics programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is forward.
The candidates for the medal must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth, across the field.
They seek not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in view of television cameras, another frightening frontier: the world record or the Olympic record.
It's a noble, admirable, even fanatical pursuit — and it's enough to make even the audience cry.
But it's, in my opinion, a bit exhausting when you watch the Games.
He's giving you a break from jumping on a trampoline.
The direction of the trampoline is upwards.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps up, seems weightless, like an astronaut, flying up, then down, then without effort, up again.
And they're not without competition or difficulty, but throughout the program, there's no crazy zeal for the finish, no long jumps, just a strange, elegant disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the closest thing to an Olympic event.
Women's qualification competitions, followed by the finals on Friday afternoon, broadcast at 1 o'clock on Eastern European time; men's on Saturday, also at 1 o'clock.
The NBC will broadcast the finals as part of the day programme from 2:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected that can easily be seen in the general landfill.
And if consciousness growth can only be achieved by embracing male athletes with prestigious views and lenses — as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested to male hymnists from the United States — Dooley is waiting for his new admired crowd of fans.
"The Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia faced violent opposition from the Government.
Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were fatally injured during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of splitting up?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country, extending to an increasing number of its territories.
In the last week alone, thousands of people went to the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s reaction was brutal.
Witnesses claimed that police officers had shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos from the protest sites, allegedly taken at the end of the past or earlier this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Africa Horn project in an international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
The American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably, even with a new suburban train in Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia has hardly been a model of democracy — human rights organizations have consistently referred to government repression — opposition in the territory of the State has been suppressed by the fact that dissidents have actually been silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or exiled to remote deserts.
But it can change.
"If people are constantly suppressed and left with no other option but to protest, there will be a rebellion," said Seyoum Teshoma, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints ranged from land use to the takeover of power by a government coalition.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the government party and its allies completely displaced the opposition and now control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea have increased; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Front for the Liberation of Oromo or the Front for the National Liberation of Ogaden, may try to exploit unrest and re-arm themselves.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, which have been boiling deep for several years, are now on the rise.
The first seems completely harmless: smartphones.
In the past few years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace and Internet services have improved.
Even when the government shuts down Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find it possible to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this was how they organized themselves for protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Throughout the centuries, Amhara from predominantly Christian highlands in Ethiopia flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in low-lying areas.
But it's also changing.
"We will work together under a unified command," said Mulat Hemem, leader Oromo.
The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have foreseen danger.
Analysts claim that he was particularly skilled in detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using spies to extract data and neutralize the opponents.
“The present regime lacks common sense”, said Abdi, an analyst in conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Dessalin, appeared out of nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he doesn't have the confidence of the security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that this will result in more bloodshed.
For the last time, Ethiopia experienced such upheavals in 2005, after thousands of people protested that, according to analysts, there appeared to have been elections that the Government had blocked and then forged the results.
In the ensuing repression, many Protestants were killed, albeit in fewer numbers than in the last months, and this period of unrest went relatively quickly.
Development experts expressed appreciation to Ethiopia ' s leaders for the visionary development of infrastructure, such as the new long-distance train and the significant progress made in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the growing internal dissatisfaction of the Ethiopian Government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondara, the city of Amhar, attacked the Tigray businesses, and anti-Tigray hatred on social media becomes comprehensive.
Analysts claim that the protesters have put the United States and other Western allies in an uncomfortable position.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already fragile region.
"And this stretched rope will be hard to get through," said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIL was founded by Obama, "sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to cover up the last conflict that covered his election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when he claimed several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State's terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to address the American people with caution.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during a period of unrest, in an awkward position, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
After making this assumption at the convention on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his approval on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton founded ISIL.
But in a Twitter post early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just sneaking around.
This post was in direct contrast to the statement made only a day earlier, when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When Radio Conservator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his speech, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIL, the presidential candidate from the Republican Party did not take the opportunity.
The latest scandal occurred when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy against the background of declining ratings.
Trump and Clinton gave competing speeches on the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to come back to the subject.
Again using Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would increase taxes, and he said that he found her speech boring.
Trump used sarcasm as an excuse before.
At the end of July, after he had brought public criticism into his mind, almost expressing the idea that the Russians should hack Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his remarks, saying, "Of course I'm kidding."
This approach allows Trump to go beyond permissible political speech and to take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way to test some of the messages that are responding among his fans, to see how they work, and then to "explain" them in one direction or another, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his remarks and knows that they're vague enough to be interpreted differently.
Instead of softening statements for a broad electorate, Trump has taken an even more sarcastic tone in recent days, while his ratings continue to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that Trump was giving way to Clinton, with a high margin in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and was at the same level in Florida.
Although Trump tends not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpretation of his words and misunderstanding of his sense of humor.
But as Trump has received increased attention in the recent months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, who is one of Trump's most famous deputies, has made a serious effort to protect the candidate in an interview given by CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," said Giuliani, when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIL was an almost unknown little organization, he called it a non-threatening, totally unfair, and that's why it happened because it withdrew troops from Iraq.
Most of the average Republicans claim that the Obama administration, in which Clinton held the post of Secretary of State, allowed ISIL to develop because it failed to resolve the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the media for mutilating and biasing every word he says.
He mocked poor, unhappy TV experts who were trying to solve it, and said, "They're weak!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump’s excuses as an unnecessary confirmation that he was not fit for president.
The once-chanched coffee shop is back in Greenpoint.
Verb's coffee shop was full of cash in Williamsberg, which did not have Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was pushed out of her room with a window on Bedford Avenue.
Soup Sheri, which took the place of Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in the new city.
Molly Krabaple's artist tweeted, "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is ruined, and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, being updated.
The reborn Verb coffee shop opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original site.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and takes credit cards, but there are some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
Besides, coffee's still good.
The new Verba is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new place, he said he'd be happy to do it.
Rodriguez, who is 36 years old, left a lot of the same.
Verb works with the same bagels distributor and bought the same coffee machine model.
It even has chandeliers from the old Verba.
But Rodriguez said he'd also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu presents bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches, and there are capers or fried onions.
There are brown rice dishes.
There's no more beer at the coffee shop, but they're making freshly pressed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said that he had noticed the constant flow of old regulars.
"Many ex-clients have been pushed out of Williamsberg too," he shared.
Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients on a recent Sunday.
Oliveira, who was 34 years old, used to live in Williamsberg and often visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she went there anyway.
After Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized it was coffee and atmosphere that impressed me in Verbe," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, although that day instead of the regular ice coffee, she ordered a cup of tea, another new one.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-standing client, attended Verb loyally since 2003.
He stopped by before work and ordered the same thing all the time.
"At 15 o'clock, every day, like clockwork, I came, and my bagel with oil and all the fillings was prepared for me," he said.
Rodriguez told me that he wanted to experiment and put new dishes on the menu.
Rosenthal is still doing the usual order today, but one day he'll change something with bacon, eggs, or cheese on a bagel with all the fillings.
Rodriguez said he wasn't offended by the fact that the soap shop once took over the old place.
Moreover, Soup Sherry's owners proposed that special soap be made for Verb, using coffee from a coffee shop prepared coldly as an ingredient.
"I think we might agree to their offer," said Rodriguez.
The permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also enjoyed the coffee shop.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the window to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has other benefits.
The local juice sales point plans to spill bottles and sell cold coffee.
There's a possibility that the coffee shop will join the next building.
For many clients, it's enough that the new Verb will put their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client and told me that he was saddened when they closed down.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Whitt said that when he went inside and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
"How long I've wanted to smell this scent," he confessed.
Depressive depressive meals at the Float Dinner.
In March 1933, shortly after taking up the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt liked the fancy Fifth Avenue dishes, such as foie gras and Meriland turtle soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato mashed potatoes, and pudding pudding from prunes for dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to feed."
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in food history.
Coha's last book, "Rage in Chinese", was devoted to Chinese food in America, and Siegelman told the story of life in a rental apartment in the Lower East Side through food in her book "The House 97 on Fruit Garden Street."
Their new joint work, "The Planet", to be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the history of American food in the Great Depression.
In some measure of their own cooking solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, simple diner in Flatairtown, which has been operating since 1929, the year of the market collapse.
Siegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with olive slices, and Coe, 57, took turkey, potato mashed potatoes and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meat loaf, the couple considered it a suitable starting point for discussion about food in the Depression era.
"The roulettes were in great demand," said Siegelman.
There was peanut roll, liver roll, bean roll.
They were made of a basic ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to be stretched.
Imagine eating as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coy's wrinkled.
"It must have been a stone in his stomach," he said.
During the years before Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women cooked for male farm workers, and fresh baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult subject for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as complicated was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes, such as rolls and pancakes, became basic foods; baking is a "precious way to dispose of scraps," noted Siegelman, because cooks could hide non-appetitary ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
The meat, which has been the foundation of American food for many years, has become economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even cooking common sense.
In research for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of that age: baked onions filled with peanut butter.
"This addition to the dinner table was not a success," Coe said.
Siegelman added, "That was very strange."
Peanut butter doesn't fit the liver onion at all.
This was common in many home-based recipes.
More than ever since, homemakers — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Economics Bureau, from 1923 to 1943 — have managed the country’s food habits.
By publishing prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “contributors of the budget,” to accept the challenge and to transform a burde like protetic spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
"Pilot meal" is a banquet of curious historical facts.
The government's reaction to starving citizens, for example, President Herbert Hoover's "let's eat pies" attitude is particularly picky.
Publicly exalted by a simple farmer's cooking in the state of Iowa during his childhood, he was eating like a sophisticated millionaire he became.
"He liked the continental kitchen, like fish with cucumber sauce," he said.
He ate practically in a gold dining room wearing a tux.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was completely uninterested in taste, and this led the White House to “use not only the most depressing food in Washington, D.C., but sometimes the most disgusting food prepared.”
Many of the culinary techniques of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country was back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrients, says Siegelman, and how science was used in cooking.
The couple tell us that during the writing of the book, they understood better the eating habits of their mother Zegelman — that she could not throw away food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being negligent about food," he said.
Siegelman recalls, "She really poisoned people."
There's been an unpleasant case of profilers.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were empty, he and Coe got the dessert that they made at home: the pruning dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called pruning mousse," said Siegelman, adding that it was a common technique to give modest recipes brocade names.
There was no whipped cream, just pruning, a little flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly put the spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe asked for more twice.
In the voice of a confident budget maker, he said to his wife, "A little ruble walnuts would be nice."
Arrest of figures in the Hovan Cemetery Mass Fight case extended until 14 November
The Presnian court left the case of a mass fight at the Cemetery of Khovan on 14 November under arrest, granting the request of the investigation.
There are 14 accused in the case.
On 14 May, several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus fought in the Khovan Cemetery with weapons, killing three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yuri Chabouev, and a lawyer, co-founder of the public organization Health Nation, Alexander Bocharnikov, have been charged with organizing the murder.
The second indexation of pensions in 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on 12 August by the Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Olga Hungerec, during a visit to the Brjansk region.
We have specific parameters as to how much a pension needs to be raised to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
The economists are now taking stock of the six months, and we will complete this work in the next two to three weeks,” quotes the Interfax Hungershop.
Commenting on the six-month scheme proposed by the head of the Strategic Development Centre, Alexei Kudrin, to raise the retirement age for six months each year, the Vice-Prime Minister reported that the Kabmin did not consider the topic.
At the end of July, it was reported that the Government had agreed on a position to fully index pension benefits in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigorian entered the finals of the small-calibre rifle shooting competition.
Russian athletes Sergey Kamensky and Cyril Grigorian entered the finals of the small-calibre rifle shooting competition from the Brazilian Olympic Games.
According to TASS, Sergey Kamenski scored 629 points and ranked first, a new Olympic record.
Cyril Grigorian became the second, 628.9 was.
There were eight top athletes in the finals.
Kamensky is the world record in this discipline (633).
Turkish opponent Fathullah Gülen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup d ' état in Turkey.
“I demand an independent international commission to investigate an attempted coup d'état”, quotes the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition also stated that “if any part of the charges were confirmed, I would return to Turkey”.
Gülen, however, denies any involvement in the State party, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
The Istanbul court had previously arrested in absentia the opposition Islamic preacher Fathullah Gülen.
We recall that the military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of 15 to 16 July.
Gilead companies will reimburse the costs of legal services during the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc. has the right to receive reimbursement for the costs of legal services it has incurred in connection with a patent claim against hepatitis C with the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc., which was ordered by a federal district judge.
In June, Gilead was released from paying $200 million in damages for the violation of two Merck patents related to Gilead's drugs, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after an American judge discovered a number of violations by Merck, including sworn lies and other unethical acts.
On appeal to the court on Thursday, U.S. Federal District Court judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead had the right to recover the costs incurred in challenging the claim.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of liver patients.
This occurred in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work at the heart of the sophosbuvir, an active ingredient of Gilead's drugs.
United States-supported armed forces claim to have intercepted complete control of Manridge from the Islamic State.
The United States-supported armed forces took full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters left the city on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now cleaning up the city after the remaining group of fighters who were hiding in the city has left.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages who were held by militants and told Reuters by Charfan Darwish of the Allied Military Council of Manbridge with the VTS.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we're doing clean-up operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, which showed that the Democratic Party presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charity contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about 5.3 million in performance fees, and the former Secretary of State announced an income of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the Department of State.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife, Anna Holton, released tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard for financial transparency," said electoral counsellor Clinton Jennifer Palmieri.
Quite the contrary, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and breaking his past promises to release his tax returns.
It's a common case for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers named the State Tax Service's audit as a reason for his refusal to disclose his tax returns.
"Your move," tweeted Clinton Jan Sams, campaign manager, referring to the Democratic Party candidate's declaration.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trump, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the end of the checks.
Critics of Trump, including a presidential candidate from the Republican Party in 2012, Mitta Romney and other Republican fellowmen, said that his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other links, including with Russia.
Clinton took hold of the question and released an online video on Friday, which focused on outstanding Republicans who persuaded Trump to release tax reports.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during a talk about economics in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every single presidential candidate has done for decades: to publish his tax returns," she said to the assembly.
Politico reported that Trump had not paid any or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a business columnist in the New York Times quoted many tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who thought that things might still be the case.
The federal tax rate was the subject of a debate in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after a billionaire, an investor named Warren Buffett, that would guarantee that people who received more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he's also under IRS testing, and Trump's "afraid" not of tax agencies, but of voters.
Clinton's campaign headquarters issued tax returns until 2007.
Clinton, now living in Chapaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective aggregate tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The 2015 Clinton Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was a source of wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index seed fund, and the Clintons announced dividends and capital revenue of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks enhance the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania use a non-conventional way to prevent elephants from entering localities by throwing chili powder-filled condoms into them.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with this idea a few years ago, along with the United States Nature Conservation Committee, took over its promotion by training volunteers in northern Tanzanian villages to use a non-violent, four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, a lot of people used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we've invented a set of tools ... we've seen a change in attitudes within these communities, so they're much more confident that they'll be able to keep elephants out of their fields without harming elephants," said executive director Honeyguide Damien Bell.
The first two steps are to light a torch before an elephant breaks the border and to signal with a horn.
If he couldn't be scared off, they're throwing away the so-called chili cloud.
Chili powder mixed with soil is placed with a cotton in a condom, and its end spins, and there's only a wick outside.
When a condom is ignited, it bursts with a roar, spraying small dust of chili powder in the air.
One blow is usually enough to turn the elephant in the other direction.
The ultimate measure is a launcher that fires Roman candles into the air, making a loud, bright explosion.
To date, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey, who left the country after an attempted coup d ' état last July.
This information was given by the head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mevlut Chavushoglu, in an interview with local journalists.
In the first phase, we withdrew 208 personnel diplomats to continue working at the centre.
Of these, 32 have not returned without objective reasons and explanations”, said the head of the Turkish foreign policy department.
Let us recall that a coup d'état was attempted in Turkey in July.
The authorities have officially declared that the State party has failed and have reported the detention of more than 6,000 people, including senior and middle-level military officers.
According to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 290 people died as a result of the coup d ' état.
The Jewish director critically criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's telephone code on the Arab "request", reported RT News.
The French director of Jewish origin has caused a media scandal, finding that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli telephone code on its list, and employees refer to “requests” from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoa", expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lantzman Hotel, he tried to locate Israel on the hotel's telephone code list.
The country, however, had not been mentioned among the States to which you could call directly from the room.
How could it be that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was expelled and eradicated?
He wrote Lantzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this issue at the hotel administration's desk.
The answer he received there, according to Lanzman, was "shocked him."
The hotel clerk said that this measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski Hotel Network."
The reason behind this move caused the director to get even more angry.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel's code be deleted," said Lanzman, a hotel servant.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handellsman, described the case as “a terrible shame”, reports Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
The fact that it happened in Germany and in this network of hotels is even more shameful.
There's no need for explanation here.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” said the official.
The incident caused a lot of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "goes on" with the alleged demands of Arab clients.
“Shame” was said in another post where it was stated that the hotel, located on the glorious street Kurfurstendamm, was located near the synagogue.
The hotel itself has rushed to dismiss any charges, calling what happened "uninspection" and "approved" to Lanzman, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel on the rapid recruitment list," quotes the representative of the Kempinski Hotel in the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students.
The students encountered the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered to protest against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to disperse the students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
As proposed by the Governor of the State of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some protesters were seen writing graffiti on the walls against Interim President Michael Thamer.
This last protest took place just a few days after the protesters went to the streets to support President Dilma Rusef, who had been suspended, when the Senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, reports the RT Business portal
With the lifting of the sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent over the previous year, according to the Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levan Jagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran had been lifted, there was a growing interest on the part of Russian firms in business in the country, said the ambassador.
Russian companies are reconnecting with Iran, and new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Jagarian said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016 trade between Russia and Iran had increased by 70.9 per cent over the same period in 2015 to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,” the Ambassador said.
Jagaryan also forecasts a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran has entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of visitors to Russia.
It is safe to say that last year’s record of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization remain in good condition," he said.
The State has continued to roll up its tacks in the defence and industrial complex.
The reason for dismissal was the “systematic failure” of the CEO of Almas - Antey, “missing in work” and “loss of trust”.
Gennady Bender has been appointed head of NGOs for the next three years.
Information about Nescorodov's dismissal only appeared on Thursday night and did not generate widespread media resonance.
How can such silence be explained in the context of the large-scale rearming of the army?
It is likely that the Russian authorities do not want to spread any rumours or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This confirms once again that the Defence and Industrial Complex (PPC) has many problems and the State does not wish to attract increased public attention to them.
The removal of Nekorodov is undoubtedly an important development in terms of order in the industry.
The NGO Almaz is the main company of the company, which specializes in the production of marine and terrestrial air defence systems.
Almaz is currently in the process of establishing the Polyment-Redut and Morphei RCA, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia portal, Dmitry Cornev, believes that the dismissal of Nescorodov is due to the disruption of the duration of the projects.
This is the most logical version.
For example, the development of Morpheus started as early as 2007 and was expected to take place in 2013.
Poliment Redut is supposed to be the main air defence system on the latest Navy ships.
According to the information I'm getting, in a few years of testing, no real success has been achieved.
The truth is, as far as I can tell, there's no clear fault of "Almaza," said Cornev.
The expert fears that a delay in entry into service may also occur with the “C-500” RCA.
The pilot design of the project has not yet been completed, but the first complexes are expected to enter the force during 2016.
In the Ministry of Defence, “the work is planned and everything will be completed within the established time frame”, although in 2014 the agency acknowledged the problems with the development of the P-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Nescorodov, who led Almasm since 2011.
The Cornev noted that project delays could be both a cause and a cause of dismissal.
In his view, it had become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in the PKK and business management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and large amounts of money are known to love silence.
Directors of defence companies usually resign from positions of their own choosing, under an agreement between the parties, or are transferred to other jobs.
In the present case, the suspension took place in public, although it was not resonant.
This suggests that the leader of Almasa may have been a figure of stoutness and resisted the "disarmament" coming down on top.
It appears that the State is no longer willing to tolerate such conduct.
It will remove those who prefer to argue with the Ministry of Defence and fail to carry out their tasks with the hands of the shareholders.
At the same time, the management of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the crooked managers (the shipmen of the Star).
The President himself has placed greater emphasis on the issues of the sector.
Vladimir Putin chairs the Military Industrialization Commission and holds periodic re-arming meetings.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of the PKK managers in an effort to have a loyal number of directors who will comply with orders from the top.
This is far from an ideal policy, but in the face of corruption and lack of normal competition in the PKK, the State has no other instruments.
The current defence situation is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical environment encourages the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces to order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleaning” of managers in the PKK, the Russian leadership has taken very successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The army has acquired a new quality with the assumption of the post of Minister of Defence, Sergey Shoigu.
It seems that the president has adopted a famous saying, "If you want peace, prepare for war."
During the cold war, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which established Moscow’s sphere of influence on the continent.
With all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked well.
The absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East proved that.
The celebration of the “winners” in the cold war eventually led to the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States, there seems to be no quiet corner left in the civilized world.
Despite the common trouble, the West refuses to speak to Russia as an equal partner.
Under such circumstances, the fleet and the army remain the only allies of our country.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to better defend national interests and to enter the new frontiers of world politics.
The Scotsman Callum Skinner runs on the finish line, and the British take bicycle gold.
The Scotsman Callum Skinner raced to a triumph in a male command sprint on a bicycle in Rio last night, and the British command trio defended its title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old son of Glasgow was the strongest man his Scots friend, Sir Chris Hoy, made his own, and the young man proudly entered the history, rushing through the finish line to take the victory out of the foreman team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed the right to win unexpectedly four years ago, winning when Hoy declared the right to the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly with the sixth at the March World Championship in London, despite the fact that Hoy had since graduated from his career.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff.
They did it just when the Hindes showed up.
Joy's departure also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man held by British coaches who saw the potential in the Scots that was now realized.
Hindes, Kenny, the champions with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner set the Olympic record, but the norm was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British Trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was exactly behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner backed up.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation where Hindes was driving in a bigger gear to slow down and let Kenny and, in particular, Skinner keep up the pace.
Hoy watched from his seat as an invited BBC expert and caught Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes looking when they entered the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "This is a flattering comparison."
I'm here to do everything I can to make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes deliberately fell on the track after a failed start.
He later rejected the comment, and there was no way to appeal from British competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the podium."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We've been losing so many world-name races that winning the Olympics again was amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for a country that won seven of the 10 races in both Beijing and London.
If this is the barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the bike is waiting for five more successful days.
With the shape shown by Kenny, it is not beyond the opportunity to imagine how he repeats the feat of Joy by winning three Olympic gold medals in the same Games.
This would make it possible to see Kenny — who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 – a sacred date in British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister’s birthday — bring his account to six gold medals and one silver medal.
It'd be just like Hoy's.
Next time, Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You're coming to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
He said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he's got to get knighthood."
It was the only medal prank of the day, but there was the next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull are qualified as the fastest four-kilometre team race in pursuit.
They finished at 3:51.943.
The world record for winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and finals (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be at the centre of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualification race, when officials demanded that he measure his weight.
At the relevant women's event, which is resumed and concluded tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsel Shend, Eleanor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgawi have improved the world record by showing the time of 4:13.260.
The UK team has come to rely on a powerful cyclist team to own the average season of the Olympics and to earn a lot of medals.
In fact, after exceptional demonstrations of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations were weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas in the second place, not the last, leaving the post of technical director Shane Sutton in April because of charges of sexism and harassment, and the departure of large figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, on the basis of the first night's bicycle race, it seems that the legendary glory of Britain now in reaching the summit at the right time may well be repeated again.
The future of the Portland metallurgy plant is threatened by the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminium factory in Victoria — as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers — is threatened by the fact that the electric power company that supplies the plant, according to one of the factory owners, is about to terminate the delivery contract: it is planned that all delivery contracts will be terminated.
This is a result of a decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
A fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs can be threatened at the Alcoa factory in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, may be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect consequences, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the steel factory at Point Henry, which resulted in the shutdown of the Englesey power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland steel factory loses money and risks closing.
These actions were the result of a reflection on the future of the plant, which has been going on for several years, initially because of the strengths of the Australian dollar and later because of the price of the plant ' s products.
AGL, which provides electricity to a large aluminium plant from its Loy Young A power plant in Latrob Wally, stated that it expected the other three owners to take steps to terminate the contracts.
The controlling share of the plant is owned by the joint short-term company Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp own less.
"The AGL company expects the Portland facility to continue operating, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop," she said.
According to AGL, these contracts are so-called “hedged contracts”, which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period of termination, so they will actually end in 2017.
"The AGL, therefore, still expects these contracts to generate their share of the revenue in FY 2017," said the electricity company.
Any potential impact on AGL’s profits since fiscal year 2018 is now limited by forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its accounts by $187 million in terms of the “future avoidance”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts “does not affect Alcoa's ability to manage the metallurgical plant or to supply electricity to the metallurgical plant”.
An American company stated that it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Young in 2010, which was due to enter into force in November this year, but had yet to explain why it had terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland metallurgy plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the unfavourable economic situation in the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier this week, AGL's Chief of Operations, Stephen Mikkelsen, said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year, while Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
For us, as a producer, it would be bad," he said.
It's not just Kardashian's reality show star, Kendall on the cover of September's Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, the model and the fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, Chris' mother manager, appeared on the wanted September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who was the face of Estee Lauder's brand and defiled it on fashion weeks in Milan, Paris, and New York, reported the news in her Instagram account on Thursday.
"When I was in the room with my favorite people, I looked at this cover and cried," Kendall wrote.
The cover was accompanied by strange news (or just in the spirit of the Kardashian Family?) prepared by a reality video in which the entire family of Kardashian-Jenner (the Rob and Caitlin Debs, who also joined the world's favorite show-business uncle, producer of the Kardashian family, Ryan Seacrest), forgot the appearance of the sister on the cover and, at the end, a classic turnover: they were planning a surprise party.
It's a standard storyline for almost all episodes of children's television shows dedicated to their birthday (Sicrus says, "Did you think we'd forgotten you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the program at 8:00 a.m.), but Chris needed to get that fame to other girls anyway.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we certainly entered the new era of the Kardashian show.
May Kendall Kim's older sister be on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared with her husband, Kanye West, in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September edition is the most sold Vogue in the year.
The magazine, which looks more like a gift publication than a fashion magazine, attracts a huge number of advertisers. (Fashionista Portal, 615 pages from last year’s 832 - page issue, contained advertisements.)
The news of who the stars are going to get on his cover is so eagerly expected that in the last two years, photos of the magazine have merged to an official announcement.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more "signatures that work in models" on the cover than "models that are celebrities".
The Oscar Award winner and the face of Dior Jennifer Lawrence was presented on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's honor.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, whom the magazine described as an “excellent model” of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, stars of reality shows, or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner is in all these categories).
They're really talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, which appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful years of his career in connection with the release of Lemonade's album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, in view of her past television reality show star, should always have been shaky.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "fucks of the moment."
These moods were rebuilt after the news of Jenner's appearance on the Vogue cover.
But it doesn't make sense to focus on dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September Vogue.
She's a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you a ton cream from Este Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you their photos in their own subscription apps.
She sells photographs of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, maybe to still see her sister Courtney and her kids, she's on a reality TV show.
Public legal centres refuse to service 160,000 people per year
Every year, more than 160,000 least protected people are denied services in public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an impact that will further reduce funding to the already overexploited activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly older persons, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people unable to fight unjust property deprivation, etc. — have already been denied access to free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services already operating outside the limits of capacity are preparing for further reductions.
From June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The director of Queensland Public Law Centers, James Farrell, said that according to the latest census report of the National Association of Public Law Centres, thousands of people were denied a year.
Farrell said that if the Federal Government's decision was not overturned, the situation would only worsen.
"Queensland's public legal centres are constantly underfunded: that means thousands of people are denied essential services," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with uncontrollable and bankrupt debts, families who are divorced, unfairly dismissed workers -- all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands of less protected Queensland residents will have to deal with complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately cancel these cuts in funding so that people can get the assistance they need when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise the funding of free legal aid to the national average.
The time has come to pay attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and it is time for the Palascuk Government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign headquarters was sued after an officer was allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump's election headquarters was sued: the headquarters allegedly did nothing after the report that his operations director in North Carolina had threatened a staff member with a gun while they were on their way to the jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday with the State Court in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state election headquarters.
Bordini said he waited a few months for the problem to be solved internally, but he realized "it's not going to happen."
Principal Earl Phillip "smarted a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and directed a blow to Vincent's kneecap," says Bordini in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional office of the pre-election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more people had taken part in similar incidents with Phillip, and was confirmed in the appeal.
"Pistols don't have to shoot to cause harm," said Bordini in the complaint.
The lawsuit took place only two days after the Republican presidential candidate had made a fuore, telling North Carolina listeners that the “second Amendment people” — understood as possessors of weapons and their amateurs — could act if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could choose judges.
Trump's campaign headquarters said that the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not expressed support for violence.
In his complaint, Bordini seeks compensation from the electoral headquarters for negligence and Phillip for threats of physical violence, assault and moral harm.
The representative of Trump Hope Hicks is slow to respond to the request for comment.
Trying to talk to Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left election headquarters.
In response to a phone call from his consulting firm, Innovation Consulting Services, no one called back quickly.
A presidential candidate from the Republican party, Donald Trump, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For Presidency Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Supreme Court of the District of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain needs to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will also bring renaissance and prosperity not only in our localities and throughout London, but also throughout the country.
To me, that was exactly the huge advantage of Heathrow, just like it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our peoples and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympic Games have been of great benefit to Stratford and the East End.
And we'll do it again, creating opportunities for local residents and firms near Heathrow.
Only for our localities here will we create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Like London 2012, there will be those who think that Heathrow's expansion is too ambitious.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics, and that we would find ourselves in a difficult world.
Sceptics were wrong in 2012, and they'll be proven wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about it.
Like the Heathrow Olympic Games, it is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for the narrow circle.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which introduced the 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment in time and within the budget, from T5, the best-elected airport terminal for five consecutive years, to T2, built in the middle of the world's two most active airstrips.
They are now ready to provide a third runway, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The Olympic Games in London 2012 were a huge success for Britain, and I am sure that Heathrow's expansion will also be a success.
It is time for us to put the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow, ensuring our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton - Chairman of the Heathrow Council and former Commercial Attaché of Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook plays cat-and-mouse on the blocking of advertising.
For companies that make money on Internet ads, trying to bypass advertising software is a cat-and-mouse game, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced that it was going to block advertisers on its desktop version, Adblock Plus posted a blog saying that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that a desktop version of the site would change the story around its ads so that it would become more difficult for advertising blockers to recognize which parts of the page were advertising.
But Adblock now claims to have been able to bypass the new code.
In his blog publication, Adblock Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of mutual struggle between the open source advertising community and those who try to bypass it has continued since the invention of the advertising block”, and it is possible that Facebook will present its own solution in the near future.
The fact that the largest social network in the world has been engaged in a struggle is a clear indication of the extent to which advertising blockers have become a major problem for the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use advertising blockers, according to the Pagefair and Adobe study last year; almost four times as many people used such software in 2013.
Based on 1.3 billion daily active users who log on Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook’s revenue from advertising.
However, the company hunts market blockers on the desktop because mobile advertising blockers are ineffective in Facebook mobile applications for social media and Instagram, according to the representative.
However, desktop advertising is a lucrative article enough to make Facebook think that such a step is a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its “advertising” tool to give people more control over how advertising is being done.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that the new Adblock filters were disturbing, as they would also block some unreleased content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem," said Facebook in an official e-mail.
Advertising blockers are a rough tool, so instead we've focused on creating tools like Advertising to hand over control to people.
A woman moved on a Swiss highway in an episode of apparent suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman has moved several vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning in a clear suicide attempt.
The incident took place at A1 near the Morge in Canton Vaud immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a sign of despair" and she was hit by several vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
Clearly, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died right there.
Several involved drivers have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, and the police have informed them that they and others who witnessed the incident are being called upon to respond.
A criminal case was initiated, a “logical” step in this situation, and counsel, Gille Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve, stated.
However, it remains to be determined whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine," Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case — both involving a man walking in the dark on the highway — it was condemned that motorists could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of death by negligence after she hit and killed a man lying on A1 near Pyern in the night of August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and passed out on the road, heard the trial.
The court found that a female police officer — who responded to an emergency call — was driving a vehicle that was justified and that the presence of a person on the road was “exclusive and unpredictable”, the judge said.
Anyone in possession of information about the incident on Thursday near the Morge should call the police for 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have once been inhabited, as estimated by the new NASA climate model.
Scientists from the Nasov Institute for Space Research, Goddard, have developed a model for the study of the past Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and an atmosphere oversaturated with carbon dioxide, could ever have had conditions similar to that of Earth.
Scientists have previously assumed that the low rate of rotation of Venus is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a dilute atmosphere similar to the Earth and still rotate slowly.
The model also reviewed the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographic variability to create living conditions and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent of the party.
"According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus sets up its day-to-day side of the sun for almost two months at a time," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Henio in a press release.
This warms the planet's surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer acting as an umbrella that protects the planet's surface from a substantial part of solar heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which are surprisingly somewhat colder than they are today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously envisaged by planetary scientists.
Although Venus may have been inhabited once, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Her oceans evaporated and her water vapour was burned with ultraviolet radiation.
When her hydrogen went out, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- that is, Venus, as we know her today.
Researchers shared the results of their new climate model in Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is leaving the position of coach of the Avalanche team.
Patrick Roy left the position of coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey activities on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
The Executive Vice President/Chief Manager of the Colorado team, Joe Sakick, confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as chief coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey activities with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I spent a long and hard time thinking about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve that goal, the vision of the coach and the vice president of hockey must perfectly coincide with the vision of the organization.
He must also have the right to vote in making decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," said Sakik.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization, and we wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and lost playoffs for the past two years.
The Avalanche team announced an evaluation of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and was five points behind the Wild team in the struggle for the second concession road to the Western Conference.
The gatekeeper from the Hall of Fame, Roy, won four Stanley Cups, two each with Montreal Canadians and the Avalanche.
North Sea oilmen resume negotiations and suspend strike
Working strikes on oil workers ' salaries in the North Sea have been suspended, and all parties to the debate are entering a new round of negotiations, reported by the lead representatives of the parties.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil service were sporadicly organized on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and United and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve ongoing disputes”, says the joint statement.
We will hold several full-time meetings over the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of next week, to look at the problems with fresh eyes.
Trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential wage cuts of up to 30 per cent.
This year, Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contract workers working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent due to negative market tensions.
The reduction in the company ' s rates occurred after a 10 per cent reduction in the rate for contract employees working on the shore in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts would give it the space needed to overcome the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in countries with a value of 10, as it rationalized its activities as a result of its mega merger with the British power company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower prices for unpurified oil: the economic situation has deteriorated because of the decision to withdraw from the European Union in June by Britain.
A Scottish member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts that have arisen in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion for new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, contrasting with the average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of the stars in the Pleyad cluster.
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers to gather the most complete catalog of rotational speeds of the stars in the Pleyad cluster.
New data helps astronomers to understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds and how the rotational periods relate to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Louise Riball, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleyad population is 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now only reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they'll ever be.
At their peak speeds of rotation, these growing stars throw away large amounts of star wind.
By traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds act as a brake on the stars.
As the star grows older, its speed of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of known star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest speed catalog suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than smaller stars.
Fishball compares stars to dancers: larger ones make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In the ballet, we see those that rotate slowly, usually more massive, while those that rotate faster tend to be very light stars," Riball said.
Since the Pleyad cluster is so close, it is the perfect space laboratory to compare star properties with rotational speeds.
"The planetary cluster of the Pleyad provides a starting point for theoretical models of rotation of stars, both younger and older," Riball said.
We still want to learn a lot about how, where and why the stars slow down their rotational speed and hang their dancing shoes on a nail, figuratively speaking.
Riball and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the speeds of the Pleyad in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation of a group of Ukrainian sabotagers in Crimea is conducted by two departments, writing “Commersant”.
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of sabotages in Crimea.
As previously reported, a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, Evgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation, gave a confession.
According to him, he considered the chemical plant Titan in Armenia, the oil base in Feodosia, the Kerchen ferry, the gas pipeline and one of the military airfields as targets for sabotage.
Law enforcement officials believe that not all subversive partners have been apprehended.
This has led, inter alia, to the arrest of suspects in the Kiev Riyud of Simferopol, notes the publication.
Stanislav Cerchezov was the leading coach of the Russian football team.
At the meeting of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislaw Cerchezov as the main coach of the Russian football team.
The contract will last for two years, until the completion of the MM-2018.
On 11 August, the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Cherchezov as the chief coach of the Russian football team.
He is a famous footballer who used to play in Moscow Spartacus as a goalkeeper, as well as a coach with extensive experience, mentoring Russian teams such as the same Spartacus, Pearl Sochi, Terek, Amkar, Dinamo, and the Warsaw Legia, who became the winner of the country's national championship and cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cerchezov will be signed as soon as possible and will last for two years.
It is therefore incumbent on him to prepare for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikiv will be part of his training staff.
There's information that the entire coach's staff will pay 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to the media, the Russian Federation’s leadership has set Stanislaw Cerchezov’s goal of bringing Russia’s team to the semifinal and winning medals.
As the coach himself stated, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team to be a priority, and he intends to give the football players an opportunity to demonstrate themselves.
Also, according to Churchesov, he's glad that the choice came to him.
The first match led by the Russian team will be held on 31 August in Antalya, a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Recall that Leonid Slutsky had previously been the chief coach of the Russian football team, combining him with the coaching at the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation after a failed performance by the Russian national team on Euro-2016 in France.
In doing so, he took responsibility for the bad results of the team.
Embarrassed between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
Nevertheless, since independence from South Africa in 1990, that country, with a population of 2.4 million, has made tremendous strides, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success was because the Government attached great importance to education.
While people in developed countries perceive free primary and secondary education as self-evident, in many poor countries secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, Governments are often encouraged to introduce “cost-recovery” training fees.
However, in Namibia, primary education is free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also been free of charge.
The authorities are also active in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 per cent over the past 10 years.
Despite the international trend of rising inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to 1993, the Gini coefficient, a standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, that figure was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate declined from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) has also declined, from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest freedom of speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country was far ahead of the United States and other rich nations.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the Perception of Corruption Index, which is composed of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia has managed to maintain a high rate of growth.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25 per cent, less than one third of the debt level in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least by traditional methods of estimation, remains fairly high - almost 28 per cent.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS infection - almost 17 per cent of the population is infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is a higher-middle-income country, but the authorities insist that its State is in fact a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the difficulties inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The State has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
In the country, isolated nomad tribes of hunter-gatherers live in deserts, who must be integrated into modern society in one way or another, without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
This is even more difficult for Namibia: just as any other country in the world is facing the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia had not thought to give up, but it was addressing the problems it faced.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities sought to create a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
Significantly, competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap health care not only for its own citizens but also for its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia talks about building a wall that separates the country from poor and corrupt neighbours.
The Namibians realized that they did not choose their neighbours, so they decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate in sharing scarce water resources, participating in regional health projects, encouraging investment and student exchange.
Moreover, the Namibian Government had rightly reasoned that rich natural resources could easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that Namibia ' s natural wealth income needs to be invested in infrastructure and productive capacities.
They were also aware that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum profits from the sale of the country ' s resources and were reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to ensure that that was the case.
Transparency was crucial to that process, and the Government ' s strong support for freedom of expression was therefore so important.
As Head of State Hage Gaingob has pointed out, the media often say things he doesn't like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect its acquired freedoms, says the President.
Not all of Namibia ' s key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, were renewables, and the Government was making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
More than one million foreign tourists visit the country every year.
Namibia showed that even those countries that began with serious shortcomings - racism, colonialism, inequality and underdevelopment - could embark on the path to common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and emulation.
Many have heard of Varna's Gold, the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4,200 B.C.E.).
Perhaps it was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, when the Necropolis of Varnen was excavated, a fantastic amount of gold artifacts was found -- more than 3,000 total weights of six kilograms.
Only 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg were recovered from one grave known as the "43 Mobil".
However, the official status of the world’s oldest gold may soon move on to the unseen bead found by archaeologists in July this year.
Again in Bulgaria, a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunacite.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunacite is located away from the sea, near the village of Yuncite Pazarjik district.
The bushin is a gold strip wrapped in a ring.
Yavor Bojadjiev, head of excavation at Tella Yuncite, dated the discovery in 4600 B.C.E. and declared that she was at least 200 years older than Varna’s gold.
The treasures of Varna, we recall, date to about the same period, from 4600 to 4,200 B.C.E.
There are currently no technologies to date the metal with perfect accuracy.
How can we be sure of what gold is more ancient?
Apparently, Professor Boyajiev knows more than he told Reuters, "I'm pretty sure the gold is older than Varna's."
It's an extremely important finding: it looks like a tiny object, but it's big enough to take the right place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Bojadjiev, scientists will soon analyse the composition of the metal and re-examine and more thoroughly the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bead as accurately as possible.
The location of the discovery explains a lot, too.
Tell Yuncite is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Tell Yuncite is now considered the oldest “city” of Europe.
Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium B.C.E.
Over the next centuries, metal processing in the region has developed dramatically, from the first metallurgical skills to the establishment of a full-fledged industry.
In the national history of this archaeological community, there is a special name: the Balkan-Carpathian Metallurgical Province.
In the 5th millennium B.C.E., urban settlements began to emerge around metal processing centres.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yuncite may be the oldest, since the artifacts of 4900 B.C.E. were found here.
I'd call Tell Yuncite a modern city prototype, though it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This place is 1,000 years older than Schumer," says Boyajiyev, referring to the generally accepted view that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia, a modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in the common sense of the word.
The excavation of Tell Yuncite has been under way since 1976.
During that time, archaeologists dug up almost 12 acres, about a third of the estimated total settlement area.
The remains of the fortress wall were found, once up to three meters high.
There is little left of houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish streets, public buildings, urban dense construction, business centre and outskirts.
Tell Yuncite is often called Bird City, where dozens of clay shapes of birds were found.
All birds were pictured in a state of rest, and it was assumed that they were not decorative objects but objects of local worship.
The Bird City was destroyed around 4100 B.C., possibly by Indo-European tribes coming from the northeast.
Nomads had no cities, but horses and guns.
The three-metre fortresses didn't stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of a brutal massacre: the remains of old men, women and children with traces of wounds caused by battle axes were found inside the houses.
New discoveries and new facts appear every year, changing the way we view the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the “lost” first civilization of Europe born in the Balkans.
The gold of Varna, found relatively recently in 1972, was a powerful incentive to seek this civilization.
Logically, Varna's gold luxury was supposed to precede something - some sort of tiny gold bead created in Tell Yuncite.
In Porsche, the 911 Targa model was artificially aged.
It is officially stated that the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is being trained manually by a unit that works with serial machines.
"Retro-Luc" is, for example, a special color of the Etna Blue bodywork, which was developed as early as 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, which even painted the logo of the model.
In addition, the Targa received a special white chart along the sides and special 20-inch RS Spider wheel drives, as well as some parts of the bodywork that were painted in white and gold metal.
In the interior of the retro-chunks, it is markedly smaller: it differs, in large measure, in the gray-blue gamma of the design, in new seats with extended electrical adjustment ranges, and in black anodated steel-separated thresholds with the unit logo.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a car cover and a rich, separate album with photographs of the production process.
The Porsche Exclusive power plant does not touch steel: the retro-targ is quite similar to the series.
It is equipped with a turbocharged six-cylinder engine of 3.0 litres, developing 420 litres and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in limited circulation, but neither the volume nor the cost of each particular sports car will be reported.
Facebook and advertising blockers have launched an arms race.
The recent introduction of Facebook technology to prevent advertising from being hidden on social media pages has provoked decision makers to block advertising in response.
The AdBlock Plus released the antidote, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon as well.
So AdBlock Plus advocated its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
Social media representatives pointed out that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of unlocked advertising, the decision from AdBlock Plus, along with commercial advertisements, blocked many regular posts from friends or pages.
On Facebook, they deplored this AdBlock Plus policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to a source among social media developers in TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on Facebook's desktop website will be ready within hours.
Thus, social networks and blockers opened up a sort of arms race, trying to beat each other, and the injured party became users who missed interesting notes from friends or saw ads where they weren't used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of the blocking of advertising have recently been highly controversial.
In Murmansk, the rapist will be brought to trial · Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been investigated by the Investigation Committee of the Russian Federation in the Murmansk region.
The charges against a 54-year-old man were very serious, involving sexual violence.
The investigation found that, at the end of November 2015, the accused in Pavlova Street in Murmansk had committed sexual acts with violence against a 20-year-old girl. The criminal case with the confirmed indictment was sent for consideration on the merits.
The sanction of this article provides for a maximum penalty of up to six years ' imprisonment.
Dongfeng will bring Fengguang 370 and Rich New's pickup at www.zr.ru to Russia.
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a popular car class in China that combines the merits of a minivan and a sneaker.
Another announced Russian premiere is Rich New.
Many Western firms of the Moscow International Automobile this year decided to ignore, so the emptiness of the Crocus Expo exhibition halls will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, a powerful front will be Dongfeng Motor, which has large sizes on the Russian market and is determined in the near future to offer our auto lovers some interesting news.
One of these will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossroads sold in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (a little less than 550,000 roubles at the current rate).
The Russians are unlikely to see such a price tag, and the issue of supplies to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 was able to reach 11th place on the list of top-selling minivans, although due to the large road clearance (175 mm) and the protective plastic sheathing on the lower perimeter of the body, it could well be classified as a sneaker.
Crosswen is built on the Fengguang 360 front-wheel platform, 370 has a similar wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is stronger and the equipment is richer.
The salon was decorated with wooden bars, but the large vertical sensor screen shown in the photo, "like Tesla's" at the central console, was only on the early exposition copies of the crossvane, and the cars with "music" were sold lighter.
Five of the seven landing sites are easily folded, forming a level loading area of 1,650 mm long, with a maximum boot volume of 1,500 litres.
The engine for Fengguang 370 is equipped with only one - 1.5 litre petrol "atmosphere" of 115 litres, connected to a 5-stage mechanical gearbox.
The manufacturer humbly ignores the dynamic qualities of the machine, but promises a budget-saving appetite of 6.7 litres/100 km.
The Rich New pickup is well known to the Russians as Nissan NP300 Navara before the last generation, but with a little bit of Chinese design style.
Despite the morally outdated design, this model still enjoys a stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and reluctant “worker horse”.
At a similar price, Rich New is likely to interest Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines for choice: petrol 2.4 litres (137 litres) or turbodiesel 2.5 litres (116 litres).
The gearbox is only a mechanic, the drive to the rear wheels, but there are modifications with a rigidly connected front.
It will be on the Dongfeng stand and the new flagman sedan A9, and its Russian premiere was announced by the Chinese firm as early as June.
Minveno-like crossovers on the Chinese market are growing, some of the latest ones are Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
At present, the Russian Dongfeng ruler consists of two models: S30 sedan and H30 Cross hatchback.
In the seven months of this year, Chinese dealers made 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax alerts will cease to be sent by mail to www.zr.ru
The tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for issuing notices of property taxes.
All Russian motorists have become accustomed to a pattern that has not changed over the years: in summer and autumn, they receive mail receipts for the previous year’s transport tax.
This year, however, many will not be able to wait.
The fact is that the tax inspection has changed the way citizens are notified.
For those who are registered in the Tax Payer's Personal Office on the official website of the institution nalog.ru, the notices will come in electronic form.
The inspection automatically considered such Russians to be online users and erased them from the standard, paper mail.
The news will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will still get their usual letters.
However, there is a way to get back to the old scheme, too, for the account holders on the site.
In order to do so, they will have to visit the tax office during the month of August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more comfortable.
The notice will appear in the "personal office" immediately after the writing, while the letter will take a few days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of Internet users of the tax inspection service has exceeded 18 million, which will enable the agency to save heavily on mailing.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly not enough to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some could register in a “personal office” for a one-time service and have forgotten it long ago.
These people will not wait to be notified by mail, and without knowing it, they will fall into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
The Tax Payer's Personal Office is accessed in three ways: through the Gosuslugi.ru portal account, by means of an electronic signature or by entering the login and password specified in the register card.
The latter may be obtained in person at any tax inspection office (whether or not the place of registration).
We recall that this year the transport tax must be paid before 1 December.
The distribution of notifications began in July.
The Mercedes-Benz G-class, which is designed to achieve very high returns, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse G-Power's masters, who moved on to modify the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing is foreign to its human masters.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63-571-strong flying sledgehammer with tank aerodynamics and up to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
By pumping the "muscles" of the crazy "helics," the masters took advantage of the 5.5-litre supercharged "8."
But the momentum of the 100 has improved by indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "kirpich" is capable of a 5.3 s leap.
However, the accelerations from the average speeds are certainly better for him.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if standard G 63 does not drive faster than 210 km/h, a tubed all-road with a deactivated electronic collar is capable of reaching 250 km/h.
Outside the vehicle is virtually indistinguishable from its factory source, except for other wheel drives, 23-inch Hurricane RR size 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach suite announced an amazing conceptual six-metre-long coupé, which will be presented as part of the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the Green Subbrand BMW i and will promote its electrical models under a separate brand.
A minimum of four green innovations are expected in the coming years.
