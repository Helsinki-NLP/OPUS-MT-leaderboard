Members of the Welsh Assembly don't want to look like muppets.
Among some members of the National Assembly, there is dissatisfaction with the proposal to adopt MWP abbreviations for their name (Member of the Welsh Parliament is a member of the Welsh Parliament).
The problematic solution is plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this acronym.
One of the Labourers, expressing his party's views, expressed concern that the new abbreviation was “recycled by Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers, not from Wales: on the Welsh twp means "bitch", and pwp means "cuckoo".
According to a member of the Welsh Party Assembly, his organization was generally “unsatisfied” and offered other options.
The conservative party “does not object” to the new abbreviation, but notes that MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in the Welsh language is spoken roughly as the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting the change of name bill, made the following statement: “The final decision on the name of the members of the Assembly will of course remain with them”.
The Welsh Governance Act 2017 empowers the National Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Committee published a public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which the Welsh Parliament instead of the Assembly had found widespread support among the local population.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the Welsh Parliament Members option, while the MWP option received the greatest public support.
Members seemed to offer other options, but it would be difficult for the Presiding Member, Elin Jones, to find a solution that would be acceptable to all, and to recall that the draft law on changes should be submitted within a few weeks.
The reform laws will include other modifications to the Assembly ' s work process, including new rules on disqualification of members of the Assembly and the organization of the Committee system.
Members of the Assembly will vote in favour of the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians will vote to rename the country as the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
A popular vote is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims against the Greek province, and has repeatedly objected to the accession of its northern neighbour to the EU and NATO.
President George Ivanov of Macedonia, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, stated that he did not intend to recognize the results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, note that changing the name of the country is just the price of joining the EU and NATO.
Crisis in Harlem parishes: St. Martin’s bells are forever silent
“The neighborhoods I was talking to said that there was a bar and a church at each corner,” Adams says.
“And now there is nothing left.”
The disappearance of bars can still be understood:
“The format of communication has changed.”
“The bar has ceased to be a kind of living room for the entire area, which has been visited regularly.”
But as far as churches are concerned, the money received from the sale of assets will be short enough, no matter how much their leaders hope. “They will be left with nothing sooner or later.”
At the church site, he added, there would be a multi-family home whose occupants were unlikely to support those who remained in the parish.
“The majority of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” Adams says. “This will bring the day when such churches will close, because new neighbors will never become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black district: Metropolitan Comunity in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church 10 years later.
The first members of the Methodist Church left the parish in the 1930s.
Their building was bought by a black parish next door.
When St. Martin's church came into the hands of the black community, it was led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of shops on 125th Street, Harlem's main trading artery, where they refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, the fire caused extensive damage to the building, and Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the installation of a carillon during the reconstruction work.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, who succeeded him at the head of St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the Carillon “a colloquium for the poor. ”
But the expert who tested the carillon in July called it a different term: “cultural heritage” and “unique historical instrument”.
An expert from the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng, also noted that it was the Carillon of St. Martin's Church that was the world's first instrument of its kind played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lindh. 18 years ago, he was invited to play a larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's Church has not yet found a substitute for him.
Over the past few months, there has been a difficult situation around St. Martin’s Church with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by secular church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, which includes secular leaders, approached the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would “try to transfer the cost of the works” to the parochial assembly, although the latter had no bearing on the choice of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a shark injured a 13-year-old lobster diver.
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a 13-year-old diver in California was attacked by a shark and injured.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hummel told in an interview with the KSWB-TV station (San Diego), he dived with his friends on Saturday morning and heard the boy scream for help about half an hour later, and he and his friends sailed on a boat to the scene of the attack and pulled the teenager out of the water.
According to Hummel, at first he decided that the boy was very happy to catch a lobster, but quickly “recognized that he was yelling, ‘I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
Hummel, a swimmer, observed that “his skin was completely ripped off around the clavicle.”
“I shouted to get everyone out of the water, ‘Here's a shark!’” Hummel says.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Radi Children ' s Hospital in San Diego; his condition is assessed as critical.
The species of shark attacking a teenager is unknown.
Squad Captain Larry Giles reported during a press briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks ago but had not been classified as a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack suffered injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed the area from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Giles observed that there are 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Seinbury's planning to take over the British perfume and cosmetic market.
Seinsbury is going to install makeup and perfume sections at Booths, Superdrag and Debenhams stores with cosmetics consultants, using the suite store model.
Britain’s perfume and cosmetic market is estimated at Pound2.8 billion and continues to expand, while in fashion and household goods, sales are falling; in order to capture a large portion of this desirable market as an experiment in 11 stores throughout the country, large sections of cosmetics and perfumeria will be presented and, if successful next year, many other stores will have to be expected.
Supermarket owners are looking for something to fill the shelf that used to be used for television, microwave stoves, household goods, and investments in the perfume and cosmetic market seem to be a good solution.
According to the representatives of Seinsbury, it is planned to double the range of cosmetic products to 3,000 names, including for the first time stamps such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, by the type of organization of goods in Booth's stores.
In addition, the brand line of the “Bootic Cosmetics” products will be reorganized to accommodate the demands of young buyers.
The two Seynsbury stores will present the French Shop perfume kiosks, the first of which has already opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and the second is expected to open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Internet commerce and the tendency to buy a small amount of food every day in small shops close to home have forced supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, President Seinsbury, says that the outlets will gradually become department stores, and his supermarket network is fighting for buyers to compete against cheap shops like Aldy and Leedle, offering more services and non-food items.
Hundreds of Seinsbury supermarkets host Argos' outlets, and some of them have now found Habitat's stores since the network acquired both stamps two years ago, resulting in increased sales of food products and revenues from these acquisitions.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to give new life to its cosmetics and medicine departments have not been successful.
A joint venture between Seinsbury and Booths was organized in the early 2000s, but there were further disagreements among participants regarding the sharing of proceeds from the sale of pharmacy products in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the Seinsbury pharmaceutical business (a total of 281 stores) to Celecio, the owner of the Lloyds Farmasi network, for £125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a wide line of leather suites to La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of Seinsbury, says, "We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more favourable environment for our customers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be available to help the council.
Our variety of stamps for any taste, pleasant design and convenience of shops will attract many visitors to search for cosmetics and perfume, which will be a completely new concept of shopping.”
Peter Jones reacted "abhorrently" to Holly Willoughby's exit from the £11 million deal.
Peter Jones's star of the Dragon's Logging Show is "infuriated" by Holly Willoughby's TV host from a £11 million deal she intended to make with Peter's Lifestyle Brand, but instead preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their joint brand of housewear and Truly accessories.
The couple's business was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of this morning announced her decision in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's decision to leave their lucrative Lifestyle Brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV has provoked the rage of Peter Jones, the star of the Dragon's Logo.
According to our sources, Jones was “infuriated” when the favorite of television viewers at a busy meeting held on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that after new contracts of up to 1.5 million, she would not have enough time to share their home clothes and Truly accessories.
Their brand was compared to the child of actress Gwyneth Paltrow with a Goop brand, and it was expected that her sales would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
A 37-year-old host announced her departure from Instagram, while Jones himself left Britain on a private plane in the direction of one of her villas.
According to one source, "Truly Mark was Holly's top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her a carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Her decision has made all the parties to the deal in a state of shock.
Everyone was stunned by what happened on Tuesday, as the stamps had remained for weeks before the launch.
A warehouse filled with goods ready for sale remained at Marlowe headquarters.”
Experts believe that the departure of the lead star, this morning, one of Britain’s most popular stars, could cost the firm millions of pounds because of significant investments in goods, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as the potential delay in launching the line.
In addition, it is a long-standing break-up of friendships.
The three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby created a brand of Truly with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, led the company in March.
Both couples often spend their vacations together, and Jones also owns 40% of the company's shares on Dan Baldwin's television production.
Willoughby will be the M&S ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as host of ITV's "I'm a Celebrity".
A source from Jones' close environment said last night, "We can't comment on his business."
Complex negotiations, "and then we fell in love with each other"
He joked about the criticism that the media would bring against him because of the “unworthy president” comment and the positive appreciation of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many claims?
Says Trump, imitating the voice of the news host.
“I did not give up anything.”
He noted that Kim Jong-un was interested in a re-meeting after Trump called them the first summit held in Singapore in June a significant step towards reducing nuclear weapons stockpiles in North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have reached a dead end.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean high-ranking diplomat Lee Young Ho addressed world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly meeting on Saturday, saying that North Korea was still waiting for a “appropriate response” from the US after the DPRK’s initial disarmament measures.
Instead, the US, noted the diplomat, continues to use sanctions as leverage.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment.
“North Korea is a wonderful place,” he said.
“We were on the verge of a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
And now we have an excellent relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong Eun had borne fruit: the missile tests had been put to an end, hostages had been released and the United States troops remaining in the territory of the DPRK had also returned to their homeland.
Speaking of his relationship with Kim Jong Eun, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was not strange.
“It's easy for the president to say something that suits you, but then, instead of 10,000 people on the street who are rushing into this full-blown hall, there would be only 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered in front of him.
The tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia: catastrophic destruction, hundreds of casualties
In the early days of the earthquake that struck Lombok, foreign NGOs said that there was no need for their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lomboca population had lost a roof over its head, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national disaster, which was a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that there is no need for international support, so it has been difficult,” says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children is preparing a team to go to Pala, but we do not yet know if a foreign group can work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopo, an official representative of the National Disaster Management Authority, the Indonesian leadership is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palau in order to determine whether international organizations should be involved.
Given the persistent seismic instability in Indonesia, the country remains horrendously ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coastlines.
Despite the tsunami warning, a alarm was not included in Palau to alert the population, which is likely to have resulted in so many casualties.
Transport between many Indonesian islands is problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A floating hospital formerly attached to Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is headed to Pala, but the road to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the strengthening of Indonesia's old infrastructure the main focus of his campaign and has spent enormous resources on improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, who is running for a new term next year, has become overwhelmed by funding problems.
The President is also criticized for increasing sectarian enmity between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
Over a thousand people were killed and tens of thousands more lost their homes as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, bows with arrows and other self-shooting.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Starridge compares the score against Chelsea naked to the far upper corner of the gate
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from defeating the 89th minute of the Premier League against Chelsea, held on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge got a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27 metres from the Chelsea gate when his team was losing with a score of 1-0.
He moved to the left and ran through the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and ended up in the long top corner of the grid.
Golquiper Kep Arrisabalaga jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was too late.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com, Starridge said, "It was all about getting in that position and getting a ball, players like Shak, always playing the best of the game, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible."
"I saw Kante coming to me, got the ball, and I hit the gate for a little while."
In the first half of the match, the Chelsea team played with a score of 1-0, scored by the Belgian man Eden Azar for the 25th minute.
The central Chelsey attacker, turning back Mateo Kovacić, broke halfway through the middle of the field into half the Liverpool.
In the middle of the field, Kovacic played one touch.
Then he passed the pass to Azar, who went out on the gate.
Azar overcame the defense and struck the gatekeeper Alison Becker from the left flank, striking the far corner of the net.
Liverpool will meet the Napoli team at the group stage of the League of Champions, and the match will take place at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea will play with Videoton at the UEFA Euroliga game, which will take place on Thursday in London, also at 3 p.m.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and the tsunami that followed in Indonesia reached 832 and reported to the National Disaster Management Authority on Sunday morning.
Under the ruins of buildings destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 points on the Richter scale, many people are reported to have been left behind: the earthquake occurred on Friday and caused a tsunami of up to 6 metres high, reported Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official representative of the Office during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000 people, was overwhelmed by the rubble of houses that collapsed.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of injuring a woman in death.
The body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead County, Mercyside, and a murder investigation is under way.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 at Grayson Mews Complex on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are looking for possible witnesses to the murder among the locals.
Detective Inspector O'Hagen says, "The investigation is at an early stage, but I strongly ask everyone who was in the John Street area in Birkenhead and could observe or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
I also address everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who might have captured something on the video recorder, and ask for any information that might help the investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the victim had resided in Birkenhead and her body had been found in the compound.
This afternoon, alleged acquaintances arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is under way, and police officers are preparing to report the tragedy of the victim's immediate relatives.
A taxi driver living in the Grayson Mews complex tried to enter his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he learned of what had happened, he lost his ability to speak.
The residents of the house were told that they would not be able to get home for at least a few hours.
One police officer told the occupant that the entire surrounding area was considered a crime scene.
One woman cried.
“What a horror!” she repeated.
At 2 p.m., two police buses arrived at the scene and another remained outside the fence.
Several policemen were placed inside the fence to monitor the apartment complex.
Anyone who has any information is requested to send a personal message to @MerPolCC's Twitter subscriber, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 (case 247 of 30 September).
Cromwell's monument in front of the House of Parliament sparked a violent debate about the “census of history”
Cromwell’s “eviction” would be a well-deserved retribution for the barbaric destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts of England by his followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, Cromwell’s Memory Society called Mr. Crick’s proposal “a madness” and “an attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Memorial Society, stated: “As part of the ongoing debate on the demolition of historic monuments, the question of Oliver Cromwell’s statue in front of the Westminster Palace inevitably arose.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the iconic movement during the English civil wars.
Oliver Cromwell is probably suffering for the sins of his ancestors, Thomas, who lived forever before.
Sir William Hamo Tornicroft's magnificent statue of Cromwell's authorship reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historic achievements of a man who many still regard as worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith stated: “Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell to be a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case to be a monarchy.
Whether this view is historically accurate remains the subject of professional debate.
But it can be said with certainty that the conflict that erupted in the middle of the 17th century affected the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this section.
Its achievements as Lord Protector are also to be commended and respected.”
A Chinese farmer was stabbed to death by a killer pig.
In a market in south-west China, a farmer became a victim of a pig, reporting to local media.
The victim's bloody body (only his name, Yuan, is mentioned in the media) was found with a broken artery near a slob at the market in the Lupánshui district of Guizhou province in southern China, reported by the Morning Post newspaper on Sunday.
Pig is preparing to inoculate pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005, Sinin district of Qinghai Province of China.
Yuan and his cousin arrived from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, his cousin discovered Yuan’s dead body, and the door to the nearby pigyard was open.
There was a huge scumbag in the pig shop with blood on it.
The forensic examination found that a 250-kg pig ate the farmer to death.
“My brother's legs were bleeding and maimed,” said Guiyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the victim.
The surveillance video showed that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the newspaper Evening News that the pig had been isolated in a separate box during the investigation in order to avoid further attacks.
It is reported that the Yuan family is negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the death of the farmer.
Swine attacks on people are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously traumatizing a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound animal nailed a Welsh farmer to a tractor and let him go only when he was afraid of his wife.
In 2012, a farmer from Oregon in the United States was eaten by his own pigs, and a Canadian farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can affect their hidden aggression as a trigger mechanism.
"Pigs of the game,
They're biting and very curious, but they don't want to hurt you.
You should simply inculcate in your animals a sense of measure and respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring the rains to a large part of the southwest of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to lose power by moving through a cooler zone to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, over the next few days, it will bring rainfall and flooding to northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. in New York, the cyclone reached the 1st category with winds up to 135 km/h, 360 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, heading east to the west coast of the United States, and approaching the coast of the state of Lower California, the storm will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico, to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, more than 25 cm of rainfall is expected in Mexico.
Tropical humidity in the emerging low-pressure zone is expected to cause heavy rains in the coming days in the south-west.
The rains from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous flooding, dirt flows and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, due to high tropical air humidity, rainfall rates can reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In some parts of the southwest US, mostly in most of Arizona, it is expected that the rainfall will be between 5 and 10 cm.
The risk of sudden rapid flooding due to uneven distribution of tropical rains is not excluded.
With the current risk of tropical rain, walking in the desert has serious consequences.
Livneys can turn canyons into turbulent rivers, and thunder can cause violent winds and clouds of dust to rise.
With the emergence of a low-pressure zone, rains will collapse on the southern coast of California.
It is possible to fall up to 1.5 cm of precipitation, which could cause small mudflows and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
This is the first rainfall since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, tropical rains will take place in Arizona and will spread to other territories by Monday night and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the rains will take place in four corners and last until Wednesday evening.
In October, extreme temperature changes will occur throughout the United States due to the low Arctic air temperature at sufficiently high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes this combination leads to severe temperature variations in a small area.
Such sharp temperature changes will be particularly visible in the central United States on Sunday.
Between the temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa, there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will accumulate and spread to other territories.
In most of the US central and eastern territories, warm weather is expected in early October, and temperatures will be as high as 27 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
In New York City on Tuesday, the temperature can rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast is likely to have an unusually high temperature on the east coast of the United States until mid-October.
The Senate hearing in the case of Judge Brett Cavanaugh saw more than 20 million viewers
The testimony of Brett Cavanaugh and Christina Blazi Ford, who accused Cavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, on Thursday attracted over 20 million viewers to six television channels.
The political confrontation over Cavanaugh's candidacy was unexpectedly continued, and on Friday, an urgent news report was sent by Republican Jeff Flake to make it a condition that the charges against a lawyer be investigated by the FBI within one week.
According to Ford at the hearings before the Senate's Legal Committee, she is “100%” confident that Cavanaugh was intoxicated and tried to strip her at a school party.
Cavanaugh testified emotionally, saying that he was 100% sure that it didn't happen.
According to the Nielsen research agency, more than 20.4 million viewers watched the debate on Friday.
The Agency took into account the average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Data on the number of audiences of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen’s ratings do not always take into account viewers watching TV at work.
In comparison, this is an average audience following the American football game in playoffs or the Oscar ceremony.
The largest audience was Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Cavanaugh's appointment: the Senate hearing, which lasted all day, saw an average of 5.69 million viewers, reported by Nielsen.
The second is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audition was 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC watched 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, according to Nielsen.
The interest in the case has not diminished since the hearing.
There was a real drama with Jeff Flake on Friday.
After a senator from Arizona, considered moderate Republican, announced his intention to support Cavanaugh’s candidacy, CNN and CBS television channels were able to capture the camera, as on Friday morning, on his way to a meeting of the Legal Committee, Flake encountered a group of activists in the elevator who criticized the senator.
The whole world has seen him get his eyes down from angry women live on CNN.
“I stand before you,” one of them said.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
“You have power, while so many women are powerless,” they tried to explain their position.
Flack replied to the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and that he would speak about it at the committee meeting, and the elevator doors had closed, hiding the senator from all-embracing cameras.
When a few hours later the Legal Committee was preparing to confirm Cavanaugh's candidacy for the post of judge and send her to the Senate for a general vote, all television channels broadcast the meeting live.
However, Flake made one condition: an investigation by the FBI into these charges against a candidate by next week, as a democratic minority sought.
Blake claims to have changed his mind because of the intervention of a friend, a senator from the Democrats, Chris Coons.
He made the final decision by talking to Kuns and several other senators.
Flake’s decision had had an effect, as it was evident that the Republicans lacked the votes to confirm Cavanaugh without an investigation.
By decree of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses his critics of "political games" about the Brexit situation.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused politicians criticizing her plan to leave the European Union of putting narrow party interests ahead of society.
The British Prime Minister arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published on one page of May’s interview, former head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Braxit Shock Plan, saying that he considered the introduction of customs duties between Britain and the EU “absolutely ridiculous”.
Wade Simms' death in a gunfight: the police arrested Davon Simpson on suspicion of murdering a forwarder at the University of Louisiana.
The police arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of a shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player playing for the University of Louisiana.
According to Baton Rouge police, 20-year-old Daion Simpson was arrested and detained on second-degree murder charges.
The police released a video of a fight involving Simms and Simpson, where Simms lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, a regional CBS channel, the police found Simpson's DNA on the glasses found at the crime scene.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he had fatally injured Wade.
According to Advocate, Simpson's bail is set at $350,000.
The Coroner of the Eastern District of Baton Rouge released a pre-trial detention on Friday: death was caused by a cross-cutting gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Division is grateful to the Criminal Investigation Division of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Forensics Laboratory, the University of the South Police and the local residents, who assisted in the investigative activities leading to the detention.
Joe Alleveva, Director of Sports, University of Louisiana, thanked the law enforcement forces for their “good faith in catching a criminal.”
Simms was only 20 years old.
A two-metre forward was born in Baton Rouge; his father, Wayne, was also a member of the Louisiana State University team.
In the last season, Simms scored 5.6 points and averaged 2.6 rebounds per match.
Team coach Will Wade made a statement on Friday morning, saying that the tragic death of Wade Simms had caused "shock" and "true grief" for all players.
"That's what I've always been afraid of," he added.
The vulcan covered Mexico City's ashes.
The Volcán Popocatepetl fell asleep with ashes in the southern vicinity of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre of Mexico recommended that the population should not approach the volcano: its crater recorded activity and produced 183 steam and gas emissions within 24 hours.
The Centre observed that there were frequent noises and trembles near the volcano.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochimilko, social media users published photographs of frontal glass of cars covered with thin ashes.
After an earthquake of 7.1 Mw, which struck central Mexico in September 2017, geophysics observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 kilometres southeast of the capital.
The Volcan Popocatepetl (or, for its own, Don Goyo) has been an active volcano since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, a multi-thousand rally was held in Barcelona to mark the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which divided the country into two camps, and there were clashes between the supporters of autonomy and the police, and six participants were detained.
Police officers pushed the protesters out of independence, while the latter, wearing black masks, threw eggs and powdered paint at the security guards, raising clouds of dark dust in the very center of Barcelona.
The riots resumed with renewed force after the police launched the crowd control baton.
For a few hours, the supporters of independence chanted: “Let's not forget, let's not forgive!” and their opponents answered them with the slogan, “Long live Spain!”.
According to local press reports, fourteen participants were slightly injured in the hospital.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which was declared illegal by the Spanish Government, but was an important milestone for the separatists, and a year later, tension persists in a region seeking sovereignty.
Catalonia voted with a huge margin to withdraw from Spain, but the appearance was low because the opponents of the withdrawal largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to block the referendum at the country ' s polling stations in violent clashes.
On Friday, the separatists spent the night on the stated route of a demonstration in support of the Spanish police in order to prevent it from taking place.
The demonstration took place anyway, but it took another route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who attended a secessionist rally in his wife's company, complains that the hope of Catalonia's acquisition of sovereignty is becoming increasingly elusive.
“There was one of the most important events in our lives last year.
My parents weeped with joy when they were given the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a hanged state,” he says.
In the recent December elections for local government, the Qatari parties that are in favour of secession from Spain won an important victory, albeit with a slight break, but this year their movement is losing its supporters, as many of the prominent leaders of the movement are either on the run or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Pouch, a 42-year-old mechanic recording a police rally on the phone, said that the conflict was heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
He added: “The tension is increasing.”
On Saturday, Oriol Junkeras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in regular elections to the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government”, he says.
Londonderry: The car crashed into the house, all three accomplices arrested.
One of the houses in Londonberry was several times damaged by a car; the men in it, aged 33, 34 and 39, were taken into custody.
The attack took place on Thursday around 7.30 p.m. local time in the area of Ballingard Cressent.
This resulted in damage to the gate and the building itself, reported by Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings.
There are reports that an onion shot may have been fired into the car.
Livingstone victory over Rangers thanks to Menga's sharp goal
The first goal of Dolly Mengi was a guaranteed victory for the Livingstone team.
"Livingstone won an unexpected victory over Rangers "for the head coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerrard, this is only the second defeat in 18 games.
The exact strike by Dolly Mengi equalized Gary Holt's team to the Hibernian Club in the score table, where they share second place.
The Gerrard Club did not win this season of the Premier League; on Sunday, they will meet with the leaders of the Harts group, whose Rangers are eight points behind.
On Thursday, the Rangers will be playing a League of Europe match with the Austrian Rapid Club (Vienna).
The Livingstone Club continues its winning series in the division, having played six games and not been defeated since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the team's chief coach.
Lost moments for Livingstone in a fight with pushy guests
Trainer Holt's caretakers were supposed to keep an account from the beginning, because the Rangers clearly failed to handle their pressure.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the defense line, but the goal didn't work out of his weak attempt, and then Alan Litgow's defender, swinging too far, couldn't stop the Kate Hullett ball from getting into the net.
The host allowed Rangers to play in front of their defense line, counting on dangerous moments when the game resumed.
That's how they missed that big goal.
The Rangers gave way to the free shot, and Livingstone took the opportunity to deliver Declan Gallagher and Robinson to Menge, who scored out of central position.
By then, Rangers had the upper hand in possession of the ball, but the protection of the host team was invincible, so the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned.
The second time continued in the same pattern, although Kelly still had to strike Alfredo Morelos.
Allan McGregor kicked the ball off Scott Pittman, and Litgow made a large pitch from the standard position.
Balls were constantly caught in Livingstone's fine, but all attacks were reflected, and the two demands of the penalty, one for provoking Glenn Middleton's spare player and the other for the game, were not met.
"Fenomenal" game "Livingstone" -- analysis
From BBC Scotland – Alasder Lamont, from Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
It's a fenomeenal game and a great score for the Livingstone team.
All the players were great, and they overcame all expectations again, continuing their climb to football Olympics.
Their style of play and composition hasn't changed much since they got up to the top of the rating line, and Coach Holt's great credit is that he mobilized this team from the start.
There were a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Halkett led a great organized defense, and Menga wouldn't let Connor Goldson and Joe Warall relax.
At the same time, the Rangers were unable to keep up with the rhythm.
Although they had a good game moment with Coach Gerrard, this time they didn't live up to our expectations.
In the last few minutes of the match, they lacked control of the ball, and only once were they able to defend the host team. The Rangers, which went down the middle of the table, had a lot to think about.
Erdogan's cool reception during his visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast, there was a beautiful weather, and both of the top were in a great mood.
This was the last day of President Erdoğan's visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO member countries, a visit already involving some conflicts.
The heads of country have not been able to understand such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey ' s accession to the EU.
After Erdoğan went to Cologne to attend the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey lives in Cologne.
For security reasons, the police prevented a 2,500-dollar crowd from entering the mosque, but many of Erdoğan ' s supporters settled nearby to see their President.
In the same place, opponents of Erdoğan’s regime, including the Kurds, gathered to condemn both Erdoğan’s policy and the German Government’s decision to invite him to Germany.
The existence of radically opposing views at the meeting reflects the ambiguous nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots exalt Erdoğan, while others view him as a tyrant.
Deptford road crash: collision with a car led to the death of a cyclist
In London, the car encountered a cyclist who died at the scene.
The accident occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a lively junction in the southeast of Depfort, around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car and the paramedics who arrived at the site tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without being conscious.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just a mile and a half from the scene, on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a vehicle whose driver escaped.
The London Police report that efforts are under way to identify the deceased and to notify his immediate relatives.
In the meantime, the road is blocked at the scene and the bus route has been changed: motorists are asked not to enter the area.
Long-Lartin prison riots: six policemen injured
According to the Long-Lartin administration, six police officers were injured during riots in a male high security prison.
The men's high security prison Long-Lartin ( Woostershire) has been experiencing riots since Sunday around 9:30 local time.
The Tornado Task Force was called to deal with the riots involving eight prisoners from one wing.
The police officers suffered minor injuries to the soft tissue of the person and received medical treatment on the ground.
According to the official representative of the prison, “specially trained officers were recruited to resolve the incident at the Long-Lartin Correctional Centre.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically condemn the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their preventive measures may be changed for a longer period.”
Long-Lartin currently holds over 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had been hospitalized and attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the prison authorities were forced to engage special units to calm the raging prisoners who threw biljart balls at the wardens.
Hurricane Rose could flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which would benefit drylands)
Arizona rarely enters the intensive tropical cyclone, but this time it has been “suffering”: early next week, Hurricane Rosa, making a final leap, must pass over the desert area of South West and bring with it the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and in southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to take a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday and rain on Monday night.
The Bureau of the National Meteorological Service in Phoenix reported on Twitter that “only a dozen tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression within a radius of 320 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 65 kilometres from the Arizona border.”
According to the latest forecasts by the National Meteorological Service, between 5 and 10 centimetres of rainfall will fall, reaching 15 centimetres on the Arizona plateau of Mogolon Rome.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, possibly falling up to 2.5 to 5 centimetres of rainfall, the rainfall can be as high as 10 cm.
The rain caused by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing for areas that are overwhelmed by the rains, as the region has long suffered from drought.
While flooding may be dangerous, heavy rains can ease the dry season that does not take place in the Southwest of the United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, there is at least a severe drought on more than 40 per cent of Arizona's territory (the second largest category),” reports web.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will attack the Mexican state of Lower California.
As of Sunday morning, a hurricane with a maximum speed of 137 km/h is 360 km south of the town of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane found itself in a colder zone on the Pacific coast, thus losing its power.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico as a tropical storm.
It is expected that there will be abundant flooding in some parts of Mexico.
"From Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, it can fall up to 7 to 10 cm in rainfall, places up to 25 cm," reports the web site Weather.com.
Then Hurricane Rosa will head north through Mexico, and on Tuesday morning it will reach the border with Arizona in the tropical cyclone category, from Arizona to south Utah by Tuesday night.
“The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rose and its residues is the heavy rains in Lower California, in the north-west of Sonora and in the desert areas of the south-west United States,” reports the National Meteorological Service.
It is expected that the precipitation will result in dangerous flooding, dirt flows in the desert and possible landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Northon: four suspects arrested for attempted murder
In Somerset, a 16-year-old boy was seriously stabbed and three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The victim was found in the Excelsior Terras area of Midsomer Norton, about 4 a.m. Saturday morning.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as “stable”.
On the same night, four suspects were arrested in Radstock district, aged 17, 18 and 20, reporting to Avon and Somerset County Police.
The police are looking for possible crime witnesses with any video of the incident on their mobile phone.
Donald Trump: "On Cavanaugh, "all hatred, all hatred" of the Democrats broke down."
“The voice for Judge Cavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by the Democrats,” Trump said at a meeting of his fellow members in Wiling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, during the process of asserting Kavano's nomination for a candidate, “all hatred, all anger” of the Democratic Party was broken.
On Thursday, Cavanaugh testified at the U.S. Congress, categorically rejecting the accusation of Christina Blazi Ford that he had sexually harassed her more than 30 years ago when both were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during her trial.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that that day “the American people saw Cavanaugh’s brilliant mind, class, and courage.”
“The voice for Judge Cavanaugh's assertion is a voice for one of the most distinguished lawyers of our time, with a stainless state record,” the President announced to the crowd of his fellow members in West Virginia.
In his speech, the President indirectly raised the issue of Cavanaugh's nomination, referring to the importance of the Republican turnout for the Congress and House of Representatives elections.
“Four weeks remain until the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not part of them, but I'm part of the race in another way," he said.
“I wear like burnt and fight for our excellent candidates.”
Trump believes that the Democrats have set themselves the task “with all their power to resist us”.
According to the regulations, the first key vote in the Senate to approve Cavanaugh ' s candidacy should take place no later than Friday, was announced by the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party.
The earthquake in Indonesia has claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of casualties continues to rise
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had died, and many had been taken away by giant waves that had seized the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which had been hit by an incredible tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims were hundreds of visitors to the beach festival in the city of Palu, and on Friday, at the sunset of the coast, waves of almost six meters [6 m] were caught, which swept away and caused the sudden death of many of the people present.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When a storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach vacation instead of fleeing to shelter immediately and lost their lives,” reported Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official of the Indonesian National Disaster Management Authority during a press conference held in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come one way, the water stream had cars, logs, whole houses, and the element destroyed everything in its way,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and hit the coast with all its force.
Some of them climbed the trees, saving their lives.
Some 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palau.
The aerial photograph of the Disaster Management Authority shows destroyed houses, shops, broken bridges and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by subterranean tremors.
A series of earthquakes took place in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The statement of the Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) states that the earthquake-induced energy release was about 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have been stronger than expected because of the geographical location of the city at the end of the long narrow Gulf.
Nugroho called the damage “scale”, adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of the dead were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings; 540 people were injured and 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho added that casualties and destruction could be even more significant along the coast to 300 km from Pala, a location near the epicentre of the earthquake in Dungal.
Communications from Dungal were “totally destroyed and no information was received”.
“Dungala region is home to more than 300,000 people”, reports the International Committee of the Red Cross in its communiqué, whose staff and volunteers have already travelled to the disaster zone.
“A tragedy has occurred, but this is not the limit,” the report states.
On Saturday, the Authority was severely criticized because it did not report the arrival of the tsunami in Palau in time, but the authorities believe that the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
There's an amateur video on social media where a man on the top floor of the building screams at an impending tsunami, desperately trying to get people's attention on the street.
A few minutes later, the wall of water falls on the shore, carrying whole houses and cars.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this video.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a major electrolysis drain, resulting in the loss of communications in Pala, which made rescue operations very difficult.
Humanitarian military transport aircraft were dispatched from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated population still lacks food and basic necessities, and government sources report.
The airport was opened only for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed for other flights until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Pala on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's a very bad situation.
The volunteers of the World Vision charity arrived safely from Dungal to Pala, where employees found shelter in tents of tarpaulins that had been smashed in the yard of their office building, saying Doséba Sinai that their eyes had seen a horrendous picture of total destruction on the way.
“They've seen a lot of destroyed houses,” he says.
It's a very bad situation.
Charitable organizations have begun to put in place humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many have complained that international NCBs have failed to reach Pala.
Indonesian law only allows for the involvement of funding, humanitarian assistance and staff of foreign organizations after declaring the site of the disaster to be a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is considered to be a local disaster,” reports Auliya Ariani, Spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares a natural disaster to be national, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but so far the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that struck Pala, friends and relatives of the missing still hope for their miraculous salvation, which will restore the people’s faith in the best.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued who fell into the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers extracted a woman from the wreckage of the building, who spent two days there, near her mother's dead body.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia's national paraplanetry coach, trained two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian games in Indonesia.
Among the other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
“I am not the last person in this sport, and it is emotionally difficult to survive,” he said.
He recalls that when he learned of the collapse of Roa Roa's hotel from other paraplaners, he was desperately trying to reach out to his colleagues in Palau on the beach festival in the next hours.
However, his messages were displayed with one gray tick, not two blue ones.
“It means that no messages have been delivered”, he considers.
Robbery of $26,750 while maintaining an ATM in Newport on Levi
On Friday morning, the intruders stole $26,750 from Brink's ATM Incassant, who runs an ATM in Newport on Levi, says in a press release by the Newport Police.
According to investigator Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armoured minibus took cash from an ATM located in the entertainment complex and was about to fill it with new notes.
At that time, "Brink's employee ran off the back of the intruder" and stole a bag of banknotes to refuel the ATM.
Witnesses reported that several suspects had fled the crime scene, but the police did not indicate the number of potential participants.
Citizens who have any information about these persons are requested to contact the Newport Police Unit at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West came up with a new name: Ye.
He announced this on Saturday on Twitter: “The person formerly known as Kanye West.”
41-year-old West has been wearing this alias for a long time and even put it on the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The news came in advance of Kanye's appearance in the Saturday Night Live, where he plans to present his new album, Yandhi.
Kanye West will act as co-leader instead of singer Ariana, who has cancelled her participation because of “emotional feelings”, reports the author of the show.
West has previously stated that the pseudonym is not only a shortened version of his name, but also has a religious meaning.
“Ye, the most common word in the Bible, it means you, you,” West explained the title of his album in a recent interview with Big Boy.
"I mean, I'm you, I'm us.
At first it was Kanye, which means "the only one," and now I'm just Ye, a reflection of all the good, bad, incomprehensible in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to understand who we are.
Kanye is not the first known rapper to decide to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Deady, P. Diddy or just Diddy, asked this year to call himself Love ("love") or Braza Love ("Bruder Love" or "Bruder Love").
A rapper named JZ, who spoke with West, also changed his name several times: with a defiance and no, capital letters or lower letters.
The President of Mexico solemnly pledges not to use military force against the civilian population
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico vowed never to resort to military force against the civilian population in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration, which culminated in a bloody confrontation.
Speaking on Saturday at Tlatelloco Square, President López Obrador promised to “never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On 2 October 1968, during a peaceful demonstration of students, the first shots were fired at the crowd and a massacre began that claimed the lives of 300 people, amidst increasing left-wing student movements in Latin America.
López Obrador also pledged support to Mexican youth in the form of a monthly study scholarship and the opening of more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of learning opportunities led young people directly into the criminal world.
US$ needs to double funding for IDI development
China and its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence should not be underestimated — the US should double its investment in its scientific development, as Lee Kaifu, an II investor and entrepreneur with experience at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Previously, several U.S. ministries made statements on the II, although the U.S. generally does not have a clear strategy for the development of II.
At the same time, China presented its own plan as early as last year: its goal is to be the first to innovate in the AI by 2030.
“A doubling of the IE research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking forward to the next breakthrough in II,” says Lee.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big achievement of the AI would be made in the US, said Lee CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most prominent II companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the highest player in the American Othello, and then he was head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous US government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge agency Defense Advance Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would be to help find people with non-traditional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
“It is not China that absorbs academic leaders, but corporations,” Li is convinced.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been hiring a glove from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the US develop artificial intelligence.
“I think that Green Cards should automatically be offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence”, he says.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council of State published a plan for the development of artificial intelligence for the next generation.
The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to scientists in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Lee claims.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, in which partners from industry and academia should participate, and the White House announced the establishment of an Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in IE research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which sought to establish the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence, has not taken any action in this direction for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change their country's name to “Republic of Northern Macedonia”, which would resolve a multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name is a claim on its territory and vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments concluded an agreement based on a new name proposal, but national opponents argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the voter turnout would be at a minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was as follows: “Do you support NATO and EU membership, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
Proponents of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the dissolution of Yugoslavia, should pay that price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Olivera Georgievskaya, a resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of members of Parliament stated that they would abide by the outcome of the vote in order to make it decisive, although it was not legally binding.
A change of name will require a two-thirds majority of members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Yose Tanevski, a voter from the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will open the way for its joining NATO and the European Union in Strumic, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene, breaking chairs in front of tents established by those citizens who were going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and EU membership, but we want to unite with a tall head, not by putting the thresholds of the cabinets,” Kawadarkov says.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zayev said that NATO membership would bring about investments in Macedonia, which were so much needed by that country, where unemployment stood at more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zayev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive answer will be “the foundation of our prosperous future”.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, but that was below the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV channel revealed that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of that number claimed to vote positively.
For the referendum to take place, the turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policies of the pro-Western Government since it came to power last May.
Look, Sergio Aguero of Manchester City is running around Briton's defense to score a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling killed Briton's defense, leading Manchester City to a victory with a score of 2:0 on Saturday at Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored a goal for the 65th minute, it seemed like it was no trouble for him.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker was given a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran between the three Brighton protectors before breaking into open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green T-shirts.
He went through one defence counsel and overcame several others at the edge of the Briton penalty zone.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English attacker, while in the penalty zone, put Aguero's ball in one touch, which hit the right foot of the Gatekeeper "Brighton" Matthew Ryan in the right corner of the gate.
“Aguero has some leg problems,” said Coach Manchester City, Pep Guardiola, to the journalists.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored the goal at the time.”
But Sterling was the one who gave the Celestial Blues the initial advantage in fighting the Premier League.
That goal was full for the 29th minute.
In this game, Aguero won the ball, deep down in Briton's territory.
He gave a great cut on the left flank on Leroy Sana'a.
Sanae made a few touches before handing Sterling over to the long-distance trout.
The attacker, the Blue Sky, punched the ball in the gate right before flying out of the field.
Manchester City fought Hoffhenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 on the Rhine Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer's going to take the glasses from Colorado Rockies.
After the Washington Nationals withdrew from the playoffs, there was no reason to force events.
But the insatiable Sherzer hopes to win the fight against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Roxies, who are ahead of one Los Angeles Dodgers game in the Western Division, have problems in playoffs.
The 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday evening, the Rockies have already won at least 7 or 8 seats, but they still hope to secure their title in the first division.
“Although we play for nothing, at least we can hold our positions, knowing the immense importance of the Denver atmosphere in the presence of audiences and other teams, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss this?"
The Nationals have not announced the pitcher on Sunday, but the latest evidence suggests that Sherzer is inclined to play this role.
Sherzer, about to go to the 34th game, threw a ball at the pitcher's playground on Thursday, and on Sunday, on his day off, he'll be a pitcher.
==History==Washington's right-pitcher statistics are 18-7 with ERA 2.53 and 300 outs in 220 2/3 innings in the current season.
Trump's running an election race in West Virginia.
Referring to the importance of the Republicans appearing in the interim elections, the President implicitly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Cavanaugh, a presidential candidate for the Supreme Court.
“All that we did was at stake in November.
Five weeks left to one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's very, very important. I don't run, though I really run around fighting for good candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means they need, and we see abhorrentness and abhorrentness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to cross to gain power and control, which is what they want — power and control, but we're not going to give them.”
The Democrats, he claims, were designed to “oppose and obstruct”.
“And you've been watching it for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “vilest, vile, filthy and false.”
He referred to the Senate's Legal Committee, referring to Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which caused loud calls from the hall.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the contents of this document?
Um... um... what document?
No, no, the language of the body has given it away, and I have never seen the language of the body so disprove the words."
The Labour Party is no longer an organization with different views.
It does not tolerate those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party proposed a vote of distrust to me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of the members of Parliament from the Labour Party who have not yet been told that we are not welcome for expressing our views.
A similar attitude towards my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she was strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, a vote of distrust criticized me for dissenting Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security, Europe — ironically, these are issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham Eastern Labour Assembly notification on Friday stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Labour Party, the evening meetings of the GC were the same.
Unfortunately, today’s tone does not match many meetings, and the promise of “more human and soft” policies has long been forgotten, if ever.
The fact that there are no differences of opinion in the Labour Party is becoming increasingly evident, and each opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political perspective I previously considered to be similar to my own began to expect that I would radically change my views and take positions that I would never agree with — whether national security or a single EU market.
Every time I speak publicly — no matter what I say — there is a tirade of insults on social media calling for the annulment of the election, condemning the centre's policy, or claiming that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments to me are still tending to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face daily sexual or racist attacks, but never retreat.
What is most disappointing about this policy is the fact that this number of insults has become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “broad church,” and with every vote of distrust or change of rules of choice, the party is already becoming a party.
Over the past two years, I've received a lot of recommendations calling for me to sit down and cut my voice, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labourers 32 years ago, as a student of the school, outraged by the disregard of the Thatcher government, which has literally broken down my school class, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who need them most, whether it be the work of a local deputy or a government minister.
I never hid my political views, nor did I do it in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say the following: my country is moving so hard towards Brexit, which will guarantee economic, industrial and public losses, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Movement, but my voters, whether they are Labourers or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to cancel the election results or political expediency will prevent me from acting as I believe necessary in your interests.

Ear 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible Ear First
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Er has earned a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Tennent Premier League match.
Now they're leading the table, the only invincible team of tens.
After all, all thanks to their excellent protection, as well as their ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Merchi every right to be satisfied.
“The whole time we were tested for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad,” Peter Merchy commented.
Robin Christie, Melrose: "It's worth paying tribute to "R," they did better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Fraser Climo led the "Ear" forward, but the yellow card released for the "Wories" game by Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to move forward, and Jason Baggott grabbed the unrealized attempt.
Climo increased the "Ear" off the penalty line before, right in the middle of the game, earning a point and then making a single attempt during the break, making an account of 17-5 in favour of the "Ear".
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Baggot reduced the break to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the severe trauma of Ruarid Knott, who was stretched, and after re-entry, the "R" moved forward with the attempt by Stafford McDowell, carried out by Klimo.
Acting Captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card, and again Melrose forced the rivals to pay another player for Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt at the end of a violent period of pressure.
However, the owners returned, and when Strawan Hutchinson got a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without a ball from the line of the penalty line, MacPherson made a touchdown behind the coming Molo "R".
Climo realized an advantage without stopping almost from the very second exit after Kyle Rowe was struck by David Armstrong and sent the extreme attacker, Gregor Henry, to the fifth attempt of the field.
The Star Still Game is about to start a new career in the restaurant business.
Star Still Game Ford Kieran is about to start work in the hotel industry, and it has become known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, for which he is also writing, and is filmed along with a long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemfield.
Duett announced that the upcoming ninth episode would be the last on the show, and it looks like Kirnan's planning a life after Craigslist.
According to official information, he is director of Adriftmore Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan was planning to take part in the "blossing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
Our Sea: Land-locked Bolivia hopes that the Court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol a naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are blue flags on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are marked with the slogan: “The sea is our right.
It is our duty to return it.”
Throughout Bolivia, which is a landlocked country, the memory of the coastline lost in Chile ' s favour as a result of the bloody conflict of the 19th century over resources is still alive; the desire to navigate the Pacific Ocean again is alive and alive.
Those hopes may have been the most bold in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of an international court to be held on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and a balance of mind, and of course there is a positive outcome,” said Bolivia’s diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will observe the high-screening of the International Court of Justice throughout the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will be able to support Bolivia ' s statement that, after decades of intense negotiations, Chile has a duty to negotiate for Bolivia ' s sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, who is waging a difficult struggle for re-election next year, is also anxiously awaiting a decision on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and if so, it will not change much.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to administer Chilean territory and has already stated that it will have no effect on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was rendered only six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case “was not complicated”, says Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And for the past four years, the Bolivian case has not progressed, but has been delayed all the time.
“The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes”, Zarate says.
According to her, Morales’ war rhetoric destroyed the last Chilean kindness.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to engage in discussions.
These two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, Bolivia ' s representative in The Hague, disagreed that the court ' s decision had been delivered too quickly.
Monday will provide Bolivia with “a unique opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit”, he argues.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of Latin American’s most popular presidents, uses the naval problem as a political leverage.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he claims.
“The decision of the court is an opportunity to make sure once again that we need to move through our past.”
North Korea states that there will be no nuclear disarmament until it can trust the US.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young-ho states that his country will never destroy its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri addressed the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at the Singapore summit among its leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of a resumption of deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Eun in Singapore.
Ree claims that the dream that the long-term sanctions and the US objection to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever put the North on its knees is utopia.
Washington fears the adoption of this declaration if Pyongyang does not take substantial disarmament steps beforehand.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But the scepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the abandonment of the arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris's fashion show shows the latest line of massive headdresses that promise to appear in the mass market, and they'll be worn right next to you.
If you want to add your hats to your collection or fully protect yourself from sunlight, there's no need to look for anything else.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a variety of unusual headpieces that formed part of their SS19 collection and blinded fashion week visitors in Paris.
This summer, very impractical hats won the popularity of Instagram subscribers, and designers decided to send their stunning creatures to the podium.
A distinct copy of Valentino: The head beige decorated with broad feather-like fields was painted on model heads.
Other massive accessories included precious watermelons, a magician’s hat, and even pineapples, but all of these heads were not designed to warm their heads in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of bizarre masks, which had to be the eve of Halloween.
Many of these petal masks were sewn to their mouths, and they were more like Hannibal Lector's portrait than the creation of the coutures.
One of them was like underwater equipment with tubes and sunglasses, and the other was melting ice cream.
If you're a fan of high fashion, you're lucky.
Mode critics predict that these huge hats have every chance of getting into mass sales -- right to you.
The big hats follow the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with two foot wide fields, all of which have been worn from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The Cult label, which released this extremely impractical hat, which gained so much popularity on social media, produced and sent to the podium another huge accessory — a straw beach bag, almost as big as a bathing suit that carries the bag.
The orange bag of burnt raffia with a white leather pen and a line of raffia became a vivid copy of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 fashion week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage tells FEMAIL: “I think big hats and beach bags will appear in mass sale next summer, as the designer has made such a fuore with his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories.”
John Edward: Languages are of great importance to the citizens of the world
The Scottish independent schools continue their tradition of brilliant education, as confirmed again in 2018: outstanding examinations have demonstrated individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other socially important disciplines.
These schools belong to the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 pupils are enrolled throughout Scotland, and seek to provide the highest level of services for pupils and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their pupils for further higher education, career choices and status as citizens of the world.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the design and implementation of the individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you call upon his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, you speak to his heart.”
This is a convincing indication that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships with and trust the citizens of other countries.
From the latest examinations of this year, we see that languages are in the leading positions in the league tables and have the highest scores in the independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of foreign-language students received the highest A rating.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of pupils received “A” in Mandarin (Chinese language), while 72 per cent of students in German, 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish also received “A”.
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are clearly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Language subjects now enjoy the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill vacancies were a lack of language skills.
Language skills are thus increasingly becoming the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what kind of profession a student chooses if he learns a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future by acquiring another additional skill that he will benefit from throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages a competitive advantage.
According to a YouTube survey involving over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak the foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and French was the only language with two digits — 15 percent of respondents spoke it.
That is why investing in language education is so relevant now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of countries with emerging economies, would give children a better chance of finding a good job.
There is a wide variety of languages in Scotland’s schools that are taught — each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important to Britain in the light of the future development of the country before 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, in independent schools there will always be a choice of several languages with teaching staff whose members are specialists in these languages.
Independent schools in Scotland seek to create an educational environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of their future.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages remain vital to the future development of the country in the global business environment and should therefore be appropriately reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages really need to be seen as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, providing diversity and benefits for young people in Scotland.
Il faunt byen le fire.
John Edwards, Director, Board of Independent Schools of Scotland
LeBron debuts at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The dreary expectation of fans to see LeBron James perform for the first time at Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play a pre-season Sunday match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he still has to figure out how much time he's gonna have to take.
“More than one or less than forty-eight”, Walton replied on the official Lakers website.
"Lakers" reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six pre-season games on the Lakers chart.
“I do not need pre-season games to prepare for the season at this stage of my career,” the player answers.
Trump's election race in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of election meetings tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned meetings of Trump next week, including visiting friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on the candidate he had proposed for the post of Supreme Justice had been postponed, Trump was seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections, since the Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote was held in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Wiling, West Virginia, will take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting with West Virginia voters online on live YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at this week's hearing to nominate his candidate, Brett Cavanaugh, for the position of supreme judge, and Trump's proposal has generated a lot of negative reactions, since Cavanaugh was accused of sexual harassment, and the Senate vote to be held will be postponed until a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main purpose of this action is to help the Republicans entering the November elections to increase the electoral momentum.
President Trump's campaign is therefore aimed at helping to “energize the activities of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” writes Reuters.
“The control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president should visit as many states as possible, because we are entering a busy campaign season,” says the Trump campaign spokesman, who refused to be called, Reuters.
The action planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Wilinga can attract supporters from "...Ohio and Pennsylvania, and the attention of the Pittsburgh media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
This Saturday’s visit to West Virginia by Trump is the second visit to the state in the last month, where it gained the benefit of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump's trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate Patrick Morrisy, who's lagging behind in the polls.
“The fact that in order for Morrisy to get ahead of the poll competitors, the president must come — a bad sign for Morris himself,” says Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia (reuters citation).
Rider Cup 2018: The U.S. team is ready to fight and has hopes to go to a couple competition on Sunday.
After three unilateral sessions, the Saturday game two-to-two may have been exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The rolling initiative is an extraordinary fictional sporting concept, but it is in which players believe, and it is particularly pronounced in such competitions.
So who's taking the initiative?
“They had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I think it's a little initiative for us,” Jordan Spitt said.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage, and 12 more are at stake.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel the wind in sails, and they have reason to keep the spirit up, not least because of the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each can boast with three points out of four.
Sleeping was constant, from you to the green, and it was a personal example.
The winning shouts became louder as his round continued, pushing the decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when he and Thomas gave up two by two.
His blow, which gave them a victory in the game on the 15th hole, was met by a similar shout, one of the ones that speaks of his belief in a chance for the American team.
“We need to get together and focus only on our own game,” commented Spit.
That's all the players have left.
18 holes to win.
The only players who have earned more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly in the history of Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe beat four out of four, and they don't seem to know the mistakes.
Mollywood was the only couple that didn't get a boga on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the boga on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again on Friday morning.
This series and the way their energy seems to circulate between them and violent fans strengthens the belief that they will not be defeated on Sunday, and when the sun hides behind the horizon of the "Le Golf National" field, there will be no more famous player for Europe’s potential victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be nice if both were on different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to talk about Europe’s glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the four-ball morning hero, when he was in a couple with Alex Noren.
Boggs and two double boggs dug a Spaniard and a Swedish pit on the first nine holes, from which they were never able to get out.
So on Sunday, no one's gonna help you get out of your pit.
It's so exciting to watch a four-ball game and a four-player game because of the interaction between couples, the tips they exchange, and who deliberately keep quiet, and how the strategy can change in a moment.
So far, Europe has played better than a team, and it's made a lot of headway on the last day, but this session of the four has also shown that the US team has the strength to fight, which some, especially in America, doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads with a score of 10-6.
Europe will have a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after the completion of the four-ball and four-ball Saturdays with the top 10-6 over the United States.
Inspired duet Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against two victories against the fighting Tiger Woods to bring the bill to "Le Golf National" to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to recover the trophy lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American team's making mistakes in the four-ball morning games, winning the 3-1 score.
The US has shown more resistance in the fours, winning two matches, but it has not been able to narrow the gap in the account.
Jim Ferrick's team needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, were only the second pair to win four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into four balls, they then came together brilliantly to defeat the fallen Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechemo with even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who passed two Saturday matches, showed occasional glimpses, but now he lost 19 of the 29 games with four balls and a four in seven rows.
Justin Rose, who had rested before the four-ball game of the morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stanson in the four, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Capk with a score of 2/1, ranked first and third in the world.
For Europe, the game was not an easy and pleasant walk by a refreshing day southwest of Paris.
The three-time champion Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas made two points for Americans on Saturday.
They won a strong 2/1 victory against the Spaniards, John Ram and Ian Polter, in a four-ball game, and returned later to beat Polter and Rory McElroy with a 4/3 score in fours, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team got out of four points, walking out alone, considering that Feriq's team, as masters, had to play a crooked game to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of holding second place, the counterattack on Sunday looks like it's beyond their reach.
North Korea says that “kategorily” will not be disarmed unilaterally without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions had increased mistrust of the United States and that his country would never give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under any circumstances.
Ri Young-ho stated at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted “substantial goodwill measures” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of the nuclear test site and the commitment not to increase nuclear weapons stockpiles or develop nuclear technologies.
“However, the symmetrical reaction from the United States is not being observed,” he said.
“Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to take action unilaterally on disarmament.”
While Ri repeated North Korean complaints about Washington's “phased” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for step-by-step steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ree referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong-Eun and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the US President-in-Office and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June; Kim then promised to launch a movement towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula”, and Trump promised North Korea security assurances.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States states that Pyongyang must abandon its nuclear weapons first.
Washington is also resisting calls for the easing of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The US insists that “the denuclearization must begin” and increases pressure through sanctions to enforce its purpose and even opposes “the declaration of the end of the war”, says Ree.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the utopian dream of people who don't know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions reinforce our mistrust.”
Ree did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader mentioned at the United Nations early in the week.
Instead, the Minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae In over the past five months and added: “If South Korea, rather than the United States, were a party to the issue of denuclearization, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been so deadlocked.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s missile targeting on the United States mainland was inevitable after “Mr. President of Evil” Trump called Kim the “suicide missile.”
This year at the UN, Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea “fully” last year, commended Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that much remained to be done, and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that it did not indicate any time frame for this process: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and imperatively until we see full, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut off funding for Pyongyang ' s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly Summit and announced after that meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea had condemned him for “bang demands”.
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex, should the United States take “appropriate measures”.
According to him, Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he spoke of were the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest in special courses
The new course introduced this year at Harvard University helped all elementary students to learn to sleep more and to fight the chauvinist culture of uninterrupted caffeine consumption to keep awake “nights through.”
One of the academics found that the world’s most successful students often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital Clinic, developed a course that he considered to be the first in the United States.
After his discovery, he was aroused by the idea of introducing such a course, giving a preliminary report on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning processes.
"At the end of my presentation, a girl came to me and said, 'I'm sorry I only found out now that I'm about to finish my studies.'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first offered to students this year, shows how healthy sleep habits contribute to academic and sports achievement, and how it improves the general health of the individual.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University's Health Service, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after it had been determined that students had serious sleep deficiencies during the school week.
It lasts one hour, and the students perform a number of interactive tasks.
One section of the class offers an image of a dorm room where students, by clicking on coffee cups, curtains, gymnasiums, and books, learn how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light, which causes a lack of sleep — affect sports results and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
An interactive campus map encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behaviour of the students at once.
But we believe that they have a right to know, like any other person has a right to know, for example, how smoking affects his health,” Professor Chaseler added.
He said that a false sense of pride for being able to “smell all night” is still quite common, and modern technology, as well as increasing pressure on students, means that sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
According to him, enough sleep of good quality is the student's “secret weapon” to deal with stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to deal with overweight, because under-slapping puts the brain in a mode of hunger, making it constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian researcher in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler develop a course by attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to disseminate this information throughout the campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all postgraduate students to take a similar curriculum before entering a competitive educational institution.
Professor Chaisler recommends that students set up an alarm to warn them that they should go to bed and wake up, and that they should remember the harmful effects of the “blue light” produced by electronic screens and LED lamps, which disrupt human bioritm and lead to problems of sleep.
Livingstone 1-0 Rangers: Hall Menga wins over Gerrard's team
The Rangers experienced another sad retreat, as the goal of Dolly Meng led the unassembled team of Stephen Gerrard to a 1-0 defeat in Livingstone.
The Ibrox team hoped to win its first 4-1 victory in St. Johnston in February, but the Gary Holt team only defeated Gerrard of 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind, giving a light victory to the Harts team, the Scottish Premier League leaders.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who had lost their temper, did not seem to plan to settle the score.
While Rangers has now moved to number six, Livingstone has moved to number three, and only Hibernian has given way to the score ratio.
And Rangers may have additional problems after Liner Justice Kalum Spence had to heal a head wound after an object was thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight replacements for the team that went through "E" to the semi-finals for the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, in turn, embarked on the same strategy as Livy 11, which increased the gap with the Harts last week, and he would be pleased to see how his well-stressed composition had forced the opponents at every step.
Rangers may have been leading the sword, but Livingstone pressed much more when the ball hits them.
They were supposed to score the goal in just two minutes, when the first transmission to Meng Scott Pittman stopped Allan McGregor, but the parade took the chance.
Keegan Jacobs struck Captain Craig Hulkett with a fine, but his defense partner, Alan Litgow, was only able to send the ball to the back pan.
Rangers intercepted control, but in the last third, there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he was supposed to strike the penalty at 45 minutes when he and Stephen Lawless ran into each other, but Judge Stephen Thomson disagreed with the Colombian statement.
The Rangers were only hit two times in the first time, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about the hit by Lassan Coolibaly's head and the weak hit by Ovi Ejaria.
Although Livy's first goal, which was hit for the 34th minute, may not match the game, no one can deny that they earned it exclusively by their own work.
But again, Rangers failed to cope with the Jacobs game from its standard position.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried hard to get the ball to Meng for completion.
Gerrard started acting on the break when he switched Coolibaly for Ryan Kent, and that replacement almost immediately produced the result when the extreme defender gave pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his line to intercept.
But Livingstone continued to drag guests into a game they planned with Litgow and Halkett, constantly making long shows.
Holt's team tried to widen the breakout in the final stages, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Litgoe passed out from the corner of the field.
The reserve player, Glenn Middleton, once again demanded a penalty strike after he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson refused again.

And now the page of our almanac "Sunch Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, a future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
As one of the foundations of science, Geiger's meter also became one of the foundations of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film "Colocola Coronado", with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans — such seemingly unlike scientists — in the main roles:
Man: "What the hell is this thing?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger's meter, used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear the effects of atoms caused by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: "Here, I can hear you right now!"
He died in 1945 before his 63th birthday.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” abnormal cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” abnormally growing cells and kill them.
Part of the vaccine treatment is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions
As a result of this change, cells are able to “see” the type of protein that is characteristic of many cancers, and then cells must be reintroduced.
The test vaccine shows promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
One patient whose immune system has learned how to detect abnormal cells has been injected with ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells can “see” HER2 proteins, characteristic of many cancers, and then re-introduce the modified cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzoofsky, U.S. National Cancer Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, states: “The results we have received suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer.
A similar method was used successfully in the treatment of leukemia, which consisted of taking immune cells from patients and teaching them how to influence cancer cells.
Kanye West defended Trump in the MAGA cap after his appearance at SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was in the studio during a Saturday concert at which he spoke in defence of US President Donald Trump, claiming that he would resume his position in 2020.
After performing his third song, "The City Ghost", which he put on the cap "Make America Great Again", the performer gave a speech against the Democrats and supported Trump.
"Very often I talk to white people, and they ask me, "How can you support Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," the performer said.
The SNL channel made a parody show with Matt Damon in the lead role in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on Christina Blacey Ford's sexual harassment claims.
There was no television showing how the crowd was outraged by West’s speech, but this video was uploaded on social media by a comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to make West laugh.
In addition, West complained to the public that his hat had been mocked behind the scenes.
"They were messing with me behind the stage.
They say don't come out with that hat.
They were really messing with me!
Washington Examiner quotes: "They also said that my position was not cool."
West continues, "Do you want to know what's not cool? Put on a superman's cape so no one can tell you what to do? Do you want the world to continue to develop?
Then you need love."
His comments, at least twice, drew the attention of the audience, the members of the SNL acting team seemed confused, and one person said to the publisher, "The entire studio is in silence."
Westa was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariane Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of the song "I Love It" in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received the support of the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “One of the bravest people: SERVING TO SUPPORT MANY.”
Karen Hunter's talk show host tweeted that West was just "who he is, and that's absolutely great."
“However, I do not want to support anyone (buying his music, his clothes or otherwise supporting his creativity) who, in my view, shares and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
Like us,” she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, claiming that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Diddie, also known as Puff Duddy, Puffy and Pi Diddy.
His colleagues, the rapper Snoop Dog, originally had the name Snoop Lyon, and another example is, of course, an artist who recently became a legend, the Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder charge for scissors at the Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of stab wounds in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhakamor, as reported by the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Peace Court on Monday.
The charges will be heard by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
"The Game of Thrones" star Keith Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Keith Harington is known for his role as the swinging sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy show HBO "The Game of Thrones".
However, a 31-year-old actor recently critically criticized the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such characters often inspire young people to think that to be respected, you necessarily have to be violent.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that he believed that something went wrong and wondered how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married a colleague of his film "The Game of Thrones", Rose Leslie, who was his age, admitted that he was "inclined" to the problem.
“I personally take this question quite seriously: where are we wrong about the perception of masculinity?”, asks the actor.
"What do we teach young people that we have such a problem today?"
Keith believes that television can be partly responsible for this toxic masculinity because of too muscular characters.
The actor continues: “What is inborn and what is acquired?
What do they teach on television and on the streets, which makes young men feel that they should only show one certain aspect of masculinity?
I think this is really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because there's really something wrong with young people today.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not take part in any adjectives or sequels of the Game of Thrones after the show ended next summer, saying that he had “finished the battles and the horses.”
Since November, Keith will play a leading role in the re-enacting "The True West" by Sam Shepherd, who talks about the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently announced that he believed that meeting Rose's wife was the best finale of the Game of Thrones for him.
"I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my future life," says the actor.
Rose played the Player, the subject of the passion of Keith John Snow in a Phenthesian series awarded by Emmy.
The couple celebrated a wedding in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health representatives, more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering from these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, sexually transmitted diseases showed a change in trends in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV infections in this way has been virtually zeroed, and Chinese health representatives stated at a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 annually.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is still widespread.
Studies confirm that because of the country ' s conservative values, 70 to 90 per cent of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
In many cases, transmission is due to insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refutes the leak of information from the Republican Senators complaining of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Member of the U.S. Parliament, Maxine Waters, rejected charges on Saturday that one of her employees had posted personal information to three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The L.A. Democrat claims that the claims were forged by ultra-right experts and websites.
“Liables, lies, and even more vile lies,” Waters tweets.
It is reported that the published information includes home addresses and telephone numbers of US senators, Lindsay Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during hearings before the Senate Sexual Harassment Commission against a candidate in the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after three senators interviewed Cavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identified the source of the messages was linked to Waters' office, and released information about Waters' employees, reports Hill.
“This unfounded claim is totally false,” Waters assures us.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent acts was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded claim is a complete lie.”
Waters’ statement immediately provoked criticism on the Internet, including by former White House Spokesman Ari Fleisher.
“It's an angry denial,” Flösher writes.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for working in Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why be angry?
You don't have to explain yourself either.
And you shouldn't be looking at the motives of the prosecutors either.
We must remain calm and cold.”
Flesher seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during the Thursday hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters in the midterm elections, also made his point on Twitter.
“If it's true, it's very important,” he writes.
In his statement, Waters wrote that her office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent acts.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are found,” she writes, “and that they are legally responsible for all their actions that can be destructive and dangerous to all of my employees.”
Johnny English strikes again-- weak impression on Rowan Atkinson's spy.
Today, it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which Britain appears in one way or another; this is also true of the new "Agent Johnny English" spies franchise, which began production as early as 2003 and continued in 2011 with "Agent Johnny English: Rebooting".
Will a self-inflicted picture with a "we're all shit" label become a new national export attempt?
In any case, Johnny English, a big-eyed profan with a rubber face, got his right to chaos for the second time — his name is the most glaring hint that he is a broad screen comedy designed for a non-English film audience.
The hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims for a glamorous smoothie, got a little Clouseau, Mr. Bean's traits, and a portion of this guy who put one single note in the Chariots of Fire melody in London in 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
Originally, the character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveler and the mysterious “international” Atkinson, who once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, in which the hero left himself in complete chaos.
There's one or two nice moments in this last issue of JE.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the blades popped on his helmet.
Yes, it shows Atkinson's gift to physically perform comedy scenes, but humor itself seems rather weak and strangely unnecessary, especially because “serious” motions such as Agent 007 and Mission Impossible are now confidently offering comedy as an element.
It feels like humor is designed for children, not adults, and for me, Johnny English's bizarre evils are not as ingenious and appropriate as Atkinson's jokes in Mr. Bean's movies.
The constant message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker broke into a top-secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the duty agent Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, had an occasional role to play.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, a pompous and violent figure already suffering from enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best for the character Quasi-Teresa-May, but there's nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisors tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to remove someone from retirement.
Here comes the clumsy Johnny English himself, who now works as a school teacher in some fancy establishment, but also gives informal lessons on secret operations: there are some good jokes here, because English offers the skills of a "rock" spy academy.
English is going back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his ex-smart buddy Buff, who is playing by Ben Miller this time.
Buff is now a married man under the command of the submarine, the role of the “jolly hockey clubs” in which Vicki Pepperdin is lost a little.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game because Her Majesty's secret service has made terrible mistakes, and they face a beautiful, fatal woman, Ophelia Bulletova, in the performance of Olga Kurilenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously enchanted by a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems — the ominous Jason Volta, who Jake Lacey plays.
Anglish and Baf begin their odyssey of farce jokes: disguised as waiters, they burn up a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on the luxurious Jacht of Volta; Anglish creates a complete anarchy, trying to use the garnish of virtual reality to get acquainted with the interior of Volt’s home.
All these scenes are, of course, a nice and fancy fiction, but there's something very childish about all of this.
Quite moderate things.
And like other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but think, can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role commensurate with his talent?
Laborers deny that they are developing a plan to reduce the British working week to four days for a five-day wage.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, but pay in five days.
The party reportedly wants company leaders to give workers savings from the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an extra day off.
This would allow staff to enjoy three days off for the same salary.
Sources reported that the idea was “incorporated” into the party's economic agenda and that it would help the population to become part of the workforce.
The Congress of Trade Unions has approved a four-day working week so that workers can benefit from a changing economy.
A high source of the Labour Party said The Sunday Times: It is expected that the policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is our goal, which is in line with the party's approach to changing the balance sheet in the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its campaign in 2017.
However, this desire is currently not endorsed by the majority of the Labour Party.
A representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to specify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to take power from “faceless directors” and “speculants” of utility firms.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that current water canal shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Labour Government may make “deducts” on the basis of alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in company boards and establish Inclusive Overseas Funds to transfer 10 per cent of private sector capital to workers who could receive an annual dividend of up to Pound500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes," if the FBI investigation into Cavanaugh can change their mind.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the post of supreme judge for at least a week and raised the question of whether the findings of the agency could encourage any of the Republican senators to support Cavanaugh.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham to see if the FBI could find anything to make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy replied.
“When I went to the meeting, I said I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that information came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
His answer was decisive, definite and unequivocal.”
But Graham's opinion on the vote remained firm.
“I have made a firm determination about Brett Cavanaugh, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments comparable to dynamite,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I know for sure is that Brett strongly denied it all,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blacey Ford.
“No one she called as witnesses could confirm these facts either.
It's been 36 years.
And I didn't see anything new about it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an impressive star composition with an equally impressive mission — the end of poverty around the world.
For the seventh year of the Festival of World Citizens, as tens of thousands of people, have flowed to the large lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but also to highlight the real goal of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which was opened in 2012, is a follow-up to the global anti-poverty project undertaken by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you're not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you had to volunteer or send an e-mail to the world leader, make a phone call or do any other or other meaningful action to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the World Citizens' Festival in 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people by freely attending a concert really convincing fellow citizens to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” where people believe that they are making real changes by signing an online petition or tweeting messages?
The organizers of the Global Citizen claim that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” by its supporters have been registered at the festival, with many different goals.
It is mentioned that, as a result of these actions, world leaders have pledged more than $37 billion, which is expected to affect the lives of more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided directly to nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most significant commitments is The Power of Nutrition: The British Partnership of Investors and Introducers committed to “helping Children to Realise Their Full Potential” pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help put an end to malnutrition in the district, after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments, and Global Cities, such as you, we can do social injustices to the malnutrition of past history,” said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions had been taken to encourage Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government had announced funding for the Nutrition Power Project, which would reach 5 million women and children through nutrition improvement activities.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival's website, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The organizers of the Global Citizen say, "This will be a long and difficult journey where we will trip and fall from time to time.
But, as in the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Jeanelle Monet, are some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, with Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman leading the event.
The US can use the navy for “blocks” to prevent the export of Russian energy: the Minister of the Interior
US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has stated that Washington can use its navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia's presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy as they do in Eastern Europe, southern Europe,” he says.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to open sea lanes and, if necessary, to block their energy from entering the market,” the Minister says.
Zinke reached out to an event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that stands for itself as the voice of the U.S. energy consumer.
He further compares Washington’s approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is the more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel,” says the minister, calling Russia a “one trick,” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements were made in connection with the Trump administration ' s commitment to increasing the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which offered a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump’s administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Northflow-2 pipeline project that Trump said made Berlin a “minder” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Flow-2 project, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s violent resistance to the project is based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“Emphasizing that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said the Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Nowak, after meeting with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists in the Federation of German Industry (BDI) called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third state intervenes in our supply of energy, it poses a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts will carefully explore the possibility of running for president in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts announced on Saturday that he would carefully explore the possibility of running for the presidency after the interim election.
At a meeting of the city duma in Holioca, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would think about participating in the election race.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and it takes a woman up there,” Warren The Hill says.
“After 6 November, I will carefully consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren's appreciation for President Donald Trump's performance during the meeting was that he “will lead this district in the wrong direction”.
“I'm so worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an open critic of both Trump himself and his candidate for the position of Supreme Justice Brett Cavanaugh.
In his Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, we need to investigate the FBI before we start voting."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most voters, Warren himself, do not think that she should run for election in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Studies, 58 percent of the "probable" voters of Massachusetts stated that the senator should not run.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents, on the other hand, supported her plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in elections and 48 per cent opposed elections.
Other known Democrat names discussed in the 2020 perspective include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden claims that he will make an official decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin told me about Trak Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at a meeting with Donald Trump's voters.
Track Palin, 26 years old, joined the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is now suffering the same as other families who have suffered PTSD-related injuries and our soldiers have returned with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as “a bell in the eye” and said of her son and other veterans of the war: “They are already returning with other people who are burned, asking whether their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other military personnel they have given their country the same respect.”
Trak Palin was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with family violence against a woman, interfering with the situation of violence and possession of weapons intoxicated by alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and D.C. support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy, which prohibits shelter for victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts filed an analysis note in Washington on Friday by a court consultant on support for an asylum seeker challenging the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband “and his sons, who are members of a criminal group”, ill-treated her, but on 20 July, U.S. officials rejected her asylum request.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have a large number of applications for asylum in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The U.S. new asylum policy reversed the decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Racine, stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “has ignored decades of application of State, federal and international law”.
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be heard on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition violates this principle”, states the report of the judicial consultant.
Lawyers also argue that policies prohibiting immigrants are detrimental to the US economy, emphasizing that this category of citizens is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labour”.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sashnes ordered immigration judges no longer to provide shelter to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
“The shelter will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” said Sashnes in his statement of 11 June.
This instrument has never been designed to solve all the problems, even the most serious ones that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Pala: the number of deaths is doubled in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly difficult.
“It's very difficult now,” says 35 - year - old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick baby in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Emergency is bringing in the wounded every minute.
Clean water is in great deficit.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig into wet things, and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by an earthquake of 7.5 were overburdened.
Some of the wounded, including Movi Haris, who had a fractured spine and shoulder, were resting near Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated in the open air because they were forced to leave the premises because of the continuing strong push.
He's crying, remembering how a massive earthquake destroyed a hotel room on the fifth floor he was filming with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I was pushed into the debris of the wall, ” says Haris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they've escaped and they're all right now.”
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “attacks” carried out through “advertising”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a daily American newspaper about the mutual benefit of US and China trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to a fee-based supplement to Des Moins Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper in Iowa, accusing China of attempting to intervene in the US Congress elections on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to intervene in the US elections is proof of the fact that US officials told Reuters: a new phase is under way in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is the norm for foreign governments to advertise for trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are now in a state of escalation of trade war, resulting in the equalization of tariffs on imports by their countries.
China’s response rates at the beginning of the trade war were to strike exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, were announced by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major agricultural exporter to China, claims that Beijing damaged American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in Sunday’s Sunday magazine Des Moins Register, “now doubles this harassment by posting propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses our heart-loving American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, paying and posting ads at Des Moines Register,” writes Branstad.
“However, in the newspaper kiosks here on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear dissenting voices, and you will not see the true diversity of views that the Chinese could learn about China’s worrying economic policy, because the local media are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he writes.
He added that one of the most famous Chinese newspapers had “switched away” from the proposal to publish his article, although it did not give the exact title of the publication.
Analysts warn: Cavanaugh divisive Republicans repel women voters on the eve of the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to stand aside and defend the candidacy of Supreme Justice Brett Cavanaugh despite several allegations of sexual violence, and analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially from women, that may affect the forthcoming interim elections.
Emotions about this situation have escalated to the extreme, and most Republicans have officially declared that they want to continue voting.
You can’t go back to such things later, ” writes Grant Rier, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's attempts to investigate the FBI at the very last minute will be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn newspaper Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November ahead!” in front of the Senate, when Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to nominate Cavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blacie Ford’s testimony, reported to Mick.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the bounds,” stated non-partisan politician Stu Rotenberg on the news site.
“People say that the situation is already getting bad enough, and it's true.
But things can get worse, especially in terms of female voters in suburbs and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the President, often do not vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate for the position of supreme judge, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts assumed that if the Republicans confirmed the nomination, that step could trigger a retaliatory reaction.
“This is already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It is not only about voting in a committee or a final vote, or whether Cavanaugh is sitting on the bench, but also about how the Republicans deal with it as they do,” says Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, a news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided on whether they believe in Ford or Cavanaugh, and tend a little bit more to the latter.
A new YouTube poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe ford’s testimony accurately or most likely, while 35 percent say they believe Cavanaugh accurately or most likely.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Cavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same thing about Ford.
At the insistence of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's charges, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramírez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Law Committee that Cavanaugh, while intoxicated, attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the position of Supreme Judge showed her his genitals at the party during her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on an open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, it was a joke that the goal of Inrupt was to gain “peaceful domination.”
“We must do it now,” he says about his startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses the Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "personal online data warehouses" or POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, cases, as well as a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional data tools.
The application is based on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all of which can be used in the same browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online data repository is that it is fully managed by the user, who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “personal empowerment through data”.
According to the CEO of John Bruce, the Inrupt idea was that the company provided resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company is now composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a volunteer programmer community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether or not his companies should make radical changes that would change all their business models overnight.
“We do not ask them for permission.”
In his post on Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee's voice has been quite influential in the debate about online neutrality.
Even by launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Church minister awarded by Victoria’s Cross during World War I
In the history of the Church of England, only one warrior priest was awarded the Cross of Victoria during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his home city 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this award on September 29, 1918 for participating in the attack on Bellenglis and Løkur.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received the highest British military award.
The memorial to this event was inaugurated by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vanne, said that it was “very symbolic” that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vann conducted his battalion through the Saint-Kanten Canal “in a very dense fog and under heavy fire of field guns and machine guns”.
Later, he rushed into the line of fire and “with the greatest courage” led the group forward and then threw a field gun with one hand, shooting down three soldiers of the unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanne was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, a 72-year-old grandson of the hero, said that “he could hardly have done the same heroic thing, but it's depressing.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vanne, also laid a wreath at the end of the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vanne said that “he is honoured to take part in the parade” and added that “the worthiness of a true hero is confirmed by the support that will be given by many people.”
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they showed them Peppu's pig.
Imagine you didn't sleep all night to watch the full Bellator 206, but you weren't allowed to see the main event.
The San José table contained 13 battles, including six major battles, and the battles were broadcast live all night on Channel 5 of British Television.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, the British fans were stunned to see Peppa's Pig on screen.
Some fans were not impressed at all because they hadn't slept until morning precisely to watch the battles.
One of the Twitter fans called this a change to a children's cartoon "some kind of sick joke."
“There was a government decree that at 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to children's programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President Bellator for Marketing and Communication, when asked why it happened.
"Yes, Pep's Pig."
Bellator's president Scott Coker said that they planned to draw up a schedule so that future battles could also be seen by British viewers.
“As far as re-showing is concerned, I think we can solve this,” says Coker.
"But there's Sunday, six o'clock in the morning, and we can't solve this until Sunday by our time, and it's Monday for them.
But we'll do our best.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, there was a lot of text messages, and they were all far from friendly.
We were trying to solve this problem right away, and we thought it was some kind of technical failure.
Turns out it wasn't, it was a matter of national importance.
I promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans, we're trying to increase that number, but it's too much.
Yes, it didn't work well."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt inferior because of his sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he grew up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what got him motivated to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that "not all are like him" until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs programme led by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that the victory at the Olympics was less important to him after he had a baby.
Kirsty Young, a permanent host of the multi-year show, took a few months off due to illness.
Daily, who was the main guest in Laverne's program, said that he felt “smaller than any of his peers” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.
He says: “To date, these feelings of impoverishment and inappropriateness have been real, but they have given me strength, and I have succeeded.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something" so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexual orientation.
The two-fold bronze Olympic medalist became a famous LGBT activist and, at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had expressed his opinion because he was lucky to be able to live an open life without consequences and wanted to give others hope.
Three times the world champion said that the feelings for the man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “was caught by surprise.”
Last year, Daly married Oscar's winner, who is 20 years older than him, but claims that the age difference was never a problem.
“If there is so much going on in your life at this young age,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, “it is hard to find a peer who has the same radically opposite experience of life.
The couple became parents in June, and they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daly, and Daly said that "all his world view" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I need to win a gold medal," says the athlete.
"But you know what, there are more important things than the gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daily told me that his father didn't want to accept his death, and one of his last requests was first-line tickets to the London 2012 competition.
"I couldn't say to him, "Daddy, you'll be gone, and you won't be able to sit there in the front row," says Daly.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing, I finally realized that he wasn't invincible,” says the athlete.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that this is what I've dreamed of my whole life — diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling,” he says.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song, Proud by Heather Small, which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still likes him so much.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15, English Summer Time.
Michelson, not in uniform, spent this Saturday on the Rider Cup on the bench.
American Phil Miquelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to pull up his uniform to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
Michaelson, who played biennal for the record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Furic to the bench on Saturday for four balls and four.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as was often the case in the United States, a five - time major winner shared his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in the hope of correcting his concerns.
Never with the most direct blow, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete is not the perfect candidate for the hard track Le Golf National, where a long raft usually punishes for inaccuracies.
And if the course in itself is not quite scary enough, Michelson will meet in the ninth match on Sunday with the exact British Open Francesco Molinari, who joined with the newest Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in the 12 singles make a big start, the Michelson game can be decisive.
Feriq expressed confidence in his partner, although he could say more.
“He fully understood the role assigned to him today, applauded me on the back, hugged me, and said he would be ready tomorrow,” said Feriq.
“He's pretty confident, too.
He's a walking Hall of Fame, and he's done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there with all of them."
On Sunday, Michelson will break Nick Foldo's record for the number of matches in Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of his career in Ryder Cup, which never matched his individual record.
Michelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven nobodys, although Feriq said that his presence was of great benefit to the team.
“He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to bully people, and he's a great guy who's interesting,” he explained.
"I think the young players had fun with him this week, and it was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game.”
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the great advantage may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows in his experience that significant leadership in the single-handed Rider Cup can easily turn into an unfavourable direction.
Dutchanine debuted in 1997 in Walderram, where the team led by Severiano Ballesteros had an advantage of five points over the Americans, but overcame the finish line only a little ahead with the smallest difference, winning 141⁄2–131⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Walderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderram, where we won, but just so far,” said Bjorn, who was photographed after watching the 2018 Class, winning on the Le Golf National field with an score of 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, which resulted in an score of 10-6.
So history will prove to me and the entire team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll be on full force.
Go and do it right.
As long as the score is not on the table, it's not over.
We have a goal, and this is a chance to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I spoke with no silence, focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we already know that what we are against is the greatest players in the world.”
Bjorn said, "I would never have surpassed myself in this.
There's a different test tomorrow.
Tomorrow, individual performances start, and that's a different matter.
It's always nice to be around your partner when things are going well, but when you're left alone, you're testing all your strength as a professional golfer.
That is the idea that the players need to be inspired to make their own tomorrow.
Now the partner remains behind, and he too must make every effort.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Feriq, believes that his individual players will be better than their partners, except Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Feriq himself passed the last few days of this carousel, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he finally lost when Europe held the Miracle in Medina.
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to finish it as quickly as you did in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it puts great pressure on the middle of the match.
We designed our game plan accordingly and set the kids up as we thought they were right, you know? Tomorrow we'll try to do a miracle."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the resistance by meeting Rory McElroy in the top-mast with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ayan Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
“I have chosen this group of guys, and in this order, because I think that this way they will cover all possible shortcomings,” Bjorn said, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The commissioning of a new German warship has been rescheduled
The newest frigate of the German fleet was to be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the cold war era, but this will not happen at least next year due to defective systems and lavinic cost increases, reports the local media.
The entry into operation of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the main ship of a completely new Baden-Württemberg class frigate, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit with a reference to a military representative.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that had arisen since the shipment had complicated the fate of an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aged Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, they will have a powerful cannon, numerous anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some Steel technologies — such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods — it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant postponement of entry means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, will become obsolete by the time they become operational, notes Die Zeit.
The villain F125 fell into the news headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to operate the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the ship builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “programme and hardware defects” that made a warship useless when used in combat.
The lack of software was particularly critical, as the Baden-Württemberg class would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors — only half of the workforce in the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to be too heavy, reducing its productivity and limiting the ability of the Navy to implement future renovations.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of keeping the latest frigates at anchor are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings about Germany’s naval power reduction.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the naval forces were actually ending up with a stock of ships capable of deploying.
The official said that the problem had escalated over time because old ships had been decommissioned, but they had not been provided with vessels to replace them.
He visited that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates could ever be taken into service by the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study carried out in one of the Scottish hills is designed to show how bats use the landscape to find food.
It is hoped that the data will provide a new insight into the behaviour of unique winged mammals and help to further preserve species.
A study organized by the National Foundation of Scotland will examine common non-topys, sopranos, and brown long-haired bats and Dobanton nights, inhabited by Inverewe Gardens, West Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at some locations around the site to track bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile site surveys using manual detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of screams and the activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
A habitat map will then be drawn up and a report prepared to provide a detailed picture of their landscape-wide behaviour.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Nature Conservation Adviser, hopes that these results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of habitat management, such as grassland formation, as well as how to maintain forest areas in a state optimal for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout Britain has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened with extinction due to construction and development work that affects their habitat and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can be dangerous, as well as adhesive fly ribbons, chemical processing of building materials and hunting of domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They're using sophisticated echo equipment to pinpoint the obstacles on their way to flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the issue of the bat population very seriously.
The organization has 10 trained experts who conduct regular interviews, field checks and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has even created the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland at Threave Mansion in Damfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of Scottish bats live.
The real estate manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the perfect place for them.
"Here, in Threave, a great place for bats," he says.
"There are old buildings here, many old trees and all the elements of a good environment.
But much about bats remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need to live well.”
It recalls the importance of testing the presence of bats prior to maintenance within private domains, as the unintentional destruction of one nest could lead to the death of up to 400 females and young persons, and possibly even to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected by law, their destruction, harassment or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the bat conservation fund, appeals to the public for help.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how many of their individual species live."
Ronaldo denies charges of rape, and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo denies the rape charges against him, calling them “feek news”, and asserts that people simply “want to propiarize” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Spiegel, which has published charges against a football player.
Forward Portugal and Juventusa were accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga, who allegedly occurred in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, reported it to "Spiegel" on Friday.
In a video on Instagram, where a football player had 142 million followers, a few hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the information "feek news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all fake news,” claims the five-time winner of Ballon d'Or on camera.
"They just want to pry with my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's just part of their work.
I am a happy man, and I'm doing great," adds the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue "Spigel" for the charges they called "inadmissible information on suspicions of confidentiality", according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Shertz stated that the player intended to claim compensation for “moral damage in an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the legal breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting him at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in anal form, according to documents filed with the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident Ronaldo fell on her knees and told her that he was “99% good, but one percent bad.”
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was consensual.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and that the hospital took pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt “a fear of revenge” and was afraid of “public humiliation”.
A 34-year-old woman says that she is now trying to change her place of residence because she continues to experience traumatic feelings as a result of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved on to the Italian giant Juva in a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: Britain “repents for automakers lost forever”
The Secretary of Business and Enterprise, Greg Clark, stated that the UK would “repent for it forever” if, after Brexit, it lost its status as world leader in car production.
He also commented on information that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Bernaston factory, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” says Mr. Clarke.
The Japanese automaker stated that the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit transaction could result in job losses.
The Bernaston plant produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain withdraws from the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped,” says Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, states that it will close the Mini production plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to automotive manufacturers, if there is no Brexit supply chain transaction, the supply chain will be at high risk.
The Toyota production line is launched “at the exact time” and the parts for the vehicles manufactured for the purchase are supplied every 37 minutes by the British and EU suppliers.
If Britain withdraws from the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border that, according to the industry, may result in delays and shortages of parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store stocks at its Derbyshire plant for more than one day, and the production will therefore be stopped.
Mr. Clarke said that Teresa May's plan, described in Checkers, for future relations with the EU “is precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
“We need a deal. We want to make a better deal that will not only allow us to succeed now, but also take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he said on BBC Radio 4, “Today.”
“Not only Toyota, but also other producers argue that we must be absolutely capable of continuing the successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not specify the duration of the production stop, but in the longer term warned that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tswallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the leader of the factory's union, says that the concern of the organization's members is growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we will no longer be able to return them.”
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
Donald Trump’s meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “rescheduled for another week”, as the struggle for Brett Cavanaugh’s candidacy for the position of Supreme Justice continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Müller, who investigates Russia’s intervention in elections, the links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and potential obstacles to the President’s justice.
Whether Trump dismisses the Deputy Attorney General, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, there has been a lot of speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refutes this information.
However, last Monday he went to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he “would prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judicial Committee, where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blacie Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into FBI complaints against Cavanaugh, which further delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's Spokesman, Sarah Sanders, spoke at Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of the meeting has not yet been set, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other developments in the Supreme Court.”
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders has not briefed the White House since 10 September.
Lead Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says that the absence of briefings is not due to the “discretion of the community” of television reporters, although she added: “I will not deny that they play in public.”
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The President holds more meetings to answer questions from journalists than any other president before him,” she added, but did not give the exact figures: “We have these numbers.”
Sanders assured me that the briefings would continue, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.”
We're trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we've had in the past few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it's a worthy replacement for press briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
Conferences are rare for the press alone.
The free, and sometimes strange, behavior of the president in front of the gathered journalists this week in New York may be the answer to why.
The Minister of Health writes a letter to EU employees in Scotland about concerns about Brexit.
The Minister of Health has approached EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude on behalf of the entire country and to wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, wrote this letter to the employees less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to defraying the cost of processing status applications for EU citizens serving in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between Britain and the EU on withdrawal continued during the summer and the expected decision is due this fall.
However, the British government is also strengthening preparations for a possible scenario with no transactions.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
It is therefore now that I wish to emphasize once again how much I appreciate the contribution of every staff member, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie had a head injury emergency.
Michael Organe of Tennessee reported that the deputy defender of Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, had undergone an emergency operation after having suffered head injury on Saturday after the 31–27 hit with the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Chief Trainer of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told journalists that the injury was sustained shortly before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just collapsed there," Reid said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting it on the stretcher and taking it to a medical examination.
An official from Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details on the type/phase of the injury so far”, and in Tennessee, they are trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, who only entered the second year, it was the first season of Tennessee State to move from Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully intercepted five balls, which amounted to 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp fee when buying real estate in Britain.
According to Tori’s new plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp charge when buying real estate in the UK, and the additional money recovered will be used to help the homeless.
This step will negate Corbin's attempts to attract young voters
An increased stamp charge will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in Britain.
Treasury expects it to raise up to £120 million a year for the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher stamp charge when buying real estate in Britain, and the additional money they have secured will be used to help the homeless — something that Teresa May will announce today.
This step will nullify Corbin ' s attempts to attract young voters, who promise to make housing more accessible and to increase the income of citizens.
Higher stamp fees will be levied on non-tax individuals and firms in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds thus generated should stimulate the Government ' s efforts to assist homeless citizens.
The addition to existing stamp collections, including increases introduced two years ago for the purchase of secondary and rental housing, may amount to up to 3 per cent.
Treasury expects that this step will provide up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new real estate in London is not purchased by British residents, resulting in higher prices and making it difficult for buyers who buy their first dwelling to improve their housing conditions subsequently.
Many of the country’s elite areas, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers who, by buying housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp collection to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction firms of squandering real estate prices by acquiring land, but not actually using it, and urged Ms. May to abandon the quota for affordable housing to correct the “famous housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms, which would include monitoring rents and ending unjustified evictions.
It also wishes to give local governments more authority to build new houses.
Ms. May stated: “I said last year that I dedicated my premiere to the fulfilment of the British dream — to make life better with every new generation.
This means, among other things, solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build lives here.
However, it is not fair that for non-British citizens, as well as foreign companies, the acquisition of real estate is as affordable as for hardworking British people.
For too many people, the dream of acquiring their own home has become too far away, and the threat to some to be on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland."
The Sunderland club's boss, Jack Ross, says that his "final goal" is to become a Scottish manager at a certain point.
A 42-year-old Scotser enjoys the rebirth of the North East Club, which is now ranked third in the first league, separating it from the top with three points.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got the hat B, and that's it," Ross Sportsound BBC Scotland said.
“But I grew up watching Scotland with my father in the Hamptons as a child, and it always attracted me back.
However, this will be possible only if I can become a successful manager of the club.”
Ross' predecessors, Sunderland managers were also Dicka Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardides, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athletic says that he was not trembled with such authoritative names in such large clubs, earlier rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at this point will depend on whether I can get this club back to the Premier League.
According to its structure and capabilities, this club certainly belongs to the Premier League,” says the coach.
“It is not an easy task to get him out there, but I will think I've done my job only if I can get the club back.”
Ross only served as manager for three years, first becoming assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spending 15 months at Hearts' coaching headquarters.
He then helped Alloa rise from level three, and in the next season, he led St Mirren down to win the championship.
Ross claims that he is more comfortable today than ever during his game career in Clide, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls his responsible work at Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that management was more appropriate than a game.
That sounds weird, because I've done everything well, I've earned a lot of money in this position, and I've made some progress.
But the game is harder.
There's a lot of things to do weekly.
I'm still under stress at work, but I feel good at running.
I've always wanted to lead, and now, by doing this, I feel most comfortable as a fish in water for my entire adult life.”
You can listen to a full interview on SportsOUND on Sunday, September 30, on Scotland's radio from 12:00 to 13:00 on English Summer Time.
According to the poll, 5:30 is the perfect time for a pint of beer.
The heat of the summer has increased sales of British pubs, but has lowered sales in restaurant networks.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consulting Company, who received the statistics, says: “Long-term solar activity and longer-than-expected English participation in the World Cup means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8 per cent and in restaurants, on the contrary, declined significantly.”
The June decline in income in restaurant trade by 1.8 per cent also continued in July.
Drinking pubs and bars have shown much better results in restaurants.
Pubs selling only food also suffered from the heat of the sun, though not as much as restaurants.
Seems like people just want to go outside to get a drink.
The sale of beverages in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent in a month and the sale of food by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in the leisure and hotel industry, says: “These results have continued the trend we have seen since late April.
The weather and influence of major social or sporting events remain critical when it comes to sales on the non-profit market.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, especially since a 4.8 per cent annual decline in sales will be particularly painful due to ongoing price pressures.
A long hot summer has turned out more than ever to be for food operators, and it is not yet a fact that August, by bringing more moderate temperatures, will give much needed rest.”
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened restaurants, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slower decline in the closing of brands.
Monitoring the commercial sales of the Coffee Peach Tracker for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses the productivity data of 47 networks with a combined turnover of over Pound9 billion and is a recognized industry benchmark.
One in five kids has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
According to the survey, one in five children — some of them only 11 years old — have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the pages of the "feek insta"
This news has heightened concerns about sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "primary" account that parents knew about.
However, one in five children — some of them only 11 years old — create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fake “insta” accounts, i.e., the Instagram, a photo exchange site.
This news has heightened concerns about sexual content publications.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a primary, clean account that their parents had access to, but also secret accounts.
One mother who accidentally accessed her 13-year-old daughter's secret account ran into a teenager who called on others to rape him.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two social media profiles, half of whom admitted that one of them was generally secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan says, "Many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that are not accessible to their parents and teachers, and that's an alarming fact."
Aileed Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" of Scottish light athletes.
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Aileed Doyle was elected to the board of directors of Scottish light athletes as an observer member of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most famous athlete in light athletic, and President Ian Beatty argues that this is an excellent opportunity for sports managers to benefit from the extensive experience of athletes at the international level over the past decade.
“Aileed has great respect in the Scottish, British, and world-wide light athletic community, and we are confident that her participation will be of great benefit to athletics in Scotland,” says Beatty.
Doyle says, "I want to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really make a good contribution and promote sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has a total of four gold Olympic medals, and now works as a regular commentator for BBC, losing his ability to walk after a stroke.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I've lost my ability to move.
The doctors said that only time will tell me if I'm going to recover, and if so, to what extent.
It was an exhausting job, but I've fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing a crafty exercise!
Thank you so much for your support!"
The milk sucker’s advertisement, in which nursing mothers were compared to cows, shared the views of Internet users
The milk-sucking company has raised disputes on the Internet by publishing advertisements that compare breastfeeding mothers with milk cows.
By releasing on the market, as they say, “the world’s first silent milk sucker that can be carried on its chest,” Elvie’s consumer technology company published an advertising music video demonstrating the freedom that the new milk sucker gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real moms dance in full hay under a music track, saying, "Yes, I'm feeding my own milk, but you won't see my tail," and, "If you haven't noticed, it's not owl, it's my breasts."
And then the choir: "Healing, healing, we feed our babies with breast milk, we heal, we heal."
This commercial, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: The video received mixed reactions from the audience, with many saying that it sheds light on the dairy industry’s distresses.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are taken away from them within days of birth,” writes one user.
Elvie's milk pump is dressed directly under a special bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is clear that it is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a milk sucker for mothers who keep their children?"
Another user adds: “advertisements detached from reality”.
Others, on the other hand, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was “just great”.
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was feeding the baby, I'd definitely buy one.
Breast feeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertising, of course, is a little crazy, but that's how it feels.
A genius product," wrote one user.
And another comment: "Cool advertising for moms who breastfeed (often they do it directly in their workplaces or in toilets) and who actually feel a little bit like cows.
This ad is not to praise or insult our dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all danced with these invisible milk suckers hidden under their bras.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie's milk sucker is completely inexpensive, has no wires or tubes, is freely placed in a breast-feeding bra, and is invisible, allowing women to move, keep babies, and even go outside during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood expert of Mother, commented: “Elvie's milk pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
Drawing a parallel between women and milk cows, we wanted to focus on breastfeeding and all its problems, showing in a funny and fun way the incredible sense of freedom that the new milk sucker gives us.
This isn't the first time Elvie's milk sucker gets in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium of the designer Martha Yakubowski using this product for its purpose.
Hundreds of migrant children moved freely to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children had increased dramatically, although the number of monthly crossings had remained relatively constant, partly because the strict rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration had made it difficult for children to be placed in the caretakers.
The majority of sponsors are usually the same undocumented immigrants themselves and are afraid to jeopardize their stay in the country by sponsoring a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsor and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that the data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-ranking immigration and customs officer, testified at Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked for bail for minors without care.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been tried before.
“Around 80 per cent of persons who are either bailors or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are foreign offenders.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these individuals,” Albens said.
According to the shelter workers, in an effort to speed up the process of child registration, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to be tried within a month of detention, rather than 60 days, as they had previously been.
In order to declare their legal status to the immigration judge, many are present via video link rather than in person.
Those considered not eligible for assistance would be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and information that has emerged in the system in recent months, the longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which could lead to outbreaks of violence or escape.
Lawyers say that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs that the child is having difficulties are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to tent camps without giving them time to prepare for it emotionally or to say good - bye to their friends may exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders the US, France and Turkey's “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mu'alem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country had been at war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “will be considered accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally,” he said to the assembly.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been driven out of their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over.”
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Al-Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Mu'alem said that good conditions had been created for their return, and he accused “some Western countries” of “proliferating irrational fears” that had encouraged refugees to remain outside the country.
“We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of civilians”, he says.
“They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union caution that Syria will not be assisted in its reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN Diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major siege of Idlib rebels created an opportunity for political negotiations to continue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province of three million people.
However, Mu'alem stressed that the agreement had a “specific time frame” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including Al-Qaida-related elements of the Nusr Front, who would be “destroyed”.
UN Envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee, composed of representatives of the Government and the opposition, will be convened shortly to elaborate a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee, stating that the work of the commission should be limited to “considering the articles of the current constitution” and cautioned against interference.
Why Trump wins a second term
In keeping with that logic, Mr. Trump would win his re-election in 2020 if impeachment and scandal did not prematurely complete his presidency, which was likely to be the hope of many liberal audiences.
And this will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency in history!”
At the moment, there's no sign of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers of prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Madow Show" has surpassed cable ratings, gathering 3.5 million viewers at night during the main news show.
“It's a fire that people are reaching for because it's beyond our grasp,” says Neil Bare, director of the ABC drama, “Designed Survivor”, about a cabinet minister who becomes president after the Capitol has been destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Skovell, a long-public comedy writer and author of "Only Funny: Some Disgusting Truths About Infiltration of the Hollywood Boys' Club", offers another theory.
She remembers driving a taxi to Boston once before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Yes, because he's funny!" she says.
In all this chaos, there's something valuable -- it's fun.
Of course, unlike all other content broadcast on television, Washington storylines can determine the future of Row versus Wade and answer questions about the possibility of reuniting immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
Disconnection is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you've been watching a group of experts for six hours in a row discussing Bob Woodward's use of the “deep background” for his book, or Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin jacket (a dress warmed with pride), as The Washington Post writes, or the dramatic description of Stormy Daniels, say, Mr. Trump's anatomy, is beyond the ordinary knowledge.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario with the same eyes.
“Perfectly, his job is to make us feel that the reality show is that he feeds you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Weelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawn Stars about the changing acting composition of the Trump show and the daily twists of the story (the N.F.L. fight, commendation by Kim Jong Eun).

When I contacted Mr. Fleis this week, there were 27 degrees of heat on the north bank of Kauai, sunlight, but he hid inside his house and watched MSNBC during CNN recording.
He couldn't get off the screen, at least not exactly when they show how Brett Cavanaugh appeared before the Senate's Legal Committee and decided on the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows, people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’ says Mr. Fleis.
"Then I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outsider money is infiltrated in the worst intermediate elections held by the White House.
Not surprisingly, the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives a cash flow because of the change in districts in Congress where two officials compete for the same place.
This suburb of Pittsburgh, whose geography was recently changed, supports a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb is opposed to another active official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly intersecting with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that, as a result of election frauds, the old districts had been attributed to the Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a heated debate on the financing of campaigns between the financial forces of the main party, the Congressional Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NCDC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after winning a small difference in the March special congressional elections in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.

The US punished El Salvador for supporting China, but then retreated
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which had led to Washington's negative reaction.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama, who also owned Panama until his partners evicted the Trump management team.
Representatives of the State Department decided to withdraw the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan”, which was announced earlier this month by the press secretary of the Department of Heather Nauert.
However, only El Salvador, which received about $140 million of American aid in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support, was being considered for punishment.
The proposed penalties, including a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for that country of Central America, with its high unemployment and murder rates.
Against the background of regular internal meetings, the representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to take stock of a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward and had effectively stopped considering the issue of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October and will be addressed by Vice-President Mike Pence as an indication that the Administration really attaches importance to this meeting.
Three American diplomatic representatives returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House representative, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three United States officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are corroborated by an external analyst who is in line with the administration, but who also spoke anonymously.
Learn History
The next step could be a report by Special Adviser Robert Müller on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's justice, which was now very substantial in public reports.
Mr. Muller has also reportedly begun to investigate the existence of a collusion between Trump and Russia and its attacks during the past elections.
If Congress replaces the host, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in this body, just as he prepares to speak again to the voters, and perhaps eventually to the jury of his colleagues.
But there are many “ifs”; I do not mean that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, nor is his equivalent in Europe.
We will all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, and that would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we have not done so and have missed the opportunity to avoid further years of bloodshed.
The course of history is taking place at such points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
The Americans are experiencing some of these turning points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Müller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to this newspaper, last year he offered to make secret records of the President's activities and reasoned that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein argues that The Times data are incorrect.
“How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Cavanaugh is not complete or true, or if he is finally confirmed as a supreme judge despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
Above all, will we vote in the medium term for the Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these trials with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to go through them with dignity because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish, exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime whose officials once occupied a Polish house where I lived years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she led me to light Saturday candles on a table with a symbol of swastika.

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic in anticipation of a clash with the football club of the Vienna Rapid.
The Rangers accept the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that winning the Austrians after an impressive tie in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month will enable them to take a strong position in the League of Europe Group G.
The knee injury prevented the semi-defendant Graham Dorrans from performing for the first time in the season, with a score of 2:2 against Villarreal, but he believed that Rangers could use the result as a springboard to achieve great results.
"This was a good moment for us because "Villarreal" is a good team," said a 31-year-old football player.
"We entered the game, thinking we could get something, but we left with no one.
In the end, we may have been able to cope, but in general, it was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success was at the second half, where we were better.
This Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's gonna be a hard game, because they've shown good results in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, considering everything about my injuries and the replacements at the club itself, but now there's a good factor in this place.
The composition is well chosen, and the boys are really enjoying it; they've been trained for "ura."
I hope we can move forward, leave behind last season and succeed.”
Women are falling asleep for fear of their pension savings.
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people involved in the national study said that they had discussed with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
However, only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
“People want to be taken care of by a family member, but they don't try to talk to them about it,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance.
And that's where we start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and your family where and how you will receive medical care, as this may be an important cost factor.
Consult with your financial consultant to help you draw up a plan for the payment of these expenses.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term insurance policy or a mixed life insurance policy that will help to cover these costs or to insure itself with your own property, provided that you have money.
Get your legal documents in order to get rid of the legal battles.
Make sure that you have a medical authority and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that specialists do what you want if you cannot communicate.
We also recommend that consideration be given to the possibility of establishing a financial power of attorney.
A trusted person should be selected to help you make financial decisions and to monitor the payment of your bills if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the small things: Imagine that your elderly parent needed urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to provide information on his medications and on what he is allergic to?
Write down all these details on paper to be properly prepared in case.
Martin adds: “It is not only the availability of finance, but also the choice of doctors.”
"What kind of medication do you take?
Who's gonna take care of your dog?
Make and write down this plan.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people died as a result of the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
Due to the breakdown of communications, rescue workers are unable to obtain any information from Donggal, an area north of Pala, which is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5-point earthquake.
In Palau, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of a natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palau and Donggal on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 (data for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami erupted.
Donggala is a district stretching along 300 km (180 miles) of the coastline on the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, a county smaller than the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are at the heart of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi and, in particular, of the coastal region of Donggal.
Nickel mining is also important for the economy of the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morvali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, in the past 100 years, the tsunami has destroyed Palau and Donghal on several occasions.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggal.
The tsunami also occurred in western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on a Pacific volcanic fire ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A sequence of severe earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 struck south of Java, Indonesia ' s most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 occurred in Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 occurred on one of the Mentawai Islands at Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck Pidi Jaya district in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake of 2004 and the tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but over 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes struck the tourist island of Lombok of Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists temporarily remained in ruins.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is under arrest for domestic violence.
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-president of Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Palin of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, intervened in the situation of domestic violence and for resisting arrest, according to a report published by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a friend of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in Mat-Su and will be released on bail at $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his “contested innocence”.
Palin faces three class A minor crimes, which means that he may be imprisoned for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B crime punishable by up to one day ' s imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges were brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police, reporting the alleged assault.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining her son’s cruel behaviour with post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people died in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims will increase in the coming days.

The Federal Prosecutor's Office wants to impose a rare death sentence on a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Syfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that resulted in the death of eight people — a rare punishment for a federal crime that has not been used in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, aged 30, allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to attack a bicycle track on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saïp “intentionally” killed eight people and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to achieve the death penalty filed in the South District of New York.
According to the judicial document, both charges may be subject to the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Grand Federal Jury read Saipov a conviction with 22 counts of murder involving eight racketeering charges, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and car destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack was “deliberately planned and premeditated”, Saipov carried out it as described “in an abhorrent, violent and criminal manner”.
“Sifullo Habibullahevich Saïpov injured, damaged and lost the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Laure Decadadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pugnukko”, states the notification of intent.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the prosecutor in the Southern District of New York demanded the death penalty for a criminal offence.
In September 2009, the accused Khalid Barnes was convicted for the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The death penalty in a federal case in New York was last imposed in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Rosenbergi was executed using an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the Saipov judicial documents, an Uzbek national showed no remorse after his attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired by an ISIS video on his phone.
He also asked for the flag of ISIL to be displayed in his hospital room, and reported to the police.
He denies his guilt on all 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s federal public defenders, said that they were “expressly disappointed” by the decision of the prosecutor’s office.
“We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty, rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only increase the pain of these events for all those involved,” said Patton.
The defence of Saipov had previously requested prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Member of Parliament of Tori says that NYJEL FARAGE should not be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Today, during a protest at the Tori conference, Nigel Faraj vowed to “mobilize the people's army”.
Former Ukip leader said that politicians should feel the euro skeptics, as one of the members of Parliament, Teresa May, suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, said at a meeting in Birmingham that the UK would have "upgraded" if Mr. Farage were Secretary of Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Ms. May in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks was compounded by the fact that members of the Tori party opposed to EU withdrawal were joining in a separate protest against Brexit, which was taking place in the city.
The premier is struggling to maintain his compromise plan, as expressed in Checkers in the midst of attacks by Brexit’s supporters, its opponents and the EU.
The allies insist that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels despite a negative reaction, and thus force Euroskeptics and Labourists to choose between her package and the chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solikhalla that he wanted to play Checkers.
He suggested that Mr. Faraj be levelled and held accountable for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible, we would have gone out,” he said.
Deputy Wellingborough added: “I will continue to stand for Brexit, but we need to beat Checkers.”
In his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British had changed their minds and wanted to stay was completely untrue.”
Brexit's fan of Tori Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, commenting to journalists: “I say Prime Minister, just listen to people.”
“Checkers is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, he is also not popular among our party members and our activists, who actually storm the streets and choose us first.
Please put back the Checkers and start listening to what you're told.”
In her strong address to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Ministers remain in their jobs if they remain true to their promises.”
Mr. Faraj said that if politicians were to betray the 2016 referendum decision, they should be made to feel “facilitated”.
“It is now a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class,” he says.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We won't let you get away with this."
Turning to the thrilled crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the brink of Brexit's betrayal, to feel bad.
“We will mobilize the people's army of this country, which has given us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we are independent, independent and proud of the United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Brexit's opponents took a demonstration on Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved "Tori vs. Brexit" posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, criticized conservatives because of security problems in their party's mobile attachment.
“And these people claim to be able to set up the IT systems and technologies of Canada, to work at borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"It's one complete farce.
There is no good Brexit in principle,” he claims.
Warren's planning to “study” the possibilities of participating in the presidential race.
Senator Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. Member of Parliament, says that after the November elections, she will “studyly explore the possibility of running for presidents.”
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a council meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Deel, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There are rumors that she has a chance to take over as Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon in Holioca, she held another meeting with voters; since Trump took office, it has been her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and to do that, there's a woman upstairs."
As a result of Simms' murder, an LSU player was arrested.
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the LSU basketball player, Wade Simms, had been arrested on Friday.
At 11:00 p.m., at a press conference, Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department released a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify the person who was able to videotape.
A 20-year-old Simms was shot at South University campus on Friday morning.
“Wade Simms was shot in the head, resulting in his death,” said Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul to the journalists on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend, and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being involved in the incident, carrying a gun, and shot Wade Simms.
Simpson did not resist his arrest and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 games last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the title of world champion after command tactics gave him victory over Sebastian Fettel.
From the moment that Walteri Bottas passed his qualification on Saturday, overstepping Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes' command tactics would play a major role in the race.
Already with the Pole Position Bottas, he started well and practically hangs on Hamilton when he defended his position at the first two corners, and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel was the first to go to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton swirling in the tail of the entire group – a choice that became decisive.
Mercedes went to a pit stop one lap later, and then went behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some wheel-to-wheel struggle, jumped forward, causing Ferrari’s driver reluctantly to leave the inner space free, risking getting caught after a double movement to protect in the third corner.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstoppen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place by the end of the first round.
He then ran most of the race, holding on to his own tires, with the aim of quickly finishing, moving Kimi Rykkonen to fourth place.
In the end, he went to the pit stop on the 44th round, but he couldn't increase the pace in the remaining eight circles, because Rykkonen was ranked fourth.
It's been a tough day, because Valttery did fantastic work this weekend and showed real honor by sharing it with me.
The team did such an extraordinary job to have a few tricks in store," said Hamilton.
Traitorial sign language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting with voters on Saturday for claiming that she had not released a letter from Christine Blacie Ford, accusing Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the position of supreme judge, of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford's testimony to the Senate's Legal Committee, saying that what happened in the Senate showed that the participants in those events were “smug, vile, and lying people.”
“The only possible reaction to all of this, and what happens in the last few days in the Senate, is beautiful, it's anger, anger, disgustingness and lies,” he said.
"You see all these leaks, and then they say, "No, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you "send" information?
Do you remember her answer... did you "leave" the information of the document? - "What, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.
Okay, stop.
Did we "silent"?... No, we didn't "silent," he added with the senator's tone.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh, and in early September it was illegally released, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred in her office.
“I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, but I didn't leak her information,” Feinstein said to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked."
However, the manner in which she denied the leak charges seemed to displease the president, who commented on it during the Saturday rally: “I'll tell you what, the body language really failed her.
She may not have been "silent," but the body language was the worst I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend his candidate for the position of supreme judge, who had been accused by three women of sexual harassment, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are certainly trying to regain power in all possible ways.
We see abhorrentness, abhorrentness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to gain power and control,” quotes Mediaite.
British elite hockey league: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Jayants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals, for the Giants in the game against Dundee.
In the Elite Hockey League game, Dundee Stars paid for their defeat against Belfast Jayants on Friday, winning a return match with a score of 5-3 in favour of Dundee.
Jayants gained an early two-goal advantage thanks to the hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney raised the level of the home team before Dwyer led the Jayants.
François Bouchard compared the Dundee score before the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen consolidated their victory.
For the people of Adam Keef who won the Dundee at 2:1 in Belfast on Friday night, this was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
It was the fourth meeting between the parties in the season, when the Jayants won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's first goal was at 3:35 p.m. after Kendall McFall's ball pass with David Rutherford's support, after which Bovilier doubled the advantage four minutes later.
During the start-up period, Sullivan returned the owners to the game at 1:10 p.m. before Matt Markwardt helped Coney balance the account at 15:16 p.m.
Dwyer made sure that the Jayants intercepted the initiative during the first break when he scored the second goal at the end of the first period.
The owners were regrouped, and Bouchard rebalanced the score, scored the goal at 27.37 p.m.
Coney and Charles Corcoran joined together to help Nielsen give "Dundey" the opportunity to gain leadership for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, after which he and his team secured the victory by holding the rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Jayants, who have so far lost four of the last five matches, are headed to Milton Keynes for the next match, which will take place on Friday.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on board could escape the earthquake.
The Indonesian air traffic controller was given posthumously the title of hero after knowingly dying to enable a plane with hundreds of passengers to fly safely.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared as a result of the severe earthquake on Sulawesi on Friday, which caused the tsunami.
Strong underground shocks continue to destroy the area, and many residents of the city of Palu are trapped under the rubble of buildings.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the horrendous tower at Muthiara Sis Al Jufre airport, Palu city.
He remained in his seat to make sure that the Batik Air Light 6321 aircraft, which was then on the airstrip, was able to fly safely.
Then when he thought the tower was falling, he jumped off it.
He later died in the hospital.
An Indonesian aeronautical representative, Johannes Sirait, stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter boarded Pala.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths from the earthquake may reach thousands, as the disaster management agency reports that access to the towns of Donggal, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is likely to increase, as a large number of people are still under debris and many have never been able to get out of it,” says a representative of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters have devastated the city of Pala, where a mass burial of the dead will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, says Sky News: “Emergency supplies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The mini-markets have been looted everywhere.”
Jan Helmand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, says CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is already in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're gonna catch there.
The tragedy has already taken on a rather serious scale, but it can be much worse.”
President Joko Vidodo of Indonesia arrived in Palau on Sunday and addressed the armed forces of the country, inter alia, saying: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? ” CNN explains.
Early this year, Indonesia suffered from an earthquake in Lomboca that killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that one person has disappeared after a plane crash in the lagoon.
The airline that carried out the flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagune in Micronesia now reports that one person is missing, while it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew left the sinking aircraft safely.
The Air Niugini report states that on Saturday afternoon, she has no information about one male passenger.
The airline stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and the police to try to find the man.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue other passengers and the crew after they fell on the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers had been hospitalized on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
The causes of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the plane landed in a lagoon near the airstrip.
Some witnesses claim that the aircraft was unable to land on the airstrip.
American passenger Bill Janes says the plane started to enter the runway too low.
“And it's very good,” Janes adds.
Janes told us that he and other passengers were able to get to the emergency exits on a sinking plane because the water level was up to the belt.
He also said that the stewardess panicked and yelled on board and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that seafarers who repaired the dock nearby also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat that brought people to shore before the plane was loaded to about 30 meters (100 feet).
Air Safety Network data show that 111 people have died in aircraft crashes involving companies registered with PNG in the past two decades, but none of these accidents were related to Air Niugini.
The intelligence analyst was able to prove that the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution instituted proceedings against a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
A U.S. Department of Justice analyst, Paul Rawlett, gave hours of testimony as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the department how he used his cell phone records to provide an overview of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Roulette told me that he had received data on the whereabouts of these people from several mobile phones; according to these data, Tellis spent time with Chambers that night, which contradicts his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the information received, his cell phone was close to Chambers; when it became apparent, the police interrogated Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford claimed that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that “it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, the phone records indicated that they had only been called within one week.
Rollett also showed that some time after Chambers Tellis died, she had removed her text messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," says Hale.
The defence must begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is "conscious hip-hop"?
The hip-hopper trio is going to fight the negative attitude towards this genre, filling its music with positive content.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that the hip-hop content changed from the original political and social problems.
The group wants to go back to its roots and make the "conscious" hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugues and the Common recently witnessed a renaissance in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
The New York nanny sued the couple for a racist text.
The New York nanny sued the couple for discriminating dismissal after receiving a report from a woman complaining that the nanny was “another black” that the woman mistakenly sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
Spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that the claim is “for the purpose of extortion”.
Lindsay Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern that the new nanny offered by the childcare service, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to her family on her first working day in 2016.
“Neo her, it's not another black one,” Mrs. Plasco-Flexman texted her husband.
However, instead of texting her husband, she sent it twice wrongly to Ms. Maurice.
Aware of her mistake, the “small-infected” Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, claiming in the service that the nanny, who turned out to be an African-American, was not doing her job well, and in general that they were expecting a Filipino, not an African-American girl, reports New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day of work, and then sent home to Uber.
Maurice now sues a couple and claims compensation for dismissal of $350 a day for six months, according to the terms of the original oral agreement, which, however, were not established by any contract.
“I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable,” she said “Post” on Friday, adding, “And I know that this is discrimination.”
The spouses disagree with the charge of racism and argue that the dismissal of Maurice can be considered a reasonable step, since by insulting her they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her in a message something she really didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joe Plasco, the Post.
“But would you trust your children with someone you were rude to, even if you were rude, not wanting to?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Oh, come on!"
Calling the claim “forgery”, Plasco said that his wife had only given birth two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“And are you prepared to pursue a man in this situation?
Not very nice of you," added a banker specializing in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already handed down its sentence on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behaviour and illogical issues.
Paddington’s publishers feared the readers would not understand the move with the talking bear, says a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, said of the letter: “It is hard to put yourself in the position of the first reader before it was published.
It's very funny to know that Paddington has a huge success.”
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a children's book about a bear, had worked as an operator for BBC and would have been optimistic about the rejection of the publication and had added that the 60-year anniversary of the publication of his books was “and happy and bitter” since their author was gone last year.
As for Paddington’s bear itself, she refers to him as “a very important member of our family” and that her father was quietly proud that his character eventually became famous.
“He was a quiet and humble man,” his daughter says.
“Paddington was so real to him, and for his father, it was almost as if his own child had succeeded: he was proud of him, though he did not really consider that success to be his own merit.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear itself.”
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was taken to the Hospital of Nice Hospital, Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“Nood called regularly and said that it was really bad that something went wrong,” says Mrs. Ednan-Laperuza.
“Then he called again and said that she would die in the next two minutes, and that we should say goodbye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors gave her, forcing her heart to work, gradually stopped working, leaving her body.
She died earlier than expected.
I should have just sat there and waited, knowing it was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself together.”
After all, Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa, mourning her daughter's loss, boarded the plane with other passengers, humbled herself with the enormous loss she had just experienced.
“No one around knew what had happened,” she says.
“My head went down, and I kept crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
He so needed my love and support.
I know how much he loved her."
Women who survive the loss of loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide try to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey are posting postcards on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he started to get depressed, and at the age of 18, he killed himself.
“I don't want other parents to feel the same way I feel every day,” she says.
45-year-old Davis, living in Leedney, says her son was a great cook and had a hell of a pretty smile.
“Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, the room seemed to light a light.”
However, before he died, he left his job because he was going through a really scary time.”
This happened in 2014, and Tyler was found dead by his brother, who was 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, "I never cease to be afraid of a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis invented these cards “to make people know that there is someone to talk to and talk to, even if it's your friend.
You can't sit there and keep quiet, you have to talk to people.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, has lost Mark, her husband, who has lived with him for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn't say he felt depressed, upset or anything,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas, he became particularly ill: he did not even look at the children when they opened their presents.”
She says his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to go through it, and this event has shocked our family.
It ripped her apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Cavanaugh's future is on the line: the FBI is starting an investigation.
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for — an investigation limited in time and volume, we could bring a little unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would “break” against the background of a growing party chain reaction.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigating?
Time is the cause of their hesitation.
Intermediate elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November, and if — as expected — things are going to go badly for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to obtain the man they want and to elect him as the supreme judge of the country.
George W. Bush is calling the senators to lobby for Mr. Cavanaugh's support, who has since worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has released its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It was still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh could obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the issue of equality of votes and confirm his candidacy for the position of supreme judge.
The number of defectors from North Korea decreased under Kim
Since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has declined, said the South Korean legislator.
Park Byung Seug, referring to the data from the Ministry of the South, stated that compared to 2,706 escapes recorded in 2011, the figure had fallen to 1,127 last year.
Mr. Park said that the key factors had been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates imposed by smugglers.
Pyongyang doesn't make any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953 more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people run across China, with the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a secure demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
North-South relations, which are still in a state of war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume the deadlocked negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This occurred after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, at which they reached general agreements on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yoon Ho accused the US of obstructing progress on the issue by sanctions.
“If we do not have the slightest confidence in the US, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will in no way be able to begin disarmament unilaterally”, said Mr. Ri in his statement to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical," and claims he's not qualified to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the position of supreme judge, “hysterical” and said that he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court because of her temper.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at a Texas Tribune Festival event in Austin, Texas.
“I can't help but think that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave like this, she would have been called a "stress," says Pelosi about her reaction to Cavanaugh's statement to the Senate Law Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh was emotionally rejecting Dr. Christine Blacie Ford's allegations of sexual harassment, which allegedly occurred when they were both teenagers.
Cavanaugh spoke emotionally enough, sometimes even suffocated and suffocated about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the committee’s Democrats, calling the charges against him “a grave and well-planned assassination of the actor”, organized by the liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Cavanaugh had merely confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think he will disqualify himself with his claims, as well as the way he attacks the Clintons and the Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi resented when asked if she would try to bring Cavanaugh to justice if his guilt was confirmed and if the Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I'll say that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the trial he's in,” said Pelosi.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions regarding the Affordable Health Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearing on his candidacy, Cavanaugh avoided the question whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time to let a hysterical and biased person take up the position of supreme judge, but to say, ‘How wonderful!’”, says Pelosi.
And women have to own it.
It's righteous anger, months and years of anger, she can't go through it without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don't think it's as unusual as you think.”
She went on to say, "I was very helpful to a woman who worked in a management position somewhere, and she told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that she used to explain to her interlocutor, "You may think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm really angry."
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed with this approach.”
Tears are allowed as an exit to anger, partly because they are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in an office dominated by men: one day I cried out of furious anger, but I was grabbed by an elderly woman, a soulless manager, who I was always afraid of, and dragged into a stairwell.
“Never let them see you crying,” she said to me.
“They don't know you're crying out of anger.
They think you're upset, and they're happy to think that you've finally got mad at you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some minor affair and left the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to prevent her from running for the presidency.
“This decision was not well thought out,” she admitted to me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the case Snow White and Seven Dwarves.
The campaign had already come to an end, and it had lagged behind in fund-raising, so she swore that she would not participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It seemed like a completely lost option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave 1,000 dollars each to men, offered her only 250.
“What am I, a priced commodity to them, or what?”, she wondered.
When she gave a speech declaring that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was so emotionally engrossed — thanks to the people who supported her, frustration with a system that made it so difficult to collect money and access voters, and anger over gender-based discrimination that she suffocated.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
"You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I still wondered what they would write on my monument.
"She cried forever"?
How a trade war with America can benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first spikes of the US-China trade war were stunning, and while the battle is far from over, the division between countries can benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel, and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, when new tariffs affected products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has been retaliating each time, recently imposing duties on United States goods at a cost of $60 billion, ranging from five to ten per cent.
China promised that the response to the US would be equal every time, and the world’s second largest economy is unlikely to start to experience at least the slightest difficulties in the near future.
Making Washington retreat means giving in to demands, but publicly giving in to the US would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing can play its cards correctly, the US trade war pressure can provide long-term support to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to economic corking in any of these countries is, in fact, far more dangerous than previously acknowledged by observers,” says Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security, which specializes in Asia.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “prepared” for the return of refugees
Syria stated that it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and was seeking assistance in rebuilding a country devastated by a war that had lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem reported that conditions were improving.
“The situation on the ground today has become more stable and secure because of the success of the fight against terrorism”, he said.
The Government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live in peace there.
At present, all conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they have had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for helping to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance on any terms or from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe holds the victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Rider Cup 2018, winning the United States team with a total of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The US has already lost six consecutive times on European soil, and the European Ryder Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe regained the crown thanks to the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn, who scored the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Miquelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, struck his first long-distance strike into the water on the 16th hole of steam 3, giving way to his match, Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds, becoming the 1-4 players who ever went 5-0-0, as the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit lost 5:4 players with the lowest ratings in the European team, Turbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
One of the world's best players, Dustin Johnson, gave up 2:1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have been in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, was the winner of the tournament in Europe's history with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don't usually cry, but I can't help today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the cup again.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help,” says emotional Garcia after a European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who won the American golf legend by Tiger Woods on Sunday with a score of 2:1 in a single game.
“I have great pride in this victory — I grew up watching Tiger Woods play,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These scores are rather strange for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles, giving only to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team fought throughout the weekend, trying to succeed in vain, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finaw, who showed the highest-class golf course throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furic of the United States said after his team's discomfort, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we managed to beat Europe a little bit.
It didn't work.
We're taking off our hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played excellent.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're going to move forward to succeed.
I love all 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to be able to lose.
We've lost."
Red tide: The micro-organism concentration has decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota.
The latest report of the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife reflects the overall decline in the concentration of red tides in some parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC, in the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier, there are reports of large blooms, indicating a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red Tide extends approximately 130 miles of the coastline from the northern Pinell to the southern districts of Lee.
The cavities can be observed about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but the number has fallen significantly since last week.
The red tide is also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, average concentrations were reported in and around the Pinellas district, from low to high concentrations in the Hillsborough coastal zone, high concentrations in Manati and Sarasota and coastal areas, average concentrations in Charlotte County, high concentrations on the Li District coast, and low concentrations in Collier District.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier there is still a risk of respiratory irritation.
In Northwest Florida, this probability was not reported last week.
