Hey, I'm sick, so it's better to move on to the next weekend, I'm sorry.
I know how to cook, but I like to bake.
In Ukraine, borsche, cookers, and others are traditional.
I don’t have any favorite foods, and I like to try a variety of foods from different countries.
What kind of food do you like?
I want to be busy.
There's a train, and there's no place.

Green: Mariupol — The Heart of War, Stop Fighting — We Will Have Weak Positions
President Volodymyr Zelenski believes that fighting for the east of Ukraine, and in particular for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war – and if the U.S.S.S.S. is defeated there, the Russians may give up negotiations and reoccupy the de-occupied areas.
The direct language is, "Mariopole is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It fights, we fight, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the city’s protectors, ed.) are people who have drawn a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (area) of the EPA, and if they are stronger, the table of victory will be closer to us and we will have the advantage of a dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these ways, we may not wait to meet.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to the cities we've been depriving us of.
They can go for that too.
Then our battle situation will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting for the Russian side.
Sadly, we do.
"We believe in our outcome, our victory..."
Details: Greensky also said that going to talks after the torture of the Ukrainians is difficult, but "we must not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have them."
The direct language is, "People will accept peace in any case because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something – and I don't think any peace will satisfy them on any condition.
But if we speak not emotionally, the war must end in peace, or millions of victims.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight — but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing, there's no people."
Good day, do you have any more space for a Czech course for adults from 7:00 a.m. on Tuesday?

The food needs a code
The Department of Defence of Ukraine’s main intelligence agency published a list of Russian military officials who had been involved in military crimes in the city of Bucha of Kyiv.
According to Ucrynform, this is reported by the Department of Defense of Ukraine in Facebook.
“Every Ukrainian must know their names!
The MoU of Ukraine has obtained a list of military officers from 64 separate motorcycle squads who are directly involved in military crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Butch,” is reported.
In the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is stated that for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and held accountable.
You can view the list by reference.
According to Ucrynform, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel, and the entire region of Kyiv were freed from Russian invaders.
In the liberated cities and villages, mass killings by Russian military civilians have been recorded.
On April 1, the city head of Butchi, Anatoly Fedorook, reported that 280 people had been buried in mass graves.
Irina Venediktwa, the Attorney General, stated that 410 bodies of killed civilians had been removed from the Russian invaders in the Kiev region on April 3.
On February 24, Russia’s president, Volodymyr Putin, announced the beginning of a full - scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian invaders are firing and destroying key infrastructure objects, firing massive rounds of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, jet systems of fire, ballistic missiles, aerial bombs.
Good afternoon, I'm sorry, but I can't work for you because I'll be flying to Canada in the near future.

I was looking at the forecast.
I don't need brandy.
Just nice clothes at normal prices and size.

I thought after a week, but the situation is getting hot.
Tomorrow might be a bad connection on the road.
I thank everyone for their experience, even if they are painful.
I think I've learned from every situation for myself to avoid repeating mistakes in the future.
The directives are given in the form of numbered written supplements, which are part of the Rules.
I'm sure it won't be a problem.
In Ukraine, many people celebrate this week in the same way.
It depends on religion.
Whether a man is a Greek Catholic or a Catholic.
At the beginning, you can try it free of charge.
Maybe you can write us an algorym to pay for it, and we can pay for it.
We have that paper that kids get at the end of the school year, it's a table, and they get a witness when they're born and married.

We promised you we'd surprise you when you went to school.
Bull is great, I've got money for two months of rent, in Olomouca the neighborhood doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of civilians north of Kiev.
Photographs of people who had been shot and killed have confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people question each other, how could that have happened in the 21st century?
And I'm not surprised at all, and it's exactly what I was waiting for.
I took out children and elderly parents from Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girl coworkers with the kids, and then he went back to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I've consistently helped the U.S.S.A., and I have no doubt that, in the case of the occupation, my family will not be spared.
Because he was, and I remain absolutely confident, that the essence of the rotting communist-CDB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist; it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in Gitomir prison.
A few years ago, in the Jewish U.S.S.S.U., a copy of the great-grandfather’s shooting case was released: the whole case was over a hundred pages long, and the sentence of execution was very simple and even scarier.
The accused was unwritten, denied the guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was a free man, a poor one-door high, never went to fortresses.
The fact that they lived on the huts and had several cows was sufficient to condemn the shepherd and nurse of young children to execution.
The family did not even know the place of burial.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people had been taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
There's the name of the scissor.
Our former Speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics, and I won't be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGB informer.
The apple from the apple is not far from falling, as we know...
The shooter who had ordered the execution of the villagers was ethnic Russians.
Analysing the case of the great-grandfather, he was interested in various information resources.
There's great information resources in Russia (without sarcasm) like "The Infinite Baracke" that remind us of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NCVD have found ways to punish and kill almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70 to 80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves of the victims of Stalin’s repression and publicly wrote the names of the murderers — the system first discredited and then destroyed them.
It's like they found child pornography files on the computer, put them in jail, and they died there quickly.
The KGB is killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the past century.
So why are you suddenly surprised at their actions now?!
There is a concentration of the most repugnant qualities of human nature.
On top of a thousand-year Ordinary tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism began in the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then a wild genetic experiment was done on what came out, cutting out intelligence during several waves of red terror.
Look at the 1992 half-French film Checkist, and that's what happened.
Zo, you've seen my photos in my bathing suit.
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from the cough?
I'm sorry, I don't have anyone to ask.
I was wondering if you know where the kids went because Galia couldn't know them.
Lubosh, Igor asks if you are comfortable driving tomorrow? (He is free and can go because the car has not been seen at the station today.)
It's very uncomfortable for us to bother you so much.
You're very helpful, thank you!

When girls return from school, what do they do?
We've come to the place where we've been put from the center in the garden, the conditions are good.
But there's a big one, but there's a man here who drinks alcohol and smokes in the room, loud music is the least that's "consoled," the smell of cigarettes by drunken men, and me and the kids... it's scary to sleep, to be honest.
Please help with the accommodation, please.
But where it's safe and it's not smoked.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is like this, and they smoke right here.
I beg you very much, one of them is barely standing on their feet, something is yelling, something he doesn't like.

We talked about children with special needs. You and their education system in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shahova introduced me as a Fpoint worker, the first question was how the dog was found, how the mop was found.
Everyone's following the Facebook page.
They asked me to give you a greeting and say that it's very interesting for them to read the news.
They also talked about people of Roman nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if the child comes and the parents don't understand Czech at all, then after work, I can help them with the phone.

It's important that love is real and mutual.
I don't know how it is in Europe, but in our country, people enter into marriage for various reasons, mostly useful, mercantile goals.
And I have a problem with that if I don't love someone doesn't work.
Yeah, we took our aunts home right away.
She was very grateful, and she was crying.
I told her about you and how you helped the Ukrainians.
She had tears in her eyes.
I told you if it was possible, there might still be some old blanket and pillow.
But that's not necessarily, only if it is.
I felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I had a lot of questions about God, why my life has been affected by situations that have caused me to dislike everything.
I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made meetings.
That's right, but we don't even know where it is. We've been looking for an hour today and we've been walking back. The two blankets aren't suitable, so two and we need a big size.
Even now, I've been thinking about you, and you wrote to me.
Does your father know how to speak Russian or any other family member?
You can have the kids come to Wally and play in the choir.
All right, let's take a chance.
I'm glad I met you, too.
The house was talking to Volodymyr to advise me whether or not I should go while they find or look for the lady who lives with us. That we have to go to the metro station of the museum there is an institution that helps us find a place to live.
For the little one, I'm going to cross the barrier.
Some of their questions I didn't know the answer
So it would be good for Thursday, if possible.
I can't call the doctor because I haven't done a food license exam yet.
But I can't call him because I ran out of money.
I can't fill out the phone because I don't understand the Czech online banking and the Ukrainian bank card doesn't go up.
In addition to the waterphone, I can't change the rate so that I have normal calls and the Internet doesn't fill the number.
I'm losing my mind.
Where's Price not cheeky, but face... the headline doesn't sound right, what do you mean?
I'm ashamed to be unemployed.
I just wrote that at school,

The first new Hawaiians can be delivered 30 months after signing the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed by 2027.

If it were warm, it would be very good.
I made an online application, and I'll try to get off today after work.
We're good. With the heat, we're good. We're good at it. We've got the experience in Ukraine. We've got gas, but since it's very expensive, we've been drowning the stove with wood.

To me, marriage is the secret of two people who do not talk to one another with their family or friends.
A man and a woman decide matters themselves in their family, especially without family involvement.
Can we be together?
It'll take a while before we're around.
Why not try this way for now?
I rented a car for nine people, we'll come with Mariana and your family.

Thank you very much for helping people.
We're in Slape right now, we're being sheltered by friends for a while.
My family is a man, a daughter, six years old, a son, 11 years old.
The man has already found a driver’s job.
I'm a massageist, a rehabist looking for a job.
For the children to attend school and for me to work, we need housing near civilization.
I just had to give it to the country today!
I didn't know even the big shops would be closed.
I'm making the bluebirds like this: in a pot of tomato paste, I'm making 0.5 liters of water, 3-4 canteens of tomato paste, so it's going to boil.
I put the doves in a pot and pour that sauce.
I've been in the oven for about 1.5 hours.
How much money do I have on this room?
I've got to bring it all in.
Monday, 4:00.
4. In 2022, refugees from the war in Ukraine may request humanitarian assistance at the new workplace of the Labour Administration in the Prasa Market.
The branch office in Room 29 is dedicated to providing and processing requests for help, so there is a translator in the area.
Lydia's been brought to school, but because of the illness, we're going to go to school on Tuesday, I told you today.
I'm sitting there, holding headphones on my ears, listening to music, and thinking about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, love, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I think we're together, that we're a couple.
I'd say there'll be a lot of work after the war.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I know a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what's going to happen to the house.
I need to get a food license test, can I do that in you?
Please give me five guests tomorrow to prepare the apartment.
Is this the fifth place I understand in the TV room?
Plan and fix the couch?
Can we stay at your place while Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to live?
Don't worry about it.
Not the new one that's already benefited, but it's working, but it's not necessary.
Write the address in Czech, let's see the map where it's from us.
I don't know how much space there is so I can't plan with the furniture want this week to finally look at that apartment and then understand which furniture I need.
I'm sorry it took so long to answer, it's been a day, it's hard to adapt.
Is that enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, have this opportunity to hug you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how you feel.
For the baby, there's already a bed and a bath that I found for the first time.
Don't forget that you promised to help me as soon as you could, but don't give me the last one.
I want to make a haircut called a hat.
Oleg's sick, sick and coughing.
Only I'll be a little bit later - about 8:00, okay?
I don't want any misunderstandings with you.
Because I'm worried that it's gonna be okay!
Because we didn't even talk about it with these excarcies!
I understand how important this is to you!
I'm not talking about myself.
How are you feeling today?
Hey, I'm sorry, I just woke up, didn't sleep well.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was disappointed that Collea and I had a bad start yesterday in translating the test.
I will ask whether Gregory Denisenka or Jonaszek) for some help with math.
Maybe there's something I can do for them too.
If that's possible, I'd like to pick up mathematical terms in the weekend.
Geometry is difficult at all, but we have to work with the Wheel so that there are no mistakes.
Thank you for the Test Jobs
We too look forward to that.
Well, she's very happy about any gift.
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number.
Last night at the 402 bus stop, I met a Ukrainian woman named Victoria.
This girl is a kid, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay out of it.
Now we agreed to be friends.
And last night, I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine to feel my relationship.
The branch office in Room No. 29 is dedicated to providing and processing requests for help
Turns out so I ordered a backup card.
No, I'm just a man.
So she doesn't get scared that nobody's gone.
The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babin Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kiev, we celebrated 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yar.
I had the privilege of speaking after three heads of State, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of “the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, peaceful and secure Europe.
This foundation we must defend is also part of our responsibility to our history.”
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "there can be only one answer for us Germans: never again!
Fight must last."
Today, Russia attacks a peaceful country, bombes and kills thousands of civilians, starves the inhabitants of the cities it blocks and causes them to die of disease.
Russian forces have fired massively at Ukrainians, even visibly similar to those in Babin Jar.
For over a month, the Germans see it in real-time news.
Yes, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian assistance, as well as weapons, which were not so long ago unimaginable.
Germany is delaying the delivery of the heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means more than just opposing the swastika.
This means fighting all possible means against massacres, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risk and sacrifice to conquer evil and stop the atrocities that take place in Ukraine.
One song for you tonight.
We agree, agree on a tour, and write when to be gathered
All were sick only Lydia wasn't sick they had omicron new kind of horse
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
This is a ticket I use instead of a car.
Declare the lateness of the documents.
The ticket cost me 2,000 guineas at the headmaster.
Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership is no longer a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67 percent of the Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18 percent of the respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Gydness, the flight of Victor Yanukovic, the anexie of Krim, and the beginning of the Donbasi war, NATO’s opponents began to fall, and its supporters, on the contrary, to increase.
Since the outbreak of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have recorded a record level of support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – over 75%.
Despite the support of Ukraine's accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO has provided in the context of war, there are now many criticisms of the Alliance and the country members – for the untimely provision of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to "freak" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its desire for membership in the Alliance through the Russian Federation if it can stop the war and that Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military guarantees.
In the new episode of "The Curse of the Question" with the editor of "European Truth" talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance has been criticized in vain, why our prospects for NATO membership are closer than ever in history, and why the security guarantees discussed in the battles with Russia can become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think's here?
I have a volt partner that my application is under review.
I gave it to you through this mobile plugin.
We don’t have a visa, we need to go to the convention center and find out how to do it, because it was processed in Poland, where we didn’t get visas, but we got a pestel.
We'll write to you.
Denis was in a good mood today.
I arranged for a boy from Ukraine who I met yesterday to meet outside the school to show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
'Cause I don't like it like that, I don't have enough for a long time.
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic sent T-72 tanks and infantry combat vehicles to Ukraine.
I'm going to leave the kids alone waiting for three or four years and going home because I can't leave them anymore.
And the brothers are six to seven in the morning.
Yes, there was a heart condition.
I had sincere feelings for this man, but he did not do very well and I left him.
After a while, he returned and asked me to forgive him.
I said no to him.
Then, after a while, he called him for a heart surgery.
I asked him to just sleep with me, and I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost half a year.
During that time, we had a lot of communication.
I had a parallel job problem at the time.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual help.
And I was thinking, maybe you really need to look at him differently.
And he offered to marry me, and two days later he died.
Thus, God has chosen our own fate.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he only speaks Czech.
I wanted to say that I was able to find a place to live, and that's what I'm so glad I have a place to live and a place to be with a baby.
Shouldn't I have mentioned it before?
( ) Because I helped watch children in the family.
Don't apologize, just write the sentences you didn't understand.
I understand myself that the translator does not always translate the text correctly.
I don't know how to talk to the doctor, is she supposed to give the paper?
They must have forgotten the guests, I put them in the closet.
Maybe it's time for you to go to bed to work tomorrow.
Whether someone can help, the things needed for a woman XS size or S size are 165. And for her daughters (8, 10, 12 years) Thank you.
That time in the ice, I bought two packs and my mom bought two.
It's very nice of you, thank you.
You made me feel better.
All right, let's talk about something else, and I'm still awake, I'm still asleep, and I'm dreaming about bombarding...
God never gets late, all his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me:)
I understand very well the value of under-skilled work, and I realize that the kind of work I had at home in Kiev I won't be able to have the money I made at home, and I won't get here now either.
But just sit down and do nothing. I can't do anything, because then all the bad thoughts go into my head, so you have to do something physical.
At the airport, documents are filed from 7 a.m. to 7 a.m., and at another time you can just wait.
Wardmire came back at 4:00 a.m.
So we took them with us.
We slept with Vic in the kitchen, they put them in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job and go to the airport with them.
When you have it, write and find out what's next...
'Cause I don't have a place anymore.
Sir, these are the invitations of Ukrainian children who will enter the gymnasium.
Yeah, but I'm doing it hard.
Okay, text me when it's comfortable.
I don't know about work yet, but I'd like to make sure I have kids in kindergarten and school.
It's better that we change the changes sometimes?
I'm sorry, I really don't have any missed calls from midday.
I'm offering work, cleaning bathrooms and toilets, washing three windows, dust cleaning.
Work is about 3-4 hours, 800green is a one-time amount, from 1904 on Tuesday, at 2:00.
I hope I'll just tell you that we're good.
Can I call you?
Or can you write your wife's contact?
Grisko started coughing, and I want to ask you what I can buy at the pharmacy.
I'd like to ask you some advice.
In our home, Hannah is considered to be the root of the name Anja.
She was handed over by her uncle from home.
Made the English version, added new partners
Write to him if you need anything.
Just don't forget me, please.
Mondays and Wednesdays are different?
Thank you very much, you're doing so much for our family.
You need help to stay in the pool
But that's what I think.
My uncle gave her the rollers and the skating board from home, she rolled on them at home, so it's got
I got up at 9:00, too, and I'm just making breakfast right now.
I'm sorry you're talking to me on your weekend, and I hope I'm not very annoying.
We want to report a change in the residence and also submit documents for the continuation of the map
We're now delivering medical oxygen to all hospitals in our country.
And I forgot to tell you there's gonna be a snack tomorrow.
One mother said she'd make doughnuts for the kids.
He comes to visit you.
Please tell me, do you have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments a month ahead of you, even if for an approximate understanding of what days?
I won't remember any of this schedule.
The Russian army is threatening to launch rocket attacks on Kiev, saying, "We never did this before."
Conashenkova's direct language: "We're trying to sabotage and target Ukrainian troops on objects in the Russian Federation.
If such cases persist, the Russian armed forces will strike decision centres, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously been deterred.”
The Russians launched rocket attacks on Kiev from the first days of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian occupation forces.
On February 25, Russia’s remnants of rockets, which hit the Ukrainian PPO system, fell on a apartment building in the city’s late months.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a large surface on Valery Lobanovsky’s Prospect.
On March 1, the Russians took on a TV cart near Babin’s Jaru, killing five passersbys.
On March 2, U.S. POS systems hit the South Railway Station with Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defence building.
On March 14, the wreckage of a hit-and-run missile by the occupiers broke down a house and a trolleybus on Kurenovc in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential massage on the Vinogradar, killing one person, and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russia’s rockets destroyed the modern RTR Retroville on the Vineyard, killing at least four people.
The mayor of Kiev, Vitaly Clichko, announced on April 13, that the inhabitants of the capital, who had been evacuating the city, had yet to return early.
The army explained to the local authorities that Russians could still launch rockets at Kiev, and there were many mines and unexploded ordnance around the capital.
The Department of Defense of Ukraine’s main intelligence agency warned on April 12, that Russians were planning a series of terrorist attacks in the territory of the Russian Federation to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, a naphtobasa exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an aerial attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
Early in April, the local authorities of Belgorod claimed that a “Ukrainian projectile” had fallen near the city.
Evidently, the elites in Washington, D.C. and Berlin are thrown into cold sweat from the very idea that the Nazi destroyers would kill Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky does not speak to them as much as to their choice and society in general.
Through his speeches in parliaments and before thousands of crowds on the major cities of Europe, the Ukrainian leader has done something that none of his predecessors have been able to reach.
Green doesn't convince European politicians to do anything for Ukraine; it convinces European nations that choose the politicians.
And these speeches, this sophisticated alloy of power, the touchingness, and the times of despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
As long as the same Biden is categorically opposed to closing the sky, 70 percent of its fellow citizens are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is opposed to the rapid introduction of Ukraine, this process is already under way.
I understand, so I don't want to be considered a fraud.
The baskets you're going to pick are better to give to people who need them more.
I can come to you and decide where I am.
But the air's clean, this is plus.
It says that I have a two-on-one tariff, and I asked you to do the Internet.
I don't understand the terms of the tariff.
Do we have any other room today, or, as usual, just the stairs from the top to the bottom?
So I'm on my way to the train.
But I won't stop loving you, you're everything to me.
This loan is handled by a financial consultant.
So it takes a few days.
Katya asked for the Internet, can I give her a password?
I thought you and Milan didn't shoot each other.
Super, then my husband's gonna give me a ride because he has a car from the building company he works for today.
We are very happy and grateful that our Nick and grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you very much for your invitation!
We also hope that after the war, we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!
one needs to be cut into four parts.
one of these particles can be used for 2-3 days, but strip every hour
I'm interested in architecture and color
I'm really glad you're okay.
At 4:20 p.m., the concert starts at 6:00, and then I'm free again.
And now I want to eat something sweet.
So I'll make tea and get some candy.
I've moved to the school page and I'm going to try and order Ani lunch for tomorrow.
But I love to go out on weekends.
So can we go over there tomorrow, find out what's going on?
My name is Sasha, and I came from Luganski to Prague.
I'm a certified masseuse and a 27-year-old nurse in neurology.
I offer medicinal massages, a rehab gym for children and adults.
I speak Ukrainian, Russian, and Czech intensively.
Contact: ---- I wish the Czechs could write to you via a translator, SMS is not here, they don't have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call, you won't agree.
You really don't want this price?
It helps people to see what they deserve and what they have for it.
If you don't need a primelist, I won't put it on.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I'll do it.
Dores, you didn't want to write to me today... something.
Don't worry, I'm not here to ask.
Actually, I'm just asking for attention today.
I have so much to say today, so I ask you to be patient.
Are you all right with your imagination?
You live your normal life, you go to work, you plan on shopping, you plan on vacation.
You have dreams.
You're planning on buying that dress you saw last night at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can't take it.
He's chipping for the old reality.
You call to work, see if you can go out to work today or not.
You decide to leave your children at home.
As long as things get clear.
There's hope... it won't be long.
Now... they're gonna make a deal... something's gonna happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
I don't have anyone and nowhere.
I've got $50 in my pocket.
Many of our leaders did not pay for our work.
Where am I going? Who needs me?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything from the house... you drive 1,000 miles.
You don't know what to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag the kids all over Prague.
We don't know how much it's worth, we don't know how much it's worth.
And from every iron, we don't have one.
It's our choice to stay there and alert the children to danger, or to try to escape here.
She was very happy with those hearts and the things the kids gave her when she came to school.
You should have called me when you arrived.
I'll text you at dinner.
Yes, I believe only in God and I believe in my life
I don't have the strength to do this anymore.
I thought you were in love with some Ukrainian girl and you didn't have time to communicate.
I figured it out on the menu, I even ordered it.
2. Would you be interested in sharing arrangements with your Czech neighbors, friends, and community?
If so, what kind of species?
Please send a page with a visa or a import seal (red with a date).
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian assistance.
Mrs. Libuše, did you pay for the crèche?
Because I can't understand.
You're doing us so much good...
We owe you a great debt... thank you!
Yeah, I know that's very good.
I'll send you a picture of the lady's visit I'm teaching English.
Well, you'll write it down tomorrow, see if you can meet or not, and maybe your plans will change...
Good morning. We've got enough. It'd be nice to know a man from Ukraine.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
Don't you want to meet me after 4:00?
What are your general impressions from the first week
Karina brought us the medicine the other day, and we drink them.
I can work with lying sick and invalid children.
But you have to say that I only speak Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have that.
Can I swab you for a piece of work?
Because it's only anti-bacterial gel.
I'm not sure, or I'm not really in town... about half a dozen.
What services/activities do you think are needed/unavailable for older people?
I don't know because I haven't texted the bank yet and I haven't taken the bank cards, and the kids have removed the bank attachment with it. They've really upset me.
Then text me if you want to go.
Today, our joy is that our city of Butch was freed from the occupiers, and our armies have passed.
They're looking for Russians in basements and apartments.
The whole city has been replaced, and the switching work will begin.
And John would see if there was something that needed repair or something else to do.
Diana, as you wish, maybe he'll be ashamed, I don't know.
Panas wants to stay home, says he's tired of us, and he wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We'll do the mazanese and do the homework.
These are small businesses that have opened volunteer headquarters in their premises and shops.
They're tractors who actually go to the field under fire, because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who agree to go into humconvoys today to temporarily occupied areas in order to get help and get people out of there.
These are heroic leaders who, fearlessly, go into the battle zone, calm and help refugees in the wagons, and at peaceful stations, help volunteers to load a humanitarian in the wagons.
These are the gas stationers who were standing on the Gitomir Road in the early days of the war and patiently treated the frightened and nervous.
They are communicators who carry garbage under fire, repair pipes, and power lines to provide the people with the necessary supplies.
They are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining, and at the free moment they still volunteer to collect the first aid kits on the front.
We're in Ukraine, running out of juice when the little ones have leaves)
Please tell me, little kids-- what age do you mean?
My daughter's eight years old, is that an acceptable age?
I'm looking for a house for my daughter and me for three or four days every day to come to Czech Republic and hand over passports for a visa to Canada.
There's a lot of people in Warsaw at the Visa Center and there's no on-line queue.
I wanted to come one day, but it's far, it takes a lot of time on the train, and it's gonna be hard for the kid.
So I decided to look for a home in or near Prague.
No, we're fine.
Yesterday's Devices Where to Bring
But I can't change the password when I follow a link, because I have this mistake:
It's in the microwave, something's burning.
In Ukraine, operators of the largest banks are always in contact with customers 24 hours a day and all questions are resolved quickly :)
Nothing, I'll get used to new realities.
I don't like it, and I want you to know that.
You can edit the report, the most important thing is the truth.
Yeah, TV's full of it.
We've already arranged for the fridges. Some Czech boys responded at 1:00 p.m.
I want to go to you, give you a strong hug, and kiss you.
At 7:30, I'm reading the history of the world theater to actors, directors and theatricians.
Evening, I appreciate the objects. After dinner,
Grisko's still asleep, crying at night, licking his teeth.
I'm on the phone right now with everyone I know about Lviv, and a lot of people died.
The Czech Republic began issuing visas after March 22, according to me.
By that time, they'd put the stamps like this and then compare the stamps to the visceral.
Ukraine's Overseas Election District (Ukrainian PLO) is an electoral district that unites electoral areas outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting rooms at Ukrainian embassies and consulates and military bases abroad, [vinoca 1] where the Ukrainian peacekeeping forces (Kosovo and DDR Congo) are present.[1] The District Election Commission for the Concord Election District is the Central Electoral Commission.
In the foreign electoral district, there are only popular ballots: presidential and people’s deputies’ elections and nationwide referendums.
Local elections are not held.
They're at the station near the mother and child's room.
Says he doesn't know where they're going anymore.
Are you mad at me?
I'm going to take a picture in my bathing suit.
I don't need any more money. I borrowed a long term from a friend.
I wanted to say that I've already connected a Czech mobile number.
I didn't need another device to do that, so I went to O2 and they made me an electronic SIM card that I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
I'm very uncomfortable, Sunday works and I can't.
You said you had a wrecked washing machine, take it for yourself, you need it too.
We don't have enough carpets, swollen carpets, plates. Children don't have pyjamas and nothing to move into.
Good morning, I'll be leaving at 10:00... write the address again, there's a missing text.
I don't want to torture you or myself, I'm gonna get myself killed.
So that would be good, but I know that there were no free places, and in principle, they've got all the lessons on schedule right now, and they're pretty good at teaching.
Do you have a meat cutter to make the stuff?
Let's do it after the big day.
Did your mom say something hurt you last night?
She can't tell them what she wants, and she doesn't understand what they're saying.
I went to school today too.
I saw Christine’s mother today, but she didn’t even say hello.
Very tasty apples, what kind of class is that?
The head of the Office of President Andrew Jermack announced that Russia was starting a "feasibility operation" on the weapons that the allies were handing over to us.
The direct language of Jermak is, "They understand that they're losing war, they're seeing their backwardness, and they want to beat up the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last faucets is the total destruction of the U.S.S.S.S.S. 300.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
We know Russian scripts, one of them.
They can launch fakes that the Ukrainian soldiers are making the appearance of weapons from the allies, and they're massively moving to arming the Russian army.
I'd like to warn you about those fags right away.
For the weapons in the hands of the U.S.S. soldiers are exclusively sending the enemy to that world.
Would you excuse me if I forgot to ask you how much it cost a garden in the month, and would it work in the summer?
Everyone is given the strength.
There's a lot more dull stories, believe me.
So I needed to survive to change.
The Torah says, and God created a bad beginning in man to make it change spiritually, to become better in the course of life.
It's your house, you can invite anyone you want.
How do we find this lady in Social Security tomorrow before we go to the hospital we wanted to visit the city hall?
He listened to his mother and didn't come with us.
I know it's been hard for you.
And I'll make you happy.
After what you wrote me today, I'm happy.
I hope you meant that seriously.
I'm watching the announcement a lot already taken. Now it's hard for us to do this.
I'm sorry, I didn't get the whole point.
Didn't you get a call today about changing the mobile operator's rate?
I'm sorry, but I can't count on anyone in this life.
Today I was offered a job for every day.
I'm sorry, but I agreed to work there already.
Thank you for responding and wishing you a good help.
Perhaps your father told us that there are Jehovah’s witnesses among us, but I do not profess any religion.
However, she was baptized in the Orthodox Church.
I respect all religions based on love.
I read the Bible, the Koran, began reading the Torah.
I believe that there are no mediators between man and God.
You can also think about not putting the fridge at the door of the boys’ room.
Thank you very much. You really helped me.
We're looking for a derjopione to clean up the house here in the village.
Offer 150 kroner/year, other cooperation with them.
I'm afraid of chemical care.
I'm just worried about how we're gonna be talking to you.
But we can just look at each other's jokes.
I went to my mom's alone, and there was a sister and a friend who was going to go, and Anastasia asked to go with them.
Where's the good barber?
Good afternoon Victor approved this house only doesn't know how to help this gentleman with the documents to get paid from the airship and said that with the furniture bank so far not there in the availability of furniture
Thank you very much for your hospitality in your sister-in-law.
We've got good doctors here, too... bye.
We've already cooked food at home, and from the top, we can't find the keys.
I'll take the underwear for the fifth guest, and the pillow and the extra pillow are in the apartment?
So, as we get in touch with the owners, there's no contact, I need a long-term dwelling, and we're working and we can pay, if you can help.
At the end of every description, you have contact with the owner.
You can use this online translation from Ukrainian to Ukrainian and vice versa for communication.
Whatever, we're four on one bed in a room where you can't even afford it, thank you very much.
Well, did you click on the links I sent you above?
On each of them you have a free offer of housing, a description, a contact with the owner, and a photo.
I can't find contact without an e-mail, if I'm sorry, which is closer to Czech Krumlov's place of residence than we do in Czech Krumlov and now we live in Prague.

We cleaned up the whole room and moved to the second room.
The international community continues to express shock and resentment after evidence has emerged that Russian forces have committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these reports as “provocation.”
“The report of the murdered, raped and severely injured Russian troops of Ukrainian civilians is worth the conviction”, said New Zealand's prime minister, Jasinda Ardern, to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer the world for what they did,” she added, noting that its government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its struggle against Russian invasion.
The Prime Minister of Japan, Fumio Kissida, called the incidents a “violation of international law”.
The allegations were made following reports that hundreds of civilians had been shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the outskirts of Kiev, in Bucha, by Russian troops who had left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
Photographs depicting the bodies of civilians killed with tied hands shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced to the radio interview on April 4, that there were signs that Russian troops had committed “war crimes” in Butch.
“What happened in Butch requires a new round of sanctions and very clear steps,” Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be directed towards Russian export of coal and oil.
The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sánchez, stated that Russian troops could go so far that they had committed a “genocide” in Butch.
“We will make sure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished,” said Sánchez in Madrid.
In her performance on public television late on April 3, Russia’s MSS spokesman Maria Zacharova rejected the charge as a “provocation.”
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO had “committed” images to discredit Russia.
“In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minute after the material appeared does not raise any doubt as to who ordered the story,” said Zacharova.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Defence also stated without evidence that the Bouchi image was “a further order of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Butch.
On April 4, Russia’s follow-up committee published a statement in which it announced the “investigation” of allegations of “knownly false information” by Ukraine about Russian military operations in Butch.
The President of Ukraine, Volodymir Zelenski, appeared on April 3, accusing Russian troops of “genocide” in the city, and told the Kremlin’s leaders that they should come to Butchi to see what their soldiers had done.
“I want all leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being implemented,” said Zelensky in videotape, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there's a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shooting at the police," he said.
He stated that Russian President Volodymyr Putin and Russian military personnel should be responsible for the actions of the army in Ukraine.
“When we find people tied up behind their backs and decapitated, I don't understand,” he said about scenes of victims scattered in the streets of Butchi, cities about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, a reporter from the Ukrainian Service Radio Liberty saw on the streets a small city of bodies as if they were civilians.
In one place alone, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists have seen at least 21 bodies in various places in Butchi.
The bodies of one group of nine people – all of them civilians – were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to the locals, used Russian forces as a base.
The victims seem to have been killed from a close distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities claimed that the bodies of at least 410 civilians had been found in the area of Kiev, which had been controlled by Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, it's all there, we bought it from the list.
"They've been told, "Kyeva is not there." "How the occupiers had taken the Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus."
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by horrendous things, such as looting, rape, murder, and torture.
There is another point in this list that is now much less known – the removal of the local population to the enemy’s territory.
About the middle of March, Russian occupiers “evacuate” Ukrainians from temporarily occupied localities into their territory and within the area of Belarus, which President Lukashenko himself actually gave to Russian military police.
"Ukrainian Truth" found the expelled Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text have been forced to evacuate voluntarily outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from despair.
Fortunately, they're alive and maintaining contact with their family.
However, in view of the claims made by Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe pressure.
So in Melitopol, the Russians stole the staff of the second nursing home, took the children out of there without their parents, including the 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of a dead Ukrainian champion from Joseph Zacepsky's swim.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Valie moved to Guestomel a few months before the war.
Alexander was the one who got a job at Antonov Airport, which is about two miles [2.5 km] from the village.
The family settled in a military town, although it was a civilian.
As true plastics, Denis and Marina gathered their alarmed suitcases in advance, but they couldn't evacuate in the morning of the 24th of February.
They did not have their own car, and the suburban buses no longer took anyone.
About 12:00 p.m. on February 24, they saw helicopters with a Latin letter V followed by the first rockets.
One of them got into a nearby house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three long weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, about 40 persons were hidden in their basement.
Not all of them decided.
"On the 6th evening of February 24th, people came into the driveway who spoke and did not speak Russian and not Ukrainian.
They say, "Is there anyone?" I say, "Get out!"
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.
All the men were questioned if they had served in the army.
The women were told, "We've come to defend you on Ramzan Kadir's instructions."
It was the Chechen OMON, not even the army, the young boys of 25-35 years old.
They said, "We were helping the Ukrainians in the war, Sasko White (commanding the nationalist UNA-UNOSO movement Viking, who fought on the Chechen side of the first Russian-Chetsian war, UP), and now we're here to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what was missing.
We say that the water, there was a big problem with it.
They broke the store, took the goods out of there under the "the Russians will take it anyway" charge, and brought us six bouts.
There are videos on the Internet where children thank Kadir for food.
So they're the ones who, after the shop was looted, brought the cowboy and said, "We know it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmatovich."
No one especially wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid says, "You have seven days to hand over our phones," they laughed.
They also regularly separated themselves from the Russians.
They said it was good that they had come because they didn't want war, because the Ukrainians were backed up, and they were good, and they said, "Putin is a bastard, Kadir too, but there's nothing we can do, because our families are there."
And mostly, they didn't fight, they went robbing shops, they were looting.
They put them on their own, they tied one of them to one leg, they tied them to one leg, and they put their white scotch on the other, and they called it "militia."
They arrived in Ukraine unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... when they were beaten in Butch, so they didn't even take the dead, they asked us, "Do you have artillery?"
More than that, we had defrauds — the Chechens didn’t know each other, and in the early days they asked for passwords to find out whether they were their own or foreigner.
We had them by March 13th, followed by a Russian OMON, followed by an Omian landing.
They put 30-40 units of technology between the houses -- ours were always in it from the Bayractars.
But these came and told us that the VMS is gone, but there's "Azov," and they say, "Azov" is like 100 thousand in Ukraine.
Called "Kyiv has already given up" and it's been going on since early March.
On one occasion a Russian came to us — either an officer of the Desant or a representative of the FSB — and said that there would be evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio -- it was about Butch, Gostomel, and we thought maybe we had a green corridor.
From the beginning, we gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're being taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
What they said was, "Well, you have to regret the mentality of your children!"
How it worked: they put us in the basement and started shooting from under the house -- or the Grades or the Minomets.
And then it came back... the houses in the neighborhood just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct involvement on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to pass on to the border and the Red Cross.
Part of it didn't go, saying it was for traitors of their homeland -- he said, "You're shot up there, you're sold to organs."
We were taken through the Chernobylbyl, and the roads were on both sides of the road, and the equipment was broken down, although the whiteros told us that Russians were moving to them immediately.
A lot of caponers, buried technology, and soldiers.
At the White Sea pass, we went through improvised control, many people were without any documents because they burned down.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, and we were given tea.
And here we hear the shots! There's a rocket fired, and there's a way we can see that Iskander was working on Kiev.
Although they from the Belorussian Red Cross said, "No, these planes fly, they turn on the border."
But we're from aviation, we have education, we know what this is.
Then we were loaded on a bus and taken to the Chonkie sanatorium near Gomel.
His headman, Wenger Vasil Stepanovich, came and said, "Here I am the forelock, I am from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenk won't stop until these thieves are slaughtered.
Poor people are suffering!
And we've got Lukashenko so good!
Whatever he says, he will."
They offered to interview the Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The sanatorium administration told us, "You're already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the United Nations representation (at least so called) spread misinformation that men cannot travel to Poland.
Many believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents — our daughter had no foreign passport.
We were supposed to get it on Monday, and the war broke out on Thursday.
At the Ukrainian consulate, we received no help, and at the station in Minska, we were told that without passports no one would get on the bus.
I'll tell you what the Belarusian volunteers really helped us.
We were settled in Minsk, and we were accompanied.
In the sanatorium, no force was held.
Our second group of migrating representatives said that you could live here for a maximum of a week, because Belarus is not Europe, and there's no payment here.
We found an internal transporter who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
As we traveled near Mosir (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border – U.S.), we saw ballistic missile launches in Ukraine: the rocket first flew out, lighted up beautifully, and then went off.
People who boarded a bus in Moziri told us that Russians were constantly shooting from polygons.
But I can say that white men don't want to fight at all.
The generals are being released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was invited.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is located, is not believed at all.
They say, "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."
It is not understood that their polygons are used to shoot at Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting to take us to Estonia.
Now we're registering, deciding what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are probably as much now as Estonian flags."
Marina lived in a military town in Gostomel with her brother's family, his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nieces and asked them to collect the most basic items and documents.
In the evening, they went to sleep in the basement of a nearby house.
Marina herself could not return home, and in principle she could not — the house is gone.
No one really knew about the evacuation.
Can't you go downtown on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything. We're always waiting for you.
Thank you for the deal, the towers are beautiful.
And in this little apartment, there's no wi-fi, mostly on all your questions, and now I don't know what to do, and the kids on Monday's online, and the Internet isn't there.
So I'm going to live with two Ukrainian women and their children, or is this a family that's ready to accept us?
The Koran says: “Even a leaf from a tree falls from its known place. ”
The kids are learning online, I'm a salesman and a cook, but I can work both in the field and in the cleaning shop, which is a different maryan specialist in the development of wars. She can work at home, and Marian's friend has no specialty, which is different.
Can we agree on how best to do this?
On April 1, the city’s head of Bouchi, Anatoly Fedorook, delivered a joyful message that the Ukrainian military released the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupiers were thrown out of the entire Kiev region.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians would have felt at that time was overshadowed by horror and hatred, as it was known at the same time that at least 280 civilians had been shot by Russians alone.
They were killed just on the street, some were tied up and shot in the back, some of the dead were minors.
The village chief, Motizin Olgu Suhenko, her husband, Igor, and Alexander’s son, were found murdered and tortured and kidnapped on March 23.
Olga’s bodies and Alexander’s were in a brotherly grave, and Igor’s were in a sewer.
Both sides of the track 20 km from Kiev found the bodies of several stripped women wrapped in a carpet.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there won't be anyone at home.

President Volodymir of Zelenski stated that certain types of weaponry being provided by Western partners had come too late.
He said that in an interview with Associated Press, published by the Office of the President, he writes "European Truth."
"All the equipment, all they're sending, for some kinds of equipment, it's done late.
So what, when we're talking, for example, about Mariupol, when you're losing thousands of people, and now what?
I see 100 percent support from leaders in some countries, that's true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," said Zelensky.
On the question of whether it was enough weaponry for Ukraine to make a difference in the war, the president said, "No, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, there would be no war, or it would have looked different.
"She'd be different, we'd have close neighbors' shoulder, we could fight together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be a war,' he added.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain has promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armoured personnel carriers and anti-ship weapons.

Thank you, something needs to be done, but I can't go anywhere anymore. I've got to cook and learn words, and I've got a half-ten tomorrow. We've been booked for 11 hours.
Marina, but indeed, if you need help with the city, my husband and I will.
My friend and I baked last night, try if you want.
Everyone was sick, and they had symptoms, but we didn’t go to the hospital.
I just got a call from a woman in Dameidlo and told me that they were e-mailing me information about what was going on and I never answered.
She spoke Czech and I understood her so much.
But on e-mail, I don't have a letter from the ladies.
I need a little plaster to pull a failure on the plaster.
Type or type of household activity
We're looking for a housekeeper to clean up here in the village.
Proposal 150 kroner/year.
Another cooperation is in harmony with pleasure.
The date you will agree with the lady on your own.
Of course, but I'm knocking you off the bar.
Men also have many nuances
He was a very rich man, but he liked me because I had a life view. I met him, and then I left him.
He was a rich man, and after a while he called and told him that he had had a heart surgery.
He asked me to just hang out with him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man, and he thought that maybe I was his toy, and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer.
"There was a car standing in my yard, like a crocodile, and she was opening hails.
And they kept me in the house, then they took me to the basement, and there were a lot of people there, about 400 people, and there was nothing to breathe.
And what about the house that you've been dropping pictures?
I haven't really gotten there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already simplified this facade.
The last two videos I'll see when the Internet works normally.
Is there a dress code at work or is it not possible to walk in what it is?
All right, he'll come over there and take them.
I'm not greedy for anything.
I know I can't sit in you. I have to work.
Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 or even Ukrainian television.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1+1 is a pro-presidential, propaganda channel, not interesting to me at all.
What happened at the stop with the man that the police came and the ambulance came?
Diana didn't answer me, neither did you.
All right, all I have to do is print pictures for the kids, so it'll be fine.
But perhaps you need a more detailed knowledge of Czech.
I'm worried you'll be satisfied with my work.
In this case, I know a girl who's a Ukrainian, but she's studying in the Czech Republic for tourism specialty.
You really don't want to come home with the kids for a minute, calmly and with your grandmother.
I want you to be with me, wake up next to you.
In general, it is difficult in a foreign country, and every day more and more they want to go home.
Mrs Agatha, if you want this photo, I'll take a picture.
Thank you for trying to make life here as much as possible.
I'll remember you for the rest of my life.
And I'm going to remember and smile at you.
So thank you very much, Anya's still planning the geolocation route in the phone so that we can get there faster.
I have to pay the tariff, I have to control it.
How can I see how much we use?
How am I supposed to pay?
"I'm telling her that "the television and radio remodel" has been tightened up through import details, and friends and acquaintances have been warned not to be overwhelmed when they're calling."
"For the whole month, we hide from the mother-in-law of war.
So far, it's working.
However, in Plymka (Cuska – UP) the fur has been froze on its paws and back legs — perhaps due to stress, changes in feed, and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but stress is not on me, unfortunately.
The bottle, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions."
Because of Olga's poor hearing and spending most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law spent the month living in an apartment with her "incognito".
And April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova, for the first time in her life, took up arms.
"33 days I lived with her as a partisan in the apartment.
Both the war and the fact that I was standing next to her were concealed — formally coming as usual for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend talked, I gave her the receptionist -- she listened for four hours, then sang for two hours."
The radio receiver was always near the bed.
My mother - in - law spends most of her time in her room.
He didn't hear well, so he let me be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "thorns," I hid in my room.
First of all, I hid a receiver and a television set from her.
Then I called everyone who's in touch with her, and that's 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but war.
I'm asking my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end.
It's April 17th - I have two apartments:)
Good evening, I didn't think about it.
Hey, if we need our help tomorrow, we can come.
Do you have to order lunch, can you take lunch from the house? Do you have to print it out, or do you have to print it out and I'll sign it?
I'm offering the haircuts of a man, a woman, a child with a visit to you, all those who are saturated, please write in a personal message, price:
I understand you, and I won't complain, but in my situation, I'm still looking here.
I'm telling you, the embassy is here,
The British who defended Mariupol in the U.S.S.A. says that they are ready to surrender to the Russians
The British, who is a military officer of the U.S. Navy Marine Brigade, who is involved in the defence of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would build weapons and surrender to Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Aidin Aislin, a British who served in the ZSU lava since 2018, Air Force citing Aislin's family and friends, Atlas News citing the words of a friend of Aislin, who spoke to him
Twitter Aislin said, "We received a message from him, "It's 48 days ago, we tried everything we could to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to go prisoner to the Russian forces.
We don't have any food or ammunition left.
Thank you, everyone, I hope the war will soon end."
Details: Aislin served in the 36th separate U.S. Marine Brigade, which is involved in the Mariupol Defense Operation.
Air Force reporters contacted En Wood's mother, and she confirmed that her son had announced on the phone that they were planning to surrender to captivity.
The second military officer, Brennan Philips, also confirmed to journalists that in the last telephone conversation Icelyn spoke about the plans of their subdivision from the capitalization.
According to him, the crew ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists of Atlas News contacted a friend of his who said that Aislin's unit intended to surrender to Russian subdivisions in order not to get caught without weapons and bullets in the hands of the so-called “cadiers”.
The social media also used audio recordings of a telephone conversation where Acelyn seemed to be talking to an American friend who was planning to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Acelyn said that they tried to get out of town in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British told him that he was threatened at Instagram by a private military company called Wagner.
Aislin was a social worker in Newark on Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to fight against the terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ZSU lava and sworn in.
Aislin's friends and loved ones called Johnny, and in social media, he's more famous under Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know if we're together or not.
But it won't be easy, you'll have to find him...
You asked me to come with you, I agreed if everything was okay.
Thank you, before you need to, you've done so much for us, we're very grateful to you.
If you don't want to write to me one day, I'll wait.
Hello Natali, please pour flowers outside at the front door.
I'd like to learn Czech too.
I'd like you to get some rest and think about yourself.
Today you'll have to put on face cream.
Yeah... thank you very much. I didn't even expect to get that person, health and luck!!!!!!!!
Little Dust is not ashamed anymore?
Ondrej and his father came to visit us.
No one else came in, although there were many wheelchairs on the street.
We're home today.
The kids have learned lessons, they're playing now.
I have to go to Lydle for food after lunch.
You have me.
You know I love you.
I'll do anything for you.
How can I prove this to my love?
I want a chance for us to be together.
To prove it to you.
You may have had many disappointments.
Let me make you happy.
Grandma won't be able to, her legs are very painful and across.
How much does it cost to rent a double apartment in Prague?
Will all the parents come?
It's almost the same.
Family's good, I've got my mom, three brothers and a husband.
One brother in the wars in Mariupol, the other in Zaporizha, and a man from Kiev today were transferred to Harkow.
The phone calls every day says everything's fine, and if anyone knows him, they won't tell the truth.
I wanted to see you, but I wanted to do some more work.
I'll ask the man in the morning if he can make it tomorrow.
When you come home, write me, please, I'd need to talk to Daniel.
The big-time attackers for their losses were playing full-on in the fight.
Teacher Dmitr Pawlitsky, an unknown relative, was shot at by a young man named Boris Oleksiank.
Their bodies have been thrown into “a deep pit that has been buried in the ground”.
Behind the memory “there was some dead silence in the city”.
Slightly, one of the residents ran from house to house.
On the streets, the bodies of the Bolsheviks were always seen
And I might actually follow you, I need you, I can't without you.
3. What kind of activity/activity would help you or your friends better adapt to life in the Czech Republic?
But you won't, because the railroad is closed down.
You get to the bridge where the reconstruction is done, you tell me you've come and I'll come to you.
A Better Future Forewarns

Yeah, I stopped waking up in the middle of the night.
I just wake up very early in the morning without an alarm.
I sleep four or five hours, but I'm already asleep.
Marina couldn't wake me up today when she arrived)) But it takes time, it has to pass.
If I understand correctly from school, they'll send us an entry letter to talk the menu
Well, we'll try to get us on Tuesday to social services.
Then, when the fill is cold and the toast is ready, the blind pies and the roasting of them on a small fire on the oil.
Okay, I'm sure to ask him.
As soon as we're set up tomorrow night, I'll pick it up on Tuesday.
I want to be able to repay all those who helped us because this was the last hope, really.
I am not afraid of work, as I lived in the village too, so I can and I like to work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
It's a very interesting tradition, we do this at Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved the 7176 law-promoting facility, which is called "To advance the monitoring of potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economy".
Surprisingly, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the economy has turned out to be... the place that members of the Watch Towering Council of Tenders and Tenders are meeting.
Initiators believe that making decisions by the supervisory board of the custodian in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve Ukraine’s national security problems.
We know that there are many new threats to the holding companies, but we don't know yet about any company that has come up with the need to physically attend the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is an excellent basis for “removing” all acquisitions in a difficult post-Greatness Revolution reform, including independent oversight of the board, and then setting up manual controls.
It's like it was before 2015.
Why should companies keep watch over the board, and who should join them?
Moreover, if one harmful legal instrument flies under patriotic slogans, others can fly tomorrow – for example, the government procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBA.
A lot of things can be written off for war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and the legal object 7176.
So on February 22, this rule was added to the comparative table of subject 5397.
In general, the desire to disengage the board in one way or another has been circulating among some of the people’s chosen ones for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but for the purpose of showing the possible effects of a legal instrument, let us consider the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then I'll give you my suggestions on how to deal with the issue of the management of the war.
The first deputy of the Minister of Economy, Denise Cudin, explained the need for such innovation with the risk of losing the Internet and other communication tools that would prevent remote oversight boards from doing so.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which could lead to the paralysis of the company's work.
We agree that such a risk is involved, but will he be able to prevent members of the supervisory board from moving to Ukraine?
Imagine a fairly cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory board (which make up most of the entire body) would put their personal security above the company’s interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In that case, according to the law, they could be released.
And then, more likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum needed by oversight to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to appoint new independent members of the supervisory board quickly, since the law provides for a competitive selection that lasts an average of 3 to 4 months.
Hence, the decision proposed by the 7176 law enforcer is likely not to be able to avoid losing the oversight board’s ability to make decisions, but rather to do so!
The popular deputy, the author of Dmitro Natallah's law-promoting body, provides other arguments for his support.
In particular, he notes that “many businesses, such as the Defence and Industrial Complex (PPC), are now in need of repositioning” and that “it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensational information from Vienna on Zoom.”
For starters, there is hardly any PKK in Ukraine that has oversight of the board.
The supervisory board is only in Ukropronprom, which essentially manages almost all of the PKK's strengths.
But even in Ucroboronprom, according to the law, the board has quite limited powers, and all its members carry out duties that are not free of charge.
The full power of Ucrobororomi is vested in the Director General, who will, by the way, make decisions about the need to relocate a PKK enterprise that is part of the company.
Moreover, such an argument does not stand out for criticism, either, because 7176 does not make any changes to the law governing the PKK secession.
Mr. Dmitro also uses his Facebook page to refer to the "emotional" category.
Such arguments tend to have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of the operations of the host companies and the banks, but let's try to figure out some of them: "respectful foreign experts at the first word "war," leaving Ukraine in 2021, but remain members of the supervisory board in Ukrainian state enterprises with a full salary of several hundred thousand currency, while Ukraine itself is actually suffering from war."
First of all, it's a manipulation -- most of these board members never lived in Ukraine, and they just came here periodically.
So it's not fair to say they're leaving Ukraine.
Second, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian board members have long been engaged in online sessions.
This tool has long been common in the world’s practice, with very different fields — business, education, medicine, and so on.
It is also worth remembering that membership in a watchdog is not a full-time job.
Typically, these people have other things to do, and that's what electronic communications help them to do.
Third, all these statements are read as claims only to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitro not express identical claims to members of the supervisory board who are Ukrainians?
Because they're not behind their company's location either.
To say the word, this is not the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from the oversight board, and war is only a new opportunity.
Welcome, I'm in Ukraine, looking for options for temporary family protection, two children with me.

We usually need an adult's passport.
In the Bróvarsk, Vishgorod, and Buchanan regions of Kyiv, which have been freed from the occupiers, a reinforced commanding hour of two days will be introduced.
The direct language of Pavluk: "In the towns of Brovarsky, Vishgorod and Buchan district, which were under Russian occupation and freed by the Ukrainian defence forces, the commanding hour is now on its way!
In the area of these cities and villages, restrictions will be in effect from 9 a.m. on April 2 to April 6 a.m. on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the raid, it is strictly forbidden at this time to be on the streets of localities and other public places, to travel and to walk.
Residents can only enter the street during an alarm signal to get into hiding.
Such restrictions are imposed to eliminate the effects of Russian aggression — cleanse and change areas.
The Omeljanyak called on people who had left these areas for the time being to refrain from returning home.
At the end of Kiev, the commanding hour will last from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day.

Over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the updating of military technology, and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places on the list of the world’s most powerful military states.
After the full - scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the Western countries took the prediction of a possible escalation in the Balkans very seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

Lucaschenka’s regime has delayed three whiterows, 27 and 28 years, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of a signal installation under the Osipovich, which provides for the movement of railway trains.
Source: Swaboda Joy, Wiasna Law Defense Center, Head of the MAF Criminal Police, Gennady Kasakevich, quoted by Belta.
In the MIF of Belarus, it was reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobrouisk had been detained for force support by SOD.
According to the "Embark" report, in the delay, the men were actively resisting and trying to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical institution.
Others were provided with on-site medical care.
The head of the criminal police of the MAF, Bilorussia Gennady Kasakevich, stated that “the acts of terror on the RB railway would be severely stopped” by the armed forces.
On April 6, it was reported that, on March 30, the police detained another Belarusian railway colleague, a fellow Baranovic section of the BDZ and the administration of the BDZ topical resources in Vkontakte and Valentin Samasyuk's Single Owners.
Where he is now and where he is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
By the end of March, at least 40 railways were delayed for sabotage in Belarus.
Remember, the formation of the BYpol, declared by the Lukashenka regime to be extremist, continues to call on the Belarusians to sabotage railway and Belarus infrastructure in the Peramoga plan.
The Belarusian protagonists are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As we know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is moving its life force and technology into Ukraine to fight.

The US bans investments in the Russian Federation and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters.
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, has introduced new sanctions against the daughters of the Russian President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Federation, the Alpha Bank, and the Sierra Bank, and has banned all new investments in Russia.
This is reported on the White House website.
Silverbank is Russia’s largest financial institution, owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets that apply to the US financial system and ban US citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will impose a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
For this purpose, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investment in Russia by US citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on an approved decision by over 600 multinational companies to leave Russia.
The exit of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers, such as legal and consulting companies,” is in White House’s declaration.
A third step in the new US sanctions has been restrictions on large Russian state enterprises in the critical sphere.
This would ban U.S. citizens from dealing with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
A detailed list of Minfin will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the total blocking of the assets of the adult children of Putin, the wife and daughter of the Foreign Minister of Lavrov, as well as members of the Security Council of Russia, including the ex-President and Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev and Prime Minister Michael Mishustin.
Sanctions disable them from the US financial system and freeze all assets they own in the United States.
You can only get to this place, the rest of the drive is closed, and I'll come to you.
Vira, can we wash the dishes in the car already?
My name is Olga, and before the war, I worked as a flight attendant for SkyAp, my mother was an industrial sewer, my son Macarczyk went to the gardens.
We lived beautifully, but we did not even think that we would be forced to flee because we were no longer able to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we have the hope that someone will take us home for the first time) We can even pay for a room or a flat, but if it's in our pocket.
Cleanliness and order are guaranteed.
We have no harmful habits.
Let us be grateful for such help at such a time that is not easy for us.
After lunch, I had a lecture in English and then went to work in the children’s room.
There I explained to Margarity how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understands and does everything well.
Also, I met Mrs. Lena and she and I talked about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an announcement from the pool.
It's a free swim.
You can call the school, Kira doesn't pick up her phone, doesn't answer, I don't know if she got to school.
They isolate the Russian office: stop investments and stop supplies.
However, we did not understand.
We didn't have any military in our house.
Our home is near a military unit and naphtobasa
He just helped me because I couldn't do it on my own.
I cook well, I don't ask too much, and I give good advice
I'm doing my best.
I'm having a little trouble, but I know I have to go through this phase.
I'll meet you at Thursday and tell you everything.
Everything's fine.
How often do you clean up?
I clean up every week.
I'm sorry I don't have a program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I Dreamed to Be a Teacher
My girls can't move anywhere right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you if you'd listen to information for your living, you'd let me know.
I'd love to rent a place with a decent girl.
If you can know that, let me know.
On my part, I won't let you down.
Thank you early.
Hasn't written you another person to Natalie for 54 years. Please write an exact address and how much the course costs.
I think you better make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I haven't changed my name, it's one since I was born :)
Mr. Reyard, I'm sorry I didn't see it, I'll do it right now and I'll send it to you right away.
We're going to a medical commission right now.
I mean, we're gonna have to work this hour on another day.
What day would she be better off coming early?
I'll hear you tomorrow, the Internet's not working well.
You're lucky what you're gonna do.
Thank you... for finding something out of the stuff, but there was nothing out of the technique...
Both beginners, except the abbreviation, are not aware of anything
Nothing's going on.
Can we do it on Monday, 25.04?
Kids can be taken with them, toys enough here:)
I guessed about Dad.
I may be very naive or very in love, but I will come up with this money.
We'll do it somehow.
But how this will be paid, please, no loans.
Text me straight, and I'll help.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Should we take those clothes with us?
It's not my day. The blinds broke in the living room. One morning.
Something came from you, I can't see
I'm very sad too.
I'll remind you of the fact later.
Is it just your dad who talks and understands Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to clean a house, and how many windows does a house have?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can't help but share with you.
Raju to read Joe Dispense, he's doing scientific research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neural connections.
Natalia Nagorna, a 1+1 television journalist, released a video on April 12, morning, which was handed over to her by the 36th Marine Military Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the army says that there were no weapons left in them to fight, and a mountain of wounded people.
They said "the count goes for an hour."
Prior to that, April 11, 36th, a separate Marine Brigade involved in the defence of Mariupol published an address to the Ukrainians in Russian.
It was said that April 11 could be the last fight for Mariupol's supporters, and the Ukrainian military command had not been linked to the fighters for two weeks.
In the social media, scepticism was expressed that the application was published in Russian.
The Chief Commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valerius Valérie, has assured us that the command of the defence forces in Mariupol is connected, and the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters in the Azovstal factory in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of Azova, Andrey Biletski, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal factory, which is holding the fighters of the Azov regiment.
Thank you, I'll fix it for you.
The situation is the same as we're still here.
Two hours of driving ) walks, Mom shopping and back!)
It's not important to the right.
She forgot what she was gonna do here.
The Chechen drone squadron has now begun flying over Ukraine.
Almost 50 professional coppers will serve to detect, and some of them will serve to directly destroy the enemy invader.
Two Zakarpatian brothers and two Czech “birds” were sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday, thanks to Mukachev’s deputy in the town of Volodymyr Lubutenka.
Today, however, their inter-Girl friends led by the village council leader and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Wasil Schur delivered drones for assignment: they were given special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where fighting is ongoing.
For the most efficient and safe use of coppers, where they are located, we'll leave them in secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop at what they have done, say that in the nearest days, many more interesting “gifts ” will be sent to Ukraine to serve the destruction of the Russian occupier and the preservation of the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I don't care, it's okay, I love sweet, but I can do it without it.
I'm worried we won't make it.
I'm going back to Ukraine soon, and I'm going to keep working.
Okay, if it's okay, I'll take it.
I'll try to do it myself, but if there's any confusion, I'll text you, if I may?
The main thing is that we understand each other.
We were personally in the lady of old age in the village of Eve, she saw me and that I was pregnant, but she said there was no housing.
Maybe she'll be happy and get her mood up.
My phone was repaired today.
And I think I'm still cold on the street today.
I've had medicine and tea, and I feel worse, but I'm not critical.
I'm also sorry, but I'd rather meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, throw me the music you like.
I'm interested in what you've got to do with music.
Mom and Dad Should Be Obeyed
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
It's been colder and rainier today.
But it's not a pity the houses have been destroyed, the people who are being bullied by the occupiers.
In Herson, the occupiers were bullied by the memorial of "Slave Ukraine" in Herson on the street of Perekopsky.
Details: It is noted that unknowns have torn the flag of the European Union, shredded panels with pictures of the Celestial Hundred and killed in the Russian-Ukrainian War.
The occupiers ripped off the portraits of the heroes of the Celestial Hundred and the dead in the Russian-Ukrainian War.
The flag's down.
Good morning, thanks to the kids for the cart, we don't have that custom, so we didn't know, we gave the kids only chocolate and cookies, maybe there was something else we needed to give.
There's someone in Czech to talk to.
'Cause I'm kind of living in a house up to 12 people will be here, and then they'll go to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
I've been to the crèche today.
Even today, I've been sleeping there.
So we are making great progress.
I'm sure I'll bring the cookies another time!
I don't have the strength to make them today.
Since I am being pushed away from the days and the time when there is work to clean apartments after guests, I can say something about April of the month because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
For the month of May, I can say about it at the end of April or at the beginning of May.
I just asked if you were talking about it.
Hey, I'm sorry I didn't make dinner and I slept a little.
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
Or we'll meet after you've arrived.
He's a modest, recent student, and he's got a lot to learn, and he's got a lot to do with it.
( Hi) Things went very well.
I was a little shocked that I was working with people in such a high position.
Today I learned a lesson from a lady who is the director of the Economics Department of the Highlands.
She was very pleased with my work.
Grisko in the crèche was doing well.
On Monday, I have to bring you a job confirmation and a cash payment for the crèche.
I'm on my way to Friday.
I don't do anything but do a lot of them and sleep.
If he goes to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you, if I may.
I have to deliver another analysis.
You don't have to go again.
There's a very bad drilling tank, a bad washing, and a master needs to be set up.
That's all there is.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I'd like to send you an invitation to a course in the Czech language you have signed up for.
And the children are fed there, or should they be brought with them?
And now for a moment, there's one question I can ask you.
If you need any more help, write
If I'm not wrong, you're celebrating Easter tonight, right?
From the beginning, we didn't really want you to raise money, so people didn't think we were hot on it!
But I didn't have two points to fill out online:
I'm going to lie down, get some energy, get some energy, and thank you for today's gift.
I'm going to see the video, it's going to be good because the whole family is going to draw.
The University of Carazine urges employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in mesengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Focus only on official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother who stayed in the Ukraine is also helping the army.
I got a few jobs for the portfolio.
After the holidays, we'll have an Internet.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How I'm going to get the day I wasn't at work is a rendition
Staff Summary: Russia prepares a provocation in Transdinaster to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transdinastrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against the neighbouring state."
It is true that “the armed forces of the Russian Federation are not excluded from provocation activities in the territory of the Predinastrian Region of the Republic of Moldova with a view to accusing Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring State.”
Details: The adversary continues to form an offensive group of troops to operate in the Slothosian direction.
Perhaps in the nearest days, the occupiers will try to regain the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and dispatch a special contingent, weapons, and equipment to participate in combat activities in Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being prepared at the location of the 60th single Motor-Sniper Brigade (Monastery) of the 5th General Army of the Eastern Military Region.
It is likely that the weapons will be transferred to the temporarily occupied area of the Donetsk region.
Also, in order to restore the loss of the special unit of the Battalion tactical group of the 36th separate Motor-Sniper Brigade (Borgia, Zabaykal province), 29 general army units of the Eastern Military Region are recruiting military officers from the designated brigade.
The enemy has a particular problem when recruiting drivers and driver mechanics.
The selection of the selected unit from the permanent location is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the opponent, to disrupt the supply of trucks to combat sites, will continue to strike the transport infrastructure in Ukrainian territory for the purpose of destroying or derailing them.
The designated subdivisions of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out the tasks of strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian-Blorussian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
On the Slohotian side, separate subdivisions of the 6th General Army and the North Coast Forces continue to block part of the city of Harkov, and continue to fire artillery fires on individual areas of the city.
On the Isosian direction, aerial reconnaissance is ongoing with a view to detecting the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
That's what the adversary uses with the Eagle 10 drone.
The enemy tried to strike in the direction of the towns of Longenke and Dimitrovka by force of two Battalion tactical groups, without success, and went to pre-occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the opponent continues to focus on taking control of the population of Popasna, Rubizna, Lower, and Novobakhmutka, as well as placing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out attacks in the Golden Area, and it was not successful.
In the city of Mariupol, the occupiers continue to storm the Azovstal plant and the seaport with artillery and aviation.
The enemy fired artillery fire on Ukrainian military positions in the areas of Viscopill, Trubelovka and Marijansk by forces of individual subdivisions.
In the Donetsk and Lugansk regions, Ukraine's protectors had four enemy attacks in the past days, five tanks, eight units of armoured vehicles, six units of vehicle technology, and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Don't you understand what you're thinking?
We'll usually try to make it, but I doubt it.
How can you sleep and I'll hold you up?
You sure you don't mind me coming over?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, so tell me, I'll understand.
We didn't watch TV at home, and we don't have to set up :)
I'm going to turn on the TV just to listen to the language of the Czech.
I'm running out of a month's tariff today :)
Can we do that on the phone today?
Buy tissue for embroidery, canvas, threads for embroidery
I understand that I can prepare the material in this field.
I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she's giving us so much pie.
I'll meet my father later, I'll be sure to.
I've read the facebook statement, so Google must have written something from his own.
Good afternoon, we're the things you brought, but there are things that we're small can bring you in 10 minutes?
I was thinking about the job.
If Mr. Director does, I can start work next week because I'm planning to go to the office tomorrow afternoon to file papers (if you get very big queues) and on Saturday rain:
I'm looking for a team at the beginning, and I really liked chemistry at school, learning Czech to know perfectly, dreaming of working in Teva.
Friends of old and not so much, friends I don't know personally, friends of spirit and mind.
Now you too have had difficult times.
During the last month, I was in touch with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned from foot to head, as has the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have confessed to being guilty and ashamed by your country's actions towards your neighbors.
Because they're giving up Ukraine in your name.
Some of you activists have been under threat for a long time, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
Early in March, I wrote Alexander Čerkasov, a very old friend of Memorial.
Let’s talk later, ” as usual briefly replied Sasha. “ Now, after we have searched, we walk through the ruins.
Others — artists, artists, critics, writers — are impressed by the sudden collapse of your tiny world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: with the exception of a very few of you -- those who worked in Memorial, in New Newspaper, in Echo Moscow, in Medusa, in Navall and in a few other places -- have many of you done anything to oppose this regime?
Except for participating in the rallies when they were still taking place.
Also read the column of the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, it's too late to keep quiet"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is more than an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your continued indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive association, which may now be a heavy burden on your soul and heart?
That was not always the case.
In 1990 there was a short period when you had to a certain extent a freedom and democracy – even a bloodthirsty but real one.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why, every time you finally have a revolution, do you finally have such a deep fear of grief that you seek salvation behind the king's back, may his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still feel safer around him.
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of grabbing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans in the stamp did, you took your soul to the monument of Dzerzynski – and allowed the KGB to lay low, refresh, reform and take over the country.
When you were chosen between the looting of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option — and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and that marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
Survival was a major concern.
Then there was Putin, young, entrepreneurial, aggressive, and he promised to deal with the terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you fell for it, but either you voted for it or you preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to compare Chechnya with the land again, most of you were blindfolded.
I remember well those years.
It was then that I worked in Chechnya, helping the victims of the Putinian "antiteroristic operation," and with my eyes I saw the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors that I witnessed: the torture of peaceful people, the killing of children, the soldiers who sold the bodies to their families.
You said to me, "We're sick of your Chechnya." I remember that very well.
In response, I resented, "Friends, this isn't my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your fucking country, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your authority that bombes one of your cities, kills your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise in the middle of zero, caused by the rising oil prices and the willingness of Putin to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money would remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have made good money, some have been rich, and even the poorest of you have bought a new home and found a better job.
The price's up, but what's wrong?
Moscow was shining and shining from its neck.
When several opponents were killed – Yuri Kikkochikin, Anna Politkovska, Alexander Litwinenka, and others – many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what had happened.
However, there was no further matter.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of President Medvedev and sat down as Prime Minister, I see you're barely paying attention to it.
When Medvedev Russia invaded Georgia after several months of rule, most of you ignored or silenced it.
How many of you have I met in the next years on the mountain slopes of Goodauri, in the outskirts of Casbej or in the cafeterias and in the Turkish tulips of Tbilisi, while a part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit, I don't think we've done much in the West, if we've done anything at all.
A little resentment, a little sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia’s flagrant violation of international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and domestic markets was so great?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the hard 1990s, that was the most important thing.
But at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, did wake up.
When Putin changed places again with Medvedev and sat down the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you were mass protesting.
The name Navalny became pronouncing, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt horrified that it was losing soil under its feet.
He then struck back.
At first, alternative action was organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands are behind bars.
Some have received enormous terms.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"It's so strong, and we're so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Disturbed by the pro-Russian president, who deceived their European expectations, they once seized Maidan – and never left him again.
They completely built a tent town on their own and prepared themselves for decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings, and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went into attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovic became the fugitive, and the Ukrainians returned democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and to expel them if they were doing their job badly.
Maydan was very displeased with Putin.
That was a bad example.
So, using the general confusion, he took the Krem.
Some of you were against it, but the benefits are few.
How many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91 percent of Russian citizens supported anecsia.
Suddenly, there was a new myth, and many of you, who despised Putin and his gang, suddenly returned 180 degrees and adored him.
I find it difficult to find a reason because immediately after that, we stopped talking.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you hid yourself in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, as new after the restoration, which was started by Moscow in 2012, with their bingoes, the popular wifi and the hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's just getting better.
You've drawn close attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, weren't there?
IDILE or whatever... even the Moscow editor who released my book about Syria criticized it in an interview then, because I had little idea of what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I was driving there and I saw government snipers shooting cold-blooded at my children's peers on the streets of Homs.
Among all Russian citizens there were only your soldiers, who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of pastor Martin Niemeller:
"At first, they came through the socialists, but I said nothing because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came to the tradesmen, but I was silent because I wasn't a professional.
Then they came after the Jews, but I was silent because I was not a Jew.
Then they came after me, but there was no one left to say anything to protect me."
How many of you have spoken of Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the majority of them said nothing.
Some really say now – such as Dmitro Glukhovsky, Mikhailo Shishkin, Michael Zigar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most people allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the interior of the country, like Marina Ovalnikov, risking entering the new GULA or putting together a company called Nawalny.
As for others, you know best where you live.
So I'm sure you understand that when Putin's dealing with the Ukrainians – or what seems very likely if he doesn't, he'll take your favor.
For all of you, my friends, for those who courageously, but mostly alone, have protested, and have so far been insignificant, but will soon get more serious.
For thousands of you who have signed petitions, who have expressed dissent in social media (even in the black square in Instagram) or who have spoken in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of disfellowshipping were given simply for anecdotes have not been in such a distant past – and now they are very likely to wait for you in the future.
Who will speak for you, who will remain?
The example of the Ukrainians – even more than 2014 – frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that mind, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how depressing his advantage is on the paper.
In view of everything, few in Russia are aware of this, as is the fact that war is going on.
But you, my friends, know exactly what's going on.
You read news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you communicate.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be alert.
You know what this is all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence came to an end.
Your choices are just jokes, your laws, if you don't mind the repressive ones, cost no more than the paper they're on, your last free media are gone, your economy is going to collapse faster than I'm writing, you don't have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if there's still some flights left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence; he will demand your agreement, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to go or you'll get crushed.
I doubt you can see another option.
Still, there's another one left.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And maybe under the conditions you're in, you're going to need less than you think.
Think about it.
It's not from you: because of the economic collapse that's taking place in Russia, it's likely to burn in the provinces, in small cities.
When prices go up and wages are not paid, those people who have voted for Putin for all these years, wanting bread and peace, will go out on the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, or you, my friends.
But if each city goes to the rally by itself, as it has done on a periodic basis, it will not be difficult for it to stifle them alone.
There is a need for organization and coordination. The crowd will have to be converted into mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool -- an Internet that can limit the regime, but that still works and that can be set up under almost any circumstances.
Navalny’s organization has been defeated, but other, more informal, more decentralized, can be created.
There's a lot of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly hundreds of thousands.
If more than 300,000 comes out, it'll be stunned.
The army will have to use it, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to it?
After all, what did he force them to do in Ukraine, all that he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will experience a perceived fear; but those who have children will fear for them.
And that's natural, that's normal.
I'd be afraid if I were you, too.
In Syria, and now in Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happened to those who dared to ignore their master, who dared not only to demand freedom but really tried to obtain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost for nothing.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat game – and he will be arrested; your daughter will express resentment on the Internet – and he will be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes – and die in a gray cell under police batons.
That's what's been going on for many years – and it's only going to get bigger and bigger.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know what's gonna happen.
Act in cold blood, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were at class on Friday, and they told us we could come on Monday.
We'll be home tonight.
That you see me as a secretary's press
Vico, how often do you go to a fancy restaurant for dinner?
Once on my mouth, I go to dinner at a fancy restaurant.
I'll try to explain it to her.
So we liked it very nice and we wanted something better because it's a better option.
I was in a room where there were a lot of people.
I don't feel well, coughing, temperature, voice loss, weakness and head spinning.
I have to go to that government of work.
We've already done it, but they said who registered in April half the money only at the end of the month.
On Thursday, we need a break, we'll go with the kids to the doctor.
But at night, I was texted by a lady who liked your work, and she would want something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for new news from her, and I'm sure I'll let her know.
When I was working in the procurator, I thought I was going to build a career, I wasted a lot of time and energy.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, mental work that I was completely disappointed in.
It's a shame to lose time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am communistic, but I am serious about love and marriage.
There was one man I had to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I think people have to love, respect, trust each other in order to create a family.
Now, I haven't seen one of those.
Good day, where can you get a form in Yevela to bake a bag (paper or silicon)?
All right, thanks for the advice, then I'm going to put a statement on Valya.
She's got a DCP in her bed, now she's got a broken foot in her hips, a wheelchair in her bed, all the food is wiping in a blender.
Mr. Reyhardt, I'm sorry I'm bothering you at a bad time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to Natalie's playroom today, to say hello to her.
She was in a bad situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the baby away because she said she came to look at things and put them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valery opened up our children's room yesterday until 7:00.
Can that really be the case?
It's working time for the room before 4:00.
Finally, it is our responsibility.
But I don't have to load it. It doesn't open a very weak Internet.
Good afternoon, we're good.) Kola's working, they filled out the invitations last night, and I was studying with the elders before my exam at the gymnasium.

What do I have to do?
To contact the principal of the school with this question?
