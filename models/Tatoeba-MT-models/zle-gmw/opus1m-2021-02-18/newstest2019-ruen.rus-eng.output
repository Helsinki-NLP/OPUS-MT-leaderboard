Number of new recruits preparing to be sent to Donbas from Ukraine
Andrei Marocko, an official of the self-proclaimed Lugano People ' s Republic (LPR), stated that Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbass in the winter of 2018-2019.
According to him, Kyiv is planning “to do something to complete the units”.
“The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian military, mass dismissals have led to a low number of units”, said Marocko, quoted by RIA News.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians recruited into the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kyiv launched a so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by a Joint Forces (JFOR) operation.
This measure was intended to strengthen the role of Ukrainian Silovists in the resolution of the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbassa was aggravated by the murder of the head of the DND, Alexander Zaharchenko.
The DNR authorities have described what happened as a terrorist attack.
Several persons involved in the explosion were detained during the criminal investigation.
According to preliminary information, they confirmed that the Ukrainian intelligence services had sabotaged it.
The U.S. authorities forced Mask to resign from the presidency of Tesla
An American businessman, Ilon Musk, will resign as chairman of the board of directors of Tesla's company at the request of the U.S. authorities.
In order to settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman will also pay $20 million to settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission.
According to CNBC, the pre-trial arrangement with the agency allows Mask to remain in the leadership position at Tesla.
In doing so, he is required to pay $20 million and leave the office of chairman of the board of directors within 45 days of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed.
It is clarified that the agreement has yet to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it was reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Mask of misleading shareholders by claiming sufficient funds to buy the company’s shares and suing the entrepreneur.
It's about a businessman tweeting, where he claimed he wanted to buy Tesla shares for $420 a piece, but he never did.
After the tweet, the company's shares grew by almost 11%.
The head of the British MIDA compared the EU to the Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the EU with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of captivity to the member countries of the community.
The diplomat made this statement at the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, 30 September.
According to Daily Mail, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is obvious: if you turn the EU from a community to a prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who will want to escape from captivity,” said the Minister.
He added that trying to punish Britain for its decision to withdraw from the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, noting Gaceta.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Teresa May announced that the Brexit talks had reached a stalemate.
So she commented on the outcome of the EU informal summit in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was taken in 2016 by referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will work together after London leaves the community.
In addition, the question of the Irish border remains open.

A gift was given in honour of the inter-Korean summit held from 18 to 20 September in Pyongyang.
The hunter phunsan from the North Korean wolves was named from a district in the DPRK.
According to the agency, Moon loves animals, he already has two of these dogs that the last North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, gave him.
Dogs aren't the only gift.
Kim Jong Eun also gave his colleague two tons of delicate matsutake mushrooms.
He ordered the distribution of these mushrooms to members of families separated during the Korean War who had not yet been reunited with their relatives from the DPRK.
The head of the Altai village council stopped the hunger strike in defence of the interests of the inhabitants
The deputy announced on his Facebook page that he had stopped starving for several reasons.
The head of the village council stated that the situation was deadlocked, that the district administration did not respond to his demands, and that he had to carry out his work.
In addition, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has begun to verify the situation, and the heating organization STCP has promised to start work on preparing the system for the winter heating period of the Siberian village next week.
The people of the village council also drafted and removed to the Governor of the Altai region a mass collective treatment “in relation to the current catastrophic situation”.
Boronin himself reported that he was feeling well, and he was fully responsible for his duties as head during the hunger strike.
As Boronin explained, the towns of Siberia and Rogulica have centralized heating systems, and therefore the authority to prepare them for winter must be exercised by the administration of the Pervomaysky region.
To date, however, no one has started the work.
The head of the village council also protested against the lack of proper control and support by the Altay province Government and against the financial policy of Gazprominter-Regionalgas Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper preparation of the villages for the winter, Boronin demanded “the immediate establishment of a full-fledged and autonomous communal area with appropriate staff units in the municipality”.
Named Moscow's new buildings with the cheapest apartments

Telegram users complained about a malfunction in the new version
The iPhone users complained about problems in the Telegram messaging after the update of September 28.
The user's phone number can be obtained from the user's username
The complaints concern gadgets with the current iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, when updated, the application displays a white screen or closes it immediately.
Messinger's representatives reacted to a malfunction.
They said that the problem could be related to the migration of information to a new application written in Swift.
In Telegram, the automatic update of the application was temporarily suspended until the bugs were resolved.
On 13 April, the Tagan Court of Moscow granted Roskomnadzor's claim to block Messinger Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, the communication operators proceeded to implement the decision.
The reason was the misender administration ' s refusal to provide the FSB with the key to decrypting the correspondence needed to obtain terrorist data.
In August, Telegram changed the policy of confidentiality and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of the suspected terrorist user when a court decision was received.
Telegram has decreased by 1.2 million since the blockage in the Russian Federation.
I'm glad for the guys who went out to realize the numerical advantage in a game with the Minsk Dinamo.
I'm glad for the guys who went out to realize the numerical advantage in a game with the Minsk Dinamo.
Bob Hartley, chief coach of the Avangarde, summed up the results of the regular KHL championship against the Minsk Dinamo (2:1).
A very important victory for us.
After the St. Petersburg match, we held a meeting and agreed that we should leave the game behind and prepare for Minsk.
We knew that Dinamo had a good victory before we met, so we were very serious about it.
It was important to drop in most, I'm happy for the guys who went out to realize the numerical advantage.
We've been playing pretty well in most of the time lately, but we couldn't score.
At last, the red light was lit outside the gate.
We knew Minsk was going to be loaded for the game, he'd try, and that's what happened.
The game in most became a determining goal, and the winning goal we scored was in unequal composition.
We were able to have a good third period today, despite the fact that we missed the early goal in this segment and it was clear that it would not be easy in the future.
But we played very well in defense, we didn't give a lot of chances to our rival, we didn't let them catch us on shifts, Dinamo didn't have a number of attacks, so it ended well for us, and that's what Hartley's press club said.

Ilon Musk is forced to resign as head of the Board of Directors of Tesla
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the founder of Tesla Ilon Musk settled their fraud dispute.
CNBC News reports this.
According to the television channel, Mask will have to resign as head of the Board of Directors of Tesla as part of the agreements reached.
At the same time, the commission allowed Mask to retain the post of Tesla leader.
It is noted that the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount will be collected from Tesla.
The money is distributed to affected investors.
In addition, the company is required to appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Musk is an American entrepreneur on the list of the 50 richest people on the planet, according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the SpaceX Space Corporation, the neuro-psychological company Neuralink, and the developer of Tesla electric cars, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission had previously sued the CEO of Tesla Ilon Mask because of his tweet message about a possible buyout of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy out all stock on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The price of $420 was allegedly “because of the importance of this number in marijuana culture”, previously reported by Bloomberg, referring to Stephen Paykin's co-director of the security department of the Commission.
At the same time, Ilon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy the shares.
Commenting on the US Securities and Exchange Commission's lawsuit against him, the businessman stated that he considered the allegations of fraud to be unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
"Truth is the most important thing in my life, and the facts will prove that I didn't break it in any way," said a businessman in an interview with CNBC.
However, in August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective suit against the Mask, complaining about financial losses suffered.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had caused them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders claimed that the tweets of the businessman were misleading, forcing Tesla stock sellers to purchase papers at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that the reckless statements of Ilon Mask led to sharp exchange rate fluctuations.
In September, Ilona Musk was accused of exchange fraud by the head of the Citron Research research company.
In the meantime, if Musk had not been able to settle his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would have been at risk of being suspended and even imprisoned.
In particular, CNBC's former chairman, Harvey Pitt, claimed this.
Mask is "a good guy who can't run a car company."

The RPT compared the possible renaming of the CPI with the actions of the Fascists
The head of the Division of External Church Relations (OCTS) of the Moscow Patriarchate of the Mitropolitan Volocolam Ilarion compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Nazis in Germany.
Mitropolitan Volocolam Ilarion - about the causes of the conflict with the Constantinople Patriarchate, possible church division and its political connotation
According to him, now that “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at an acute stage”, changing the name of the church is as if in fascist Germany, “Jews wear a yellow six-end star”.
"It means labeling the church as an enemy organization, and for that purpose the bill was created," said the RPT representative on the TV channel Russia 24.
Mitropolitan also stressed that the UCP is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian church, because “the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country”.
The UCP called on the Constantinople Exarchs to leave its territory

As a result of our meeting with automakers, it is in the foreseeable future that the creation of the Russian Formula One, which has no equivalent in the world, is what Dmitri Kozak said.
We must encourage our car manufacturers in this direction.
It was about plans until 2024, but I don't think it's possible in that time frame.
I think a more realistic time frame is within the next ten years."
From 2012 to 2014, the Marsh team performed under the Russian licence in Formula One.
According to the vice-premier, there are already investors who are willing to invest in the formation of a national team in the World Auto races in the Formula One class.
I know that in Russia there are car sports amateurs, wealthy businessmen who are willing to invest, willing to invest in the creation of the Russian team of Formula One, he noted.
"We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like this.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team has come up, including because of the infrastructure in Sochi."
The Sochi Autodrome is waiting tomorrow for the party.
According to Dmitri Kozak, the organizers were able to sell all 50,000 tickets.
Look, even at the qualifications of the rostrum, it was almost complete, noted the vice-premier.
I can tell you that this year's revenue went up by 72 percent compared to last year.
It's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the utilization of Sochi Autodrome infrastructure throughout the year.
It will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitri Kozak and the main theme of the day for Russian auto-sporters was the return of Daniel Quyat to the Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel together and wish him success next season, the vice-premier said to the news.
He's a very hopeful racer.
Next year, for the first time in history, two major Russian pilots will be able to take part in the Formula 1 pelotone.
Although Sergey Orotkin's future in the Royal Races remains unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not as yet impressive: he took 18th place in Russia's Grand Prix.
Let's hope next season there will be more of our main pilots than this year, says Dmitri Kozak.

On September 30, 1928, exactly 90 years ago, British bacteria Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of an era of modern antibiotics, brought global glory to Fleming, and made him a Nobel laureate.
By the way, the selection of penicillin from mold mushrooms wasn't Fleming's first discovery.
A few years earlier, when he had a cold, he had sown a slime from his own nose into a Petri cup (a glass lid in which bacteria were tested) and a few days later, he discovered that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
They found penicillin in almost the same way.
Fleming's name was added to the list of the 100 most outstanding individuals in human history.
Its discovery, according to many scientists, changed the course of history.
With penicillin, medicine began to deal with most of the oldest diseases previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945 shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, the Paris newspapers wrote, "For the defeat of fascism and the liberation of France, he did more than dozens of divisions."
Experts estimate that Fleming’s discovery of the world’s first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million people.
Alexander Fleming died in his home in London in 1955 from a heart attack.

Where, by the way, my wife and I noticed this from a speechful Russian tour guide.
And a few years later, the statue of Alexander Fleming, in full growth, was seen in the most unexpected place in Spain’s capital.
There, near the main arena for the Corrida Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to a man whose efforts they thought had been to save the lives of hundreds of outstanding artisans of the Corrida.
By the way, this very interesting porcelain work I think was found there in Madrid, but at a different time and not at all.

He spoke about this in a speech to his supporters in West Virginia, transmitting CNN.
I was tough, and so was he, and we walked forward and backwards, and then we fell in love with each other.
He wrote me beautiful letters, great letters," said the Head of State, jokingly noting that the media would again misinterpret his words and call them "non-presidential."
"Trump said they fell in love, how terrible," he mocked the press.
The American leader denied that he had abandoned the issue of the removal from the DPRK of the remains of American soldiers and the release of prisoners.
"I didn't throw anything," stressed the President.

The Hollywood star Gwyneth Paltrow ("The Iron Man", "The Shakespeare Loved") married producer Brad Falczak.
Although the rumours of their wedding had been going on since April, the couple officially concluded only now, on 29 September.
According to People magazine, a private ceremony took place at Paltrow's house on Long Island.
Three tents had been installed on her property, one directly married, the other catering, and the third for service personnel.
Among the guests were director Stephen Spielberg (Criminal Guinet), film stars Cameron Diaz, Robert Downey Jr., Liv Tyler, and others.
Paltrow, who was 46 years old on 27 September, met with 47-year-old Brad for three years before he announced his engagement in January this year.
She calls him "the man who was destined for her destiny."
She was previously married to British musician Chris Martin, the leader of Coldplay.
In this marriage, she gave birth to two children: Apple's daughter is 14 years old, Moses' son is 12.
In 2015, the couple filed for divorce.
Gwyneth and Chris didn't have a big celebration in 2003.

Brad was married to a television producer, Suzanne Buchinik, for ten years.
He also has two children from this marriage.

Google will pay Apple $9 billion for default searcher status
The U.S. Google company will pay $9 billion to remain the default search engine in the Apple Safari browser.
According to Business Insider, payments will increase to $12 billion next year.
Last year, Google paid $3 billion for this option.
It is noted that the annual fee is calculated on the basis of how many Google search calls were made from Siri's voice assistant and the Safari browser on iOS devices.
According to analysts, Google does not benefit from abandoning the default search engine status because Apple is one of the largest sources of traffic for the search engine.
In early August, Apple became the first American company to capitalize at $1 trillion.
The previously published accounts show that the corporate net profits in the third quarter increased by 32 per cent compared to the same period in 2017, reaching $11.5 billion.

In addition, Rubicon expressed solidarity with thousands of prisoners in United States prisons struggling with the U.S. system.
Previously, members of the group had entered various organizations, ministries and embassies more than a hundred times, with impunity.
Anarchists raided Iranian, Israeli, Austrian and Saudi embassies.
They were able to seize the Spanish Embassy and to destroy the office of the British non-governmental organization Oxfam, which, in the opinion of Rubicón, was involved in a paedophilia scandal.

Trump told me about "love" in Kim Jong-un.
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea almost got in love with each other, Donald Trump made a joke.
U.S. President Donald Trump made a good joke about his success on the frontline of a resolution of the North Korean crisis.
Beginning with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now remedied their relationship so much that they are almost in love with each other, noted the American President.
The owner of the White House recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main challenge in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama’s team had so started a relationship with the DPRK that they couldn’t even reach the country’s leadership that they simply didn’t take off their phone.
At the time, the US and the DPRK were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House "pretty letters," noted Trump.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, he was also cruel to Kim Jong Eun, which was mutual.
But now their relationship has been refreshed so much that the leaders are "in love with each other."
Trump said not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump noted that Pyongyang had recently ceased nuclear and missile testing and was closing military sites.
It's all the credit for his administration, I'm sure the American president.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump flattered Kim Jong Eun from the United Nations General Assembly rostrum.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
Trump noted, however, that sanctions against the DPRK would continue until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Negotiations in Singapore
On June 12, Singapore hosted the first-ever talks between US and North Korean leaders.
After a serious deterioration of relations and mutual threats of the use of nuclear weapons, the summit seemed to be a breakthrough in the protracted American-Korean crisis.
As a result of the negotiations, the parties had expressed their intention to move towards a peaceful resolution of the contradictions, although they had not made any legal commitments.
The positive outcome of the meeting was the cessation of the nuclear and missile tests of the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps towards denuclearization of North Korea are still bouncing.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the US had already sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangsters".

Nice called for the deletion of “Moscow language by Ukrainian product”
Ukrainian child writer and mother tongue purity fighter Laris Nice called for the removal of “Russian-language Moscow product and Moscow language” from Ukraine.
It offers to do so with a Ukrainian product - a “cultural wave, a cultural push”.
Nitza shared her views on the “advisability of eradicating Russian in Ukraine” with the Ukrainian publication The Observer.
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it is already eating and is continuing to develop further.
In time, the Ukrainians will recover from this "Moscow language", she's convinced.
In neighbouring Poland, for example, she said that Russian speech had been widely used on television and radio, but there was little public space left.
However, according to Nice, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language are, in her view, merely “expanding the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
In the past, Nice shared her experience of maintaining a “Ukrainian-speaking regime” in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court with a network of Watsons bookshops, one of which was contacted by a cashier in Russian.
Without getting what it was, Nice threw the change at the girl.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called "language schizophrenia", calling on Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in the writing of names.
Nice recently stated that the name "Rous" had been stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service could not avoid the anger of the writer: when she came there and heard the staff talk to each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left with the door.
During the break, we had a man’s conversation, and it worked.
"Urala" defender Denis Kulakov - about winning Arsenal (2:1) in the ninth round of the Russian championship.
"Denis, what do you think won?"
"I think we wanted to win more," quotes Kulakov's official website Urala.
"The game was so complicated, and there was a serious men's conversation during the break, and it had its results: they beat two balls and didn't miss it.
"You missed a few matches because of the damage you sustained at the beginning of the month.
How did it feel today?"
"If it lasted 90 minutes, then it's okay!
Actually, I felt good.
Maybe at the end a little bit of strength to make sure nothing happens.
So, the doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolijevich Gashhnev brought me to this game, for which I thank them very much!
"What do you think of the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after winnings, it's easier to recover, and the mood in the group is good.
Now we have a white stripe, though it was black at first.
We need to keep doing this and make the fans happy."
"Did you miss the game while you weren't on the field?"
"There's this, a little bored, because the really, really unpleasant situation has come out.
But again, thank you to the physiotherapist and the doctors for getting back on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and made the fans happy.
And the rest is secondary."

In a referendum in Macedonia, violations were recorded
Four incidents involving violations of electoral legislation were recorded in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on renaming.
This was reported on Sunday by the Spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, Tony Angelovsky.
Since the opening of polling stations, four incidents have been recorded and resolved, he said.
At the polling station at Lazo Angelovski Elementary School in Skopje, 22-year-old K.J. violated public order and tranquillity, insulted citizens and assaulted police officers.
He was detained and taken to the police station.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all violators were immediately taken to police stations.
The Ministry noted that all violations were being verified.
“The Ministry will act in accordance with the law to enable citizens to exercise their constitutional right freely to express their will.
We call upon citizens to respect the law and to refrain from any disturbance of public order and tranquillity and any violation of the secrecy of voting,” said the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
In the Sunday referendum, citizens are asked to answer one question: “Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?”
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek province.
On 17 June, the heads of the Macedonian and Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic at a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, which runs the border between the two countries.
It provides for the use of the name “Republic of Northern Macedonia”.
This treaty must resolve not only the multi-year dispute over the name of the country, but also open the way to NATO and the EU.
Head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Russia ' s decision to deliver C-300 is a timely step
Russia ' s decision to supply air defence systems (APCs) C-300 to Syria is a timely step.
This opinion was expressed by the head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Muallem, in an interview with the RT television channel, which aired on Sunday.
If we analyse the importance of protecting the Syrian sky, we will see that this is a sign of security and stability, not of war.
I want to say that this is a very timely step, and we are very grateful for Russia's efforts in this regard,” the Minister noted.
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that C-300 was a defensive system, not an offensive system, and was designed to protect the Syrian sky.
Pashinian hopes to hold early elections to the Parliament of Armenia in 2018
Elections to the Parliament of Armenia can take place as early as 2018, as stated by the Prime Minister of Armenia, Nicolas Pashinian.
“Perhaps before the end of the year”, the head of government replied to a question from journalists about the timing (interfax citation).

But I'm willing to negotiate with the parliamentary forces.
I hope they are also committed to constructive dialogue,” quotes the premiere of the “News Armenia”.
Nicolas Pashinian added that early elections were “the demand of the people”, as well as part of the Government's programme for which Parliament had voted.
The Government's long-term vision, he said, was also necessary to attract investment and economic development.
At the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr. Pashinian promised, upon his return to Yerevan, to begin “a discussion with representatives of all parliamentary and non-parliamentary forces to discuss the time and conditions of the early elections”.
In the current Parliament, about half of the deputies represent the opposition Mr. Pashinian Republican Party of Armenia (RPA).

The charges against the Dagestan deputy are news.
The Mahachkala Soviet District Court held for two months a deputy of the Dagestan People ' s Assembly, Rajab Abdoulatipov, suspected of involvement in a criminal association that constituted disability for bribery.
OS has become aware of the details of the investigation's material that shed light on how, according to the Russian Examining Committee, the younger brother of the former head of the republic, Ramazana Abdoulatip Rajab Abdoulatip, has now facilitated criminal action by the former head of the General Bureau of Medical and Social Investigation, Magomed Mahachev, and his accomplices.
Among other things, during the investigative and operational activities carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was found that Rajab Abdulatipov had lobbied Magomed Mahachev for the post of head of the Bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles.
In the past, the investigation of Magomed Mahačev, other leaders and members of the territorial medical and social expert offices under his jurisdiction was initiated under article 210 (establishment and participation in a criminal association using official status), article 290 (receipt of bribes by an organized group), article 292 (servatory fraud) and article 159 (special fraud) of the Criminal Code.
According to the investigation, in late 2013, Rajab Abdulatipov, aware of the illegal activities of Magomed Mahachev and his accomplices involved in theft of the Pension Fund, joined their activities by joining the criminal community.
While serving as Head of the Directorate of the Russian Federal Migration Service for Dagestan and having links in State authorities and law enforcement structures, as well as his relationship with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdoulatip, investigators consider that “he provided for the activities of other members of the criminal community, established contacts with officials of State bodies to support the illegal activities of Magomed Mahachev and his position as head of the federal penal institution “Chief Bureau of Medical and Social Investigation of the Republic of Dagestan”, organized the illegal identification of disability of citizens”.
Following the announcement of this information at a meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, everything I'm charged with today is new to me, I'm completely unfamiliar with it," he said.
The court did not arrest a member of the “One Russia” for 10 days before the indictment, as was the case with previous high-ranking Dagestan officials, but for two months at once, as article 210 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation appeared in his case.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much more time for the prosecution of an investigation, up to 45 days from the moment of arrest.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia was virtually absent.
The head of the Federation Council Committee for International Affairs, Constantine Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly to be a success for Russia, and does not rule out that it will be a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global problems.
“The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric that we have almost become accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been more depressing,” said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years the Russian Federation had sometimes “noted as one of the three major threats to humanity, but in addition to the Ebola fever, the Russian Federation was in this category, in any case, in the statement of a group of Western countries, which had expressed itself quite unanimously in this regard”.
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed that “the topic of Russia was virtually non-existent”.
“If I carefully analyse the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the German Foreign Minister, I am not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at any rate, the choir was not quite accurate,” he drew the attention of the politician, noting that Russia “was no longer a wall that was being trained by a tennis ball.”
The head of the Souveda substantive committee does not rule out that this indicates a trend that he believes “will separate the current session [of the United Nations], although this trend may manifest itself fully in a year, two, three”.
“I do not rule out that this session may in some sense be a turning point”, Kosachev admitted, explaining that “there are too many examples of how Russia can move forward with its involvement in international affairs.”
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
“Unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will be needed over time,” added the parliamentarian.
This is related to the fact that he believes that there is “an adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible — an integral part in solving the global problems of our time”.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have the feeling that we're going through a point somewhere where movement is no longer going backwards, it's going to be moving forward," he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context was described by Kosachev as “a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should evolve”.
“I have attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly session] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and I have met with great pleasure, and I have seen that if the Russian opinion, a year or two or five years ago, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, in large part, no one has asked, the situation is different,” said the Chairman of the Sovfed Committee.
In his view, this is because “the so-called new liberal order that represents the West has no answers to how to deal with the world's problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, lack of ideas on how to deal with the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problems of migration”.
“And here, the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more evident,” he expressed his confidence, stressing that in this sense he considers “the current session to be a good one for the Russian delegation to work well for Russia.”

In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that military force will not have to be used in the Syrian province of Idlib, said the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Muallem.
Syria, he said, was entitled to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly resolve the issue of the withdrawal of the fighters from the demilitarized zone in Idlib by the Russian-prohibited organization Jebhat al-Nusra, reports the RIA News.
The head of MIDA also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the territories east of Euphrates if the Kurds were to seek separatism.
At the same time, Muallem believed that the talks with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they were interrupted because of the US.
On 17 September, Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdoğan agreed to establish by 15 October a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and Government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry led the Chelsea Youth Team.
It was previously reported that a 37-year-old defence counsel had negotiated the transition to the Moscow Spartacus.
According to RT, with reference to Mirror, former captain John Terry of England led the Chelsea Youth Team.
According to the source, a well-known player who has long been a member of the London Club will lead the team at least 23 years of age.
It's noted that Terry's coaching staff will replace Jody Morris, who left for Durby County.
To recall, in September Terry was close to moving to Moscow Spartacus, but eventually abandoned the idea after talking to his family.
First Vice-Speaker of the Upper Rada, Irina Gerashchenko, apologized to the Russian convict for “spionage” by Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushchenko for failing to release him from the cells.
She said this in a video message to a political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko FSB.
She said that a campaign was taking place these days under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, in which participants protested with hunger and demanded the release of the prisoners of the Kremlin.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural leaders, among them, there are people who know you, who starve to support Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiation, no interview, wherever the President of Ukraine, Ukrainian power, all of us, have demanded pressure on the Kremlin, pressure on Putin with one demand: the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all the political prisoners of the Kremlin and those children illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbassa and Crimea,” said Gerashchenko.
She also expressed confidence that the tests would stab every Ukrainian, making us “more angry, harder to defend Ukraine's national interests, to protect every Ukrainian, to understand what is good and what is evil”.
Recall that the Ukrinform correspondent in France, Roman Sushchenko, was arrested by Russian silos on September 30, 2016 at Moscow airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with espionage against the General Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years of maximum security colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia found the verdict to be lawful.
Russian prison guards granted the last request of the Ukrainian before he was staged into the colony.
NASA reported an asteroid approaching Earth the size of Big Ben.
The American Space Agency NASA reported that a large asteroid SP1 was approaching the Earth, which could be as long as 160 m.
According to Daily Express, a space object may exceed the height of the famous Big Ben or the London wheel of view.
However, the exact size is not yet available.
The speed with which SP1 is moving is about 60,000 km/h. The smallest distance between the asteroid and Earth will be on October 3.
Then it will pass our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million km.
The asteroid was first spotted on September 19.
NASA listed it as near-Earth objects.
Earlier, on September 27, Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency published the first ever video from Rugu's asteroid surface.
Two Japanese rovers (planetic riders) launched from the Hayabusa-2 probe managed to extract unique images.
I've been told Baste's name is "Baste" for the football lawn of the FM-2018 Stadium.
The damage to the football lawn in the Rostov-on-Donu stadium was linked to a concert by Russian rapper Vasily Vakulenko, or Basta.
Photo published in Instagram account hd7tv.
"We're very good at Basta and his creativity, but... sorry for the lawn," says the signature to the photos.
The comments alleged that the protective coating (special tiles) caused damage to grass at the edge of the field.
The concert, scheduled for 29 September, was never cancelled.
The Rustov Football Club, as well as the Russian Premier League, opposed the concert.
"I want to know the names of those football players and Rostov representatives who claim that my performance could be detrimental, disrupting the activities and development of the football club, as well as influencing the performance of its players," Basta wrote in response to criticism.
Rostov Arena is one of the stadiums of the World Cup 2018.
It held five tournaments.

The agreement with the group of companies, Formula-1, provides for the Russian Grand Prix races to take place every year from 2014 to 2025.
"I couldn't even hold a spoon."
Vahtang Kikabidze for Cancer Control
Many artists now talk about how they managed to cope with oncology.
Unfortunately, the disease spares no one, and the stories of popular people about winning cancer give hope to many patients.
A famous actor, Wahtang Kikabidze, admitted that he was only alive because of his wife.
Years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
"It's like I've been hit with a hammer down my skull.
I fell.
Lost his orientation.
They put it in the hospital.
I couldn't hold the spoon, I couldn't stand there, I fell all the time.
They started doing tests, it turns out it's bad, the artery won't miss the blood.
They brought me to Moscow, and they said I had a big cyst in my head, and they had an emergency surgery.
And during the surgery, the doctors after the cyst saw a tumor," told Kikabidze in "One Day."
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the idol at his doorstep.
But the actor's wife wouldn't let a live actor be buried, and she believed that she would be able to cope with the disease and that she would not leave her beloved husband's bed for more than a year.
If it wasn't for Irina, I'd be dead right now.
Always when I had critical situations, she was there like a rock," the actor confessed.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, and now he lives happily in his home in mid-Tbilisi.
And from time to time, the rumours of his illness, and of the untimely death that ever happens on the Internet.
The creators of the Peacemaker site added Peter Siillarto to the “Purgatory” section of the Hungarian Foreign Minister.
The motive was “the attempt on Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
In addition, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the neighbouring country was found guilty of “direct threats of invasion of Ukraine” and “support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine”, as well as of participation “in the organization of provocation aimed at mass violations by Ukrainian citizens of Ukrainian law”.
Note that the viceroy of Kievo Pecher Lavra, Pavel, and the leader of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) Onufriy, have arrived in front of Siyarto in the Purity.
Their opposition to the acquisition of Tomos by the Ukrainian subsidiary church was the motive.
Earlier, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpatia, the President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, demanded respect for Ukraine ' s sovereign rights.
The authorities have named the sum of the gold parachute of the Vorones' super-gubernator.
The one-time payment of 23 salaries by Deputy Governor of Voronezhsk province, Yuri Agibalova, was made under the Regional Public Positions Act.
However, the real amount of the gold parachute released from the office of the vrio official was several times lower than the amount reported in the media.
Such explanations were provided by the regional government press service.
According to the law, the salary for the position of Agibalov is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, in the press service, the lump sum was 223,892 roubles less income tax, rather than the 1 million roubles reported by the media.
He received an old-age insurance pension from July 2018.
He has been in public office for more than nine years.
The pension and the lump sum are awarded immediately upon separation from office and explained to RIA News in the region's government.
At the same time, the payment of additional pension payments to Agibalov was suspended on appointment to the State and his salary remained unchanged from the previous period.
The winner of the Governor's election, Vrio of the Governor of the Region, Alexander Gusev, took office on 15 September.
Agibalova was dismissed on the expiry of the term of office of the head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public office in the region have ended.
On 29 September, Telegram Channel Nezigar published documents that showed that Agibalova, who had resigned from his position as vice-governor, had paid a termination indemnity of 23 salaries and, two days later, he had again received a similar post without a vrio.
The deputy of the State Duma called on students to be informed of the harm of masturbation.
Onishchenko holds the post of First Vice-Chairman of the Education and Science Committee.
On the basis of his experience, he noted in an interview that young people were provoking masturbation through harmful information they found on the Internet.
The fight against this is at the level of educational institutions and the family, and the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, MP of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with Radio Voice Moscow):
As part of the general sex education of children, this must be done to explain the harm caused by the risk of sexual health of the child, both boys and girls.
The problem is objective, it is that the children's maturity is early enough and there are large scissors between their puberty and the possibility of formal intersex contacts.
According to Onishchenko, the problem is hampered by “faithfulness”, the silence of “sexual age” and the lack of a culture of adequate child-rearing.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers face masturbation.
The deputy believes that teaching about the harm of masturbation is primarily found in schools in hyperurbanized regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, you and I will simply not understand, to put it mildly," said the professor.
Gennady Onishchenko is an active Academist of RAM, member of the Bureau of RAM, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Professor.
A well-deserved physician of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the bureau of the Russian public organization, the League of Health of the Nation.
The families of the victims in Ishmailovsky will be helped by the "Teplole"
The heat grid will provide assistance to the families of the victims when the pipe is broken in the Ismaylova Prospect.
Family members were told about it in the company immediately after the tragedy.
Recall that the pipe in the yard of the house on the Ismailov Prospect took place on 28 September.
As a result of the tragedy, several cars collapsed under asphalt, and two young people died on the spot from burns.
ADH became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" scores another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings fall.
It seems that Germans have become seriously tired of Angela Merkel’s immigration policy, which has made the country a desirable target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most notably, recent social surveys indicate that the anti-immigrant party “Alternative for Germany” is becoming more popular and that the positions of the ruling Merkel and Zeehofer bloc are becoming weaker.
This week, ADG broke another record, rising to number two in the popular sympathies rating.
Right-wing conservatives, with 17% popularity, managed to bypass social Democrats, who had about 16%.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to statistical error, but one cannot help but note the fact that the ADG of a small group of Euro-Ceptic economists established in 2013 has become a major political force.
The leadership in the general set-off has so far continued to hold the ruling HCC/HDZ block, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a trend towards the loss of points, with support from the Angela Merkel bloc four percentage points higher in April.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans are in support of Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
In addition, the social Democrats were followed by green (15%), left (11%) and liberals (10%).
Evolution of the Alternatives
The party "Alternative for Germany" was formed in September 2012 on the basis of the group "Alternative Choice 2013", which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The Group initially opposed the government course, but in the first place it dealt only with economic issues, including the euro and EU interaction.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's “supportion” of weak EU economies, not excluding the possibility of a return to the German stamp and a complete withdrawal from the EU.
As the immigration crisis deepened, the ADG political platform expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that took over a niche of Euroskeptics and began to criticize the government severely for failing immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary election in 2017, ADH was able to make the first entry into the Bundestag with 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of "Alternatives for Germany" get a seat in the European Parliament.
A video was published with a journalist who called Ukrainian citizens a "smack-head"
He is the host of a political talk show on Ukrainian TV, author of two books, Osp Drosdov, on live television, confessed that he considered his compatriots to be "a hunch of fools."
They believe TV and don't read much.
According to Drosdov, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We haven't been taught a culture of reading and accepting texts since we were kids," said a journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Television and Radio Broadcasting Committee of Independent States has begun to combat literature, which contains the slightest hints of criticism of the Kiev authorities, prohibiting the importation of as many as 201 editions.
Manchester City beat Brighton and became the leader of the APL.

Canadians built a car in case of an apocalypse, a driving magazine.
Anyone who wants to buy this car can buy it.
Rochel Defence Solutions stated that it had already accepted applications for its new armour.
Rochel Senator APC Apocalypse Armord
On the theme of the apocalypse, money is not only made by video games, film studios, and book publishers.
A new niche is now being developed by car companies.
For example, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its armored armor of the Senator APC.
In a fantasy-free time, this company's engineers are building armoured vehicles for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are not very comfortable, but are safely placed in a whole-ware armoured casing.
This bunker, otherwise it's not a design because it's booked according to standard B7, is installed on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armored, can protect the capsule from grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Apocalypse Armoured Salon of Rochel Senator APC
In order to prevent passengers from being harmed even by an explosive wave that exploded near the vehicle, the car’s cabin is equipped with special amortizing chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.
The Rochel Senator APC vehicle is equipped with a camera system with a night vision function, as well as an inspection armored tower on the roof.
There's no weapon in the car.
Front of the armoured apocalypse, Rochel Senator APC
In order not to affect the mobility of the armoured vehicle, Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong turbodies engine of 6.7 litres, with the full power transferred to the four wheels of the armoured vehicle through a 6-step automatic transmission.
There's no chance of being stuck in the armored apocalypse of Roshel Senator APC.
A special exhibition in Washington, D.C., will be held in October to see the armoured apocalypse of Rochel Senator APC.
Named the time of death of the universe
The universe lasts an additional 140 billion years, ten times the age of the world’s observed, about 13.8 billion years.
A study by an international team of scientists has been placed in the electronics library arXiv.org and has been sent for publication in the Journal of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reported by the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts have come to similar conclusions by monitoring the Subaru telescope using the HSC (Hyper Supplement-Cam) camera over about 10 million galaxies.

Another attempt to merge the initiators of the pension referendum failed.
The opportunity to learn the people ' s opinion on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the general federal action group of the referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that registered different language issues (in total, the Centre had registered five).
They decided to apply to the CEC for the registration of a single initiative group and to ask the Russians, "Would you prefer that the age set by the pension legislation as of 1 July 2018, at which time Russian citizens are entitled to old-age pension, should not be raised?"
This formulation was registered by a sub-group of moisture, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but was considered to be the simplest and most legal vessel.
The majority of the participants in the meeting were supporters of Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and KDPF (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups, from Lower Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg, joined.
Sviridov had previously said to Vedomets that invitations had been sent to all initiators and representatives of some 40 sub-groups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who led the sub-group of moisture (her formulation was supported by another 15 sub-groups), said, "References," that the invitation had not been received or planned to come, "We didn't understand who the friend was and who the enemy was."
Blues singer Otis Rush died.
At the age of 84, the famous Chicago blues guitarist and singer Otis Rush died, reporting to AP with reference to his manager Rick Bates.
He died as a result of complications following a stroke in 2003.
Mr. Rush's creativity has influenced musicians like Carlos Santana and Eric Clapton.
He was well known in 1956 after the release of the song "I Can't Quit You Baby", which took the sixth line of the Billboard R&B rating.
The Admiral has caused us great problems.
Zinatula Bileletdinov: "Admiral" has caused us great problems.
Chief Coach of Aq Barsa Zinatula Bileletdinov summed up the results of the regular KHL championship against the Admiral (4:2).
"The game wasn't easy, it was complicated.
The rival fought well, caused us great problems.
I'm glad we played pretty well in most of us today.
I've already told you, the goal will come someday, and it's important that we work on it.
And that we won is also very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripov a break in this episode?"
"We have our own program that he works on.
That's why there was such a solution," quotes the club's Bilaletdin Press Service.
Ilon Musk will resign as head of the Board of Directors of Tesla
According to the agreement, Mr. Musk will be required to resign as chairman of the board of directors of Tesla and pay a fine of $20 million.
In doing so, the businessman will retain the position of Chief Executive Officer of the company, reports AFP with reference to the regulator's data.
Tesla will also have to pay a $20 million fine.
Previously, the regulator had filed a lawsuit against Ilon Mask - officials thought he had misled Tesla investors because the businessman had allowed the purchase of all company shares at a high price of $420 for paper.
In the Loko-Ahmat match, Turbine's mistakes fell like a horn of abundance.
A former all-union judge, Vladimir Levitin, commented on the work of arbitrator Evgeny Turbine in the 9th round of Russia's Locomotive, "Ahmat", and dealt with controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you judge Eugenia Turbine in the Locomotive-Ahmat match?
- I believe this arbiter has confirmed his unfitness for the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the pressures of the fifth round of Spartacus - Dinamo, neither Turbine nor the leaders of DSI, have drawn serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private omissions of gross techniques fell out of the horn of abundance.
For example, at the 50th minute, Eder's railroadman lays his hands in his fine square with the protector of Akhmata Rodolfo.
It's eight meters from the gate, but Turbine doesn't put on a penalty.
How do you rate the episode of Idov's involvement, which was at the 82nd minute when it seemed like the ball hit his hand?
- I think it was a premeditated act of defence in his fine square.
Turbin was next to the moment, and he could see the episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment should have been seen by the reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
Nevertheless, all three fell asleep, and the penalty was not imposed.
So the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice has been shattered.
It was the same case when the judiciary was replaced and buried by the sporting spirit of the game.
At the 52nd minute Turbine did not decide to remove Oleg Ivanov's guest defender, who broke the rules in his fight against Krikhovyak, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you have to show the second mustard?
At this point, Turbine and the first yellow card showed up not quite on the case.
The second one would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match that there were double standards of justice, that some teams were being punished for violations such as the Idova episode, and some of them weren't.
What do you value from a football player?
- Depends on what you mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't give it to me.
So the arbiter doesn't give a second penalty to the opposite gate.
Here's the principle that's being used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge watches who's playing.
Here he played Locomotive on Saturday, and Ahmat has serious concerns about Turbin's work because the team has been compromised.
Matt Damon played the man charged with raping Judge Cavanaugh at the SNL launch.
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh, who is charged with rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season, "Saturday Night Live" on NBC.
In a small sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at the Senate hearing on charges of rape.
A candidate to the U.S. Supreme Court previously drew attention to his emotionality and the details of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Clobushar.
For example, Cavanaugh repeatedly confessed to his love for beer, but stated that he had never been drunk.
Moreover, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Cavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
Damon also beat those moments.
All I did was drink too much, and I didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin anyone's ever seen.
Everyone knows it," said the judge in Matt Damon's performance.
Cavanaugh was previously elected Supreme Judge of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found her cloned dogs strange in behavior.
The American singer Barbra Streisand claimed that the clones of her dead dog were completely different from the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, [clons] look like her, but it's impossible to clone a soul," stressed a 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Straisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog coton de toulear, named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the Chihuahua dog called Miracle Milli, the world's smallest dog, was cloned for the 49th time.
Professionals are engaged in the cloning of a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The US was thinking about Russia's maritime blockade because of oil and gas supplies.
In the US, Russia’s maritime blockade can begin to gain an advantage in the world energy market.
The American authorities are so determined to fight for success in the world hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the Russian maritime blockade, which remains one of the world’s major energy suppliers.
Ryan Zinke, head of the U.S. Ministry of Internal Affairs, told us about the possibility of a naval blockade the previous day.
Contrary to global practice, the United States Ministry of the Interior does not perform police functions but civilian functions, including natural resource policies.
Therefore, Zinke ' s statement came within the competence of his department, although it was not devoid of political colour.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zink stated that the US Navy controlled maritime routes in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary.
From Zinke’s words, it was clear that the need could be linked to Washington’s desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive a lion’s share of its revenues from the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, as in Eastern Europe, was the main motivation for Moscow's revitalization in the region, I believe Zinke.
The Minister has made it clear that the US is still looking for leadership in the world energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To that end, Washington would have to stifle Russia and Iran and the maritime blockade of trade routes – an acceptable measure in that direction, Zinke believes.
The Kalmish director received good reviews of the festival.
Our countryman, actor Evgeny Sangajeev of the Gohol Center and his film "Harmony" were given special mention of the members of the sixth debut festival "Movement" held in Omsk.
The name of the festival diploma states that "this is a signal for the immediate response of major industrial players in the film."
As is well known, the picture of a young Kalmutz director was presented in the short film program "Movement, Beginning", where eight films took part.
The main prize in this competition program was the painting "Yana is Anja the reverse", the director's debut of the actress Jana Gladky.
The focus of the National Film Festival for the Debut of the Movement is on a young film, but not on the age of the casters, but on the state of their spirit, desire and ability to risk.
And a graduate of the Elisteen Arts School of P. Chonkushov and RATI GITISA Yevgeni Sangajiev meet all these requirements.
He's young, talented, creative, and in his creativity, he's looking for new, innovative forms of self-expression.

Supersonic passenger aircraft in the Russian Federation will be supplied for serial production
The series production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
The Director-General of the Zhukovsky Kirill Sipalo Central Aerodynamic Institute stated this.
According to him, the research centre works on supersonic topics both within international consortia and in cooperation with the Minprompromtorium.
"It's going to take us two or three years to get a technology demonstrator, as well as 10 or 15 years to get a serial machine that can transport through our homeland," he added.
He explained that the question now before Russian experts was how to make technology cost-effective and safe at the same time.
At the beginning of September, the PAO developer, Tupolev, announced the completion of pre-project work on a supersonic passenger aircraft, and calculated that the aircraft would be able to speed up to 1,900 km/h at an altitude of 11 km.
This was reported by the Deputy CEO of Valery Solozobov.
The President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for making Ukraine more European.
He announced it on CNN.
He stated that he could only confirm the words of the columnist Washington Post that Putin’s aggression against Ukraine had resulted in the unification of Ukrainians.
"In 2013, the transatlantic integration of Ukraine and NATO membership supported 16% of Ukrainians.
It's more than 54% right now.
Who did this?
Putin.
In 2013, European integration of Ukraine and accession to the EU supported 33 per cent of Ukrainians.
It's 74% now.
Who did this?
Putin," said Poroshenko.
So thank you, Mr. Putin, for making my country much more European and much more ready to defend European values and transatlantic values.
And we are absolutely confident that we will not return to the Russian Empire,” stressed the President of Ukraine.

There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
Former captain of Chelsea and team of England, John Terry, about why he attended the ninth round of Russia's Spartacus-Rostov championship (0:1).
"In Russia, I have a club I'm following.
I've been watching it quite recently, and I was interested in seeing it from the outside.
I can't say I'm a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartacus, and I want to apologize again for the decision, and Terry's word for the Chelsea fan website.
Let's remind you that Rostau, with 18 points, went to third place in the tournament table, and Spartacus had a fifth line with 15 points in the asset.
On the next round, the red-and-whites on 7 October will play with Enicea, and the wards of Valeria Carpina will accept Orenburg the day before.
The expensive violin was put in a pawn shop for nothing.
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnboard in Somerville, Massachusetts, for an old and unpresentative tool, a pawn shop worker offered only $50.
But the experienced manager Dylan McDermitt suspected it was an old-fashioned and expensive tool, and asked for advice from an expert.
And that's where it turns out that the violin was manufactured in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Gallano and valued at $250,000.
The violin lines alone are estimated at $16 to $18,000.
The investigation found that the violin was recently stolen from a resident of the city and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin came to the person who handed it over to the pawn shop, but it is not known for any previous clashes with the law.
The manager says everyone who brings the violin to the pawn shop will now be asked to play it to make sure it's actually the client's.
In the ninth round of the RPL, we are facing a thrilling confrontation: Spartacus will receive a man in his Stadium in Tushin Rostov under the leadership of Valeria Karpin, a man known to be not a stranger's "people's team."
The fact that the clubs now have an equal score of 15 points, and they divide 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, lagging behind the far-flung Zenita, and being in the same room as the Red-Dar who's playing with Dinamo tomorrow.
The red-and-white people are in a tough spot right now: the club is back surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, Massimo Carrera's team suddenly flew in "Rapidou" and recently gave way to the house "Ahmata".
After the Derby of the CSKA, which ended with a fair tie, Spartacus played at the Black Sea Cup with minimal scores, and it is too early to say whether Russia's most popular club is approaching the crisis.
"Rostov" couldn't win three games in a row, but he doesn't know any defeats for five games.
Let's see if Carpina can extend the win-win series with such a principled match.
The previous meeting between the Karpin Rostova and Spartacus ended in favor of the Metropolitan Team.
It starts at 7:00.
Indonesia is shaken by the aftershock after a powerful tsunami
In Indonesia, where an earthquake occurred a few days ago that triggered a three-metre tsunami, meteorologists observe more than 170 aftershocks.
The magnitude was 7.4, mostly affecting the island of Sulawesi, reported by Russia 24.
The number of deaths exceeded 420 and more than 500 were injured.
The authorities alerted the population to the tsunami threat in advance, but later cancelled it.
The thing is, the instruments didn't detect a wave approaching.
The fate of dozens more people who were preparing to celebrate a national holiday on one of the coastal cities of Palu, which had been most devastated by the natural disaster, was still unknown.
London came up with accusations against Moscow.
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the cold war, as British Defense Minister Gavin Williamson said.
But England will defend its values, he stressed at the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
Threats are increasing, Iran and North Korea are increasingly dangerous, enemies are operating in grey areas through cyberattacks and false news, added the Minister.
But the biggest one is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians have repeatedly been refuted by Moscow and transmitted to TASS.
At the same time, the head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunt, said that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not adhere to international rules and used chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March this year, ex-colonel GRU Sergey Skripal, convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Julia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum to join the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighbouring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighbouring Greek province.
One of the first votes was made by Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, a fervent supporter of the renaming of the Republic to Northern Macedonia.
The preparations for the referendum and the voting today are monitored by international organizations.
The head of the observer mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of the observers was organized:
Approximately 100 teams travelled around the country to monitor the entire process today, from the opening of polling stations to the closing of polling stations, then the counting of votes and the drafting of protocols.
For a month, 10 of our teams have been working in the country to monitor preparations for the vote, the media, the law on the financing of electoral campaigns and the organization of the referendum.
Faye Dulgeri: "Around 500 foreign observers are closely following the voting.
Observer groups shall record in detail what is happening and communicate with members of the electoral commissions in order to present them in the final report.”
The translator compared the mentality of the Russians to the Germans.
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a major role in understanding.
This was reported on 30 September, International Translator Day, by the professional interpreter-synchronist Bärbel Sachsé.
She has been translating Russian and English for over 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan things quietly, and the Russians, as the proverb says, "have a long time to go."
But it seems to me that for understanding among peoples and for the work of an interpreter, it doesn't matter," said the expert in the comment "RIA News."
According to the translator, to understand that two countries need to know each other's history.
And in the future, Saxe pointed out that Germany has no point in ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there's no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny," she said.
The day before, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated that the country was trying to “link” and maintain relations with Russia.
She said that the Northern Flow 2 gas pipeline project, built from the coast of Russia to Germany on the Baltic Sea floor, was particularly important for Berlin.

Putin appointed a new Head of the Office of the President for Foreign Policy
Vladimir Putin was edicted to release Alexander Manjosin from his post as Head of the Office of the President for Foreign Policy.
He was replaced by Igor Neverov.
Mr. Manjosin has been running the Office of the President for Foreign Policy since 2004.
One of the reasons for his departure from the Kremlin was that the source “OJ” referred to personal circumstances, noting that there were no substantial claims for the quality of the work under the head of management.
Igor Neverov was previously headed by the Second European Department of MIDA.
In 2009-2014, he was the Russian Ambassador to Sweden.
The Russians donated one ruble for a low-wage deputy.
In Yekaterinburg, the People's Charitable Foundation opened a fund-raising campaign for a member of the State Duma Vera Gangzi, who complained about a low salary.
The campaign can be tracked on the organization's website.
The Human Charity Foundation expresses the hope that the whole world will be able to save the servant of the people.
We ask all interested people to give us a chance to live and a happy future!
All funds collected will be transferred to the poor in person.
God save you!" said the fund.
All the charity wants to raise 380,000 rubles for the deputy, which is the equivalent of a month's salary.
Reports of assistance received are published on the VKontakte page of the fund, where the organizers post screenshots of remittances.
The most frequent amounts of donations are one rouble and 50 kopecks.
At the time of publication, Russians had donated 1633 rubles to Vera Ganze.
The fund-raising opened on 28 September following a low-income complaint by Ganzi.
According to her, the average salary of the deputy was 380,000 roubles, from which nothing remained, and therefore had to be spent on a credit card.
Ganjia visited that parliamentarians were not compensated for hospitality.
Subsequently, the State Duma stated that it would consider the possibility of paying representation fees to deputies.
The Golden Sculpture of the San Sebastian Festival received the film "The Between the Two Seas"
The painting "Entre dos aguas" by Spanish director Isaki Lacuesta was recognized as the best film of the 66th International Film Festival in San Sebastian.
The tape won the main award of the festival, the Golden Sculpture.
The Norwegian actress Pia Tielta won the Silver Spoon Award as the best actress for the tape "Blind Spot".
The best actor was named Dario Grandinetti, Argentina, for the film "Red" (Rojo).
The director of the same film, Benjamin Ny state, was awarded the rank of best director.
The night school comedy was headed by an American box office.
The night school comedy, which debuted at American cinemas last Friday, earned $28 million for its first weekend.
This result allowed an unthinkable painting with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to lead the United States box office from 28 to 30 September.
On the international market, the film, so far released in only 20 countries, has raised $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the fight for the first line, Malcolm Lee's creation, which is remarkable, has been quite markedly preceded by another Western-rent novelist, a cartoon called "Smolfoot", a curious history of a charming Bigfoot meeting a human being whose existence the main hero never believed.
The Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig's project of directors raised $23 million for their start-up weekends, meeting the expectations of experts who predicted 20 to 25 million tapes for the weekend.
As for Smolfoot's total fees, they now amounted to $38.6 million (with it debuting in 50 countries already): Mexico was the most active in this area, adding $3.6 million to the film's treasury.
Three of the strongest this time, the children's fairy tale "The Mystery of the House with the Hours" was shut down by the horror master Eli Roth, who finally proved that the director was able to make quality movies for audiences 12+.
In her second week of renting, John Bellers' book with the charming Jack Black and Kate Blanchett made $12.5 million, bringing the global total to 53.8 million.
Despite his departure from top 3, he continues to be surprised by the sign "+" thriller from Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick's "Simple Request": in 17 days in the United States, Paul Fig's painting, from which some unrealistic financial performances were not originally expected from the word "all of it," raised $43 million (including 6.6 million for 28-30 October) and now has a total revenue of 62.9 million.
The last representative of the first five this week was the Horror of the Noon's Curse, which collected $5.4 million over the reporting period.
Spin-of-theatre's 24 days in American (and not only of course) cinemas have $330 million in total earnings and have recently been proud to be the most successful film of the franchise, which also includes two parts of the "Slave" itself and two tapes on Annabel's creepy doll.
Following the horror of Corinne Hardy, another member of the genre, the debutant of the Hellfest, one of the year’s main youth horrors, arrived at the end of the last weekend.
On his first weekend, Gregory Plotkin, a famous engineer (and recently director), who had previously worked on a number of large chorror projects, including Happy Death Day, for which Hellfest had a lot of resemblance, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the results are very positive.
The seventh was "The Crazy Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), who seem to be not thinking of falling out of the top 10 of the American box office: the romantic comedy that has been on the screen for the seventh week, the September figure being the sixth highest in the history of the genre's cash tapes, with a total of 165.7 million.
This is the sum of the current picture in the domestic market: the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million.
With regard to the last three lucky ten in the United States from 28 to 30 September, they were the Predator, the White Boy Rick, and the Black Mint, earning $3.7 million, $2.38 million and 1.1 million, respectively, over the past weekend.
And let's add that next weekend in the United States, the long-awaited Vienna with Tom Hardy, who -- you can be sure of that -- will take over leadership in the United States box office on the first weekend of October.
From the other premiere of the coming week, the musical melodrama "Star Born", the winner of the Venice Film Festival from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama "Your Hate."
The head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs paid tribute to the victims of Nazism in Italy
There was an act in Mardbacto in northern Italy to commemorate the victims of the Nazi punitive operation, in which some 770 people were killed in September and October 1944.
Most of them are women and children.
This year, the head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Haiko Maas, participated in the ceremony.
He said that "with deep sorrow and great shame" was bowing down to the victims of the murder and their families.
Maas promised to oppose nationalism in the struggle for freedom, mutual respect and friendship between Italy and Germany.
His Italian colleague Enzo Moavero-Milanezi, a German minister, arrived in Mardbato.
In the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is emphasized that the heads of foreign policy agencies are participating in the ceremony for the first time, and this symbolizes the desire of both countries to preserve the memory of the crimes of the past.

Valery Belov: God helped Siberia today.
Vitasia's chief coach, Valery Belov, about the defeat of Siberia (3:4) in the regular KHL championship.
"The colleague was talking about Siberia fans, and I want to celebrate our fans," he says the official Vitasie website.
"I hope they'll also be supportive, 'cause now almost every game is full of stadiums, great atmosphere.
In the game, perhaps God was helping Siberia today because they were very grossly wrong, especially our leaders.
We've lost a micro-game -- zero, three of our leading leaders, so it's been hard for us to get out of this game, even though there were moments.
But still, I'll take the blame.
'Cause they must have missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was a different team."
"It's an ugly cummy."
The audience is outraged by Agustina's choice of voice show.
The audience of Voice 60+ accuses Leonid Agustin's mentor of "smuggling and brazen pranks."
When in blind auditions he first learned his father’s voice, Nikolai Agutin, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But his son’s feelings prevailed, and he chose a relative on his team.
At that time, many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor the partiality of the first stage.
But the joke took a long time, and the star's father took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agustina for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience of the show, resented the indignant and blatant dragging our close relatives into the final staircase.
I had already doubted that Agutina would have the strength and the conscience not to drag his father to the end of his first place,” Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larin reasoned on TV Man.
Meanwhile, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutin "sleed" beautiful performers who actually sang, while Nikolai Petrovic whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience still wanted to see his father's show.
But as it turns out, it's not the case at all, the audience wants an objective evaluation and to see really talented performers in the final, and now Agustin has discredited the show.
"I'm sorry for the Vote team from Agustina, they were doomed."
"The last time Agustin showed him how much he loved Dad, "and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave his father in the project who does not sing but whispers, how can you then call a mentor?"
"I like Dad's singing, make him a concert in the Kremlin for your money, and see how many people are coming to this concert."
It's the Voice show, not the Bloody Relatives show.
"It was unprofessional from Agustin's side."
"Then you have to offer your own show to Dad, not the show that comes from Channel 1 money."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other player with real vocal data.
Why did a surgut worker with a great voice and a tembro leak, and Dad Agustina got to the finals?
And then we all complain about the same faces on stage and on screens for decades!
'Cause you can't get through the chimney."
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
There's a circle of blah and gum.
And there's a lot of money in the family budget!
The theater of absurdity continues!"
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional Voices, the son of Gradsky was released at blind auditions.
Then it never occurred to me to take my son on my own team.
In fact, he said, "Come on, get out of here, I get it."
Agustin couldn't do as a professional.
Military Canada was allowed to wear beards to boost the spirit
The Department of Defense of Canada has issued an order allowing military personnel to wear beards.
According to CBC, the bill contains instructions on beard care.
It is noted that the military may be ordered to shave “for security reasons”.
The military beard cannot be longer than 2 cm, it must also be carefully trimmed and the neck and cheekbones must be shaved.
However, Navy personnel were allowed to wear beards only on land.
The innovation is expected to increase the morale in the army and attract more Canadians to the service.
The ban on wearing beard has been in effect in the Canadian army since World War II.
It was previously reported that police officers in France were also allowed to wear beards and even to have tattoos.
At the same time, the court in Egypt upheld the suspension of police officers wearing beards.

Because of the amendments to the law on equity construction, the developers will have to lend their full credit to the bank.
And a lot of experts have already talked about the possibility of a large travel of apartments.
But as it turns out, not everyone agrees.
In the center of Kiev, a robber threatened a man with a knife, forcing him to take money from the ATM.
The incident took place on the evening of 29 September in Ivan Kudry Street, reported by law enforcement officers.
According to the victim, the unsub approached him and started a conversation, but then suddenly grabbed the knife and demanded that he be given the money and cell phone.
Since the victim had no cash, the stranger ordered the withdrawal of the money from the bank card.
After the attacker received 4,000 hryvnias and a telephone, he hit the victim and fled,” the communication states.
Law enforcement officers managed to apprehend the robber, and they turned out to be a 25-year-old kiyavanian.
He now faces up to seven years of imprisonment.
The police are also working on the theory of the perpetrator's involvement in other such crimes.
Let's remind you, the day before, there were several resonant robberies in Odessa.
In one case, armed robbers were caught using a drone.
A scientist described a possible scientific program for a Russian expedition to the Moon
The head of the RAN Institute for Space Research, RAN correspondent Anatoly Petrukovich, told RIA News about a possible research programme for Russian astronauts on the Moon.
According to him, the scientific community is in the process of developing guidelines for such work.
"No consolidated opinion yet," stressed the scientist.
He noted that one option was to place a low-frequency radiotelescope on the back of the Moon, thus avoiding interference from the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to explore space sources of radio radiation," he added.
He also believes that the Moon could be used to test robotics and use local resources for construction.
In addition, a scientist believes that astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organics on Earth's satellite.
This could help us to determine how life emerges on planets.
The head of Roscosmos had previously said that the Russian Federation was optimistic that it could carry out a manned flight to the Moon by 2030.
An offended client threw out a basket of faeces at 7-Eleven.
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, called Florida, had a tooth on the manager of a 7-Eleven 24-hour network store: in May, he kicked him out of the store for inappropriate behavior.
So he decided to take revenge on his enemy in the original way.
In the middle of the second night, he entered the shop and threw it on the floor and on some of the goods on the shelves the contents of the basket he had brought with him.
In the basket were the fecals and urine that Simms "borrowed" from a nearby mobile biota.
The police who arrived at the scene arrested the vigilante.
He was put in prison and released before a $300 bail trial.
He was charged with unlawful invasion of someone's property and criminal offence and was prohibited from entering the shop and approaching the manager.
Although Simms' crime seems funny rather than serious, his conviction may be harsh enough, as he has repeatedly violated the law: large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, drunk driving and abuse of animals.
The U.S. called Russia's most threatening submarine
The most formidable enemy submarin for the US fleet will be the Russian sub-ship Kazan of the Yasen-M Project, writing The National Interest.
The submarine was released in March 2017, but the Navy will have it in 2019.

We will face a severe potential adversary.
Just take a look at "Severodwinsk," quotes The National Interest Counter Admiral Dave Johnson.
At the same time, the publication states that the United States retains an advantage in this industry over Russia.
The multipurpose nuclear submarines Kazan, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk and Archangelsk are built on an improved Yasen-M project (885M).
They have a displacement of 13,800 tons, a depth of 520 metres, a crew of 64, an autonomy of 100 days and a submarine speed of 31 knots.
Submarines are armed with mines, torpedoes 533 mm, Onyx and Caliber cruise missiles.
In August, U.S. Press stated that the U.S. submarine force remained the "most powerful and frightening" on the planet.
German politicians ignored the opening of the mosque because of Erdogan.

Deutsche Welle writes about it.
The event was attended by the President of Turkey, Recep Tayip Erdoğan.
Lachet met Erdoğan at Cologne airport, but refused to go to the mosque, explaining that the event could have become a “extremely politicized event”.
Recker reported having received an informal invitation the day before the opening on Friday, 28 September.
According to her Spokesperson, such a proposal should be viewed as late and not serious.
Speaking in front of the mosque, Erdoğan summed up a two-day visit to Germany.
The President described them as successful, he said, and he was able to meet with President Frank-Walter Steinmeyer and Chancellor Angela Merkel, with whom he discussed, inter alia, the fight against racism and Islamophobia.
The new mosque in Cologne has become one of the largest in Europe and has the capacity to accommodate at the same time some 1.1 thousand believers.
Construction cost 30 million euros, financed by the Turkish side.

It proved to be a former employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, who is currently working as an agent of an insurance company in Ukraine.
According to the U.S. Press Centre, the detainee explained that the vehicle had been wanted by Interpol since 2014, and was therefore detained in Russian territory and handed over to him as a representative of the insurance company.
When he crossed the Ukrainian-Russian border, he removed the fake registration plates, but at the entrance to Kiev he re-established them.
According to him, he did so “to ensure that the registration numbers of the vehicle package were in conformity with the said vehicle issued by the Russian representatives of Interpol in case the vehicle was stopped for inspection by the Ukrainian police”.
“A set of measures is currently being implemented to verify the explanations provided, as well as to establish its possible involvement in terrorist activities”, stated the ISA.

In the U.S., a possible maritime blockade against Russia was announced.
If necessary, the United States could impose a maritime blockade on Russia to prevent its supply of energy to the countries of the Middle East.
The U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, said so.
Speaking at an industrial event in the American city of Pittsburgh, the head of the department stated that the only source of income for the Russian economy was energy sales, and Moscow pursued an active policy in the Middle East to sell oil and gas, as it did in Europe, by Washington Examiner.
Zinke also noted that the situation was similar with Iran.
In the view of the Minister, there are two options for dealing with it: military and economic.
He would prefer not to use the former, so pressure must be put on Iranian energy resources.

I couldn't do anything, and it hurt so much.
Sergei Orotkin: I couldn't do anything, and it hurt so much.
The Russian pilot Williams, Sergey Orotkin, commented on the results of the Russian Grand Prix.
"To be honest, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second corner, I ended up between two cars, which I was caught in the first place.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, the moment, right away.
Turned out to be in a very bad position.
I'm stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the rest of us hit the pit stop, we'd get into clean air, and we'd get back to speed, but the rubber was gone.
Plus, he fought his partner, he had contact with him, too.
I understand he's a little mistaken.
We were in this situation on the roughest track of the season, and there was nothing I could do, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," quotes Orokin RIA's words "News."
Let's remind you that the Orotkin race at the Russian Grand Prix ended on the 18th, won by the British Mercedes pilot Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev called it absurd to suspend Glushakov and Jenko from the base of Spartacus.
The President of the Federation of Tennis of Russia (FTP) Shamil Tarpsichev commented on the suspension of footballers of Moscow's “Spartak” Denis Glushakov and Andrey Jenko from training with the main members after liquor to criticize the chief coach of the Massimo Carrera team, reports the Sports Weekend.
Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
It's stupid to pay attention to things like that.
I totally disagree with what Carrera's doing.
It only deepens the breakdown in the team.
First of all, they're poems, and you can read and read them as you like.
I wouldn't have reacted if I were Carrera.
Everyone has their own opinions.
Second of all, everyone wants to have a good time.
If Glušakov and Jenko are liking, that doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to perceive the situation.
And it's not a normal climate on the team.
Spartacus doesn't have a game today, so it didn't have to be a big deal.
Maybe we should have laughed about it together.
Spartacus has a lot of problems in different lines, there's a lack of identity after being admitted to the youth.
Relationships within the team seem not to add optimism before this match," I'm sure Tarpshawk.
The two teams will play on September 30 and begin at 7 p.m. Moscow time.
Formerly rejected Spartak, John Terry led Chelsea's youth team.
Sirius' teachers discussed natural technologies with scientists.
Teachers of the Sirius Education Centre in Sochi, participants at the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists from the National Research Centre “Kurchatov Institute”.
A presentation by researchers took place within the framework of a programme of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Natural Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on the website of the education centre on 29 September.
The lecture was opened by a documentary film entitled "Courchatova's Codes", in which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, RAN correspondent Mikhail Kowalchuk, spoke about global challenges as a driving force for civilization.
The scholar's lecture is published on Sirius' website.
School students learned that modern technology needs huge amounts of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such amounts.
Environmental technologies that young scientists are working on today will help to solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum.
In addition, Kowalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of natural technologies, as well as the risks inherent in the development of such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, a huge good.
It's an explosive increase in medical technology, it's an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's another side.
The development of natural technologies is actually a technological replication of wildlife systems.
There's a back side-- targeted interference with human activity.
There are always risks.
A car showed up and people started to die under the wheels.
But they still use cars.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I'm creating medical new technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," quotes scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask the participants questions.
The speakers were Julius Djakov, a candidate for physics and mathematics, Vjaceslav Demin, the head of the Kurchatov Complex of IBICS-like Environmental Technologies, the Kurchatov Institute, and the head of the Kurchatov Complex of IBICS-Technologies.
The “Sirius” educational centre in Sochi was established by the “Talant and Success” educational foundation, based on the Olympic infrastructure, at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Macedonia: No referendum due to low attendance
The referendum was intended to endorse an agreement between the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country “North Macedonia”.
Greece objected to Macedonians using the name of their historical province.
The change of name led the former Yugoslav Republic to open the way to NATO and later to the EU.
But according to EFE, only 34% of the Sunday plebiscite's appearances were "not reaching" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only of a consultative nature, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to refuse to change.
Speaking shortly after the closure of polling stations, Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a supporter of changing the name of the Republic, stated that if there were more yes votes, Macedonia would change the name despite an unattainable quorum.

Kemerovchan has outraged the herd of sheep at the cemetery.
On September 30, an eyewitness reported on a famous Kemerovo social network page that a local cemetery was free to walk horned animals.
A large flock of animals walked between the fence and plucked grass.
Commentators expressed different views: some local residents noted that there was no harm to small cattle in the presence of the cemetery and that their appetite could even help to clear the area from weeds and grass, but some of the city's inhabitants did not enjoy:
"This is a grave, not a pasture.
There's nothing for the rams to do there.
Of course, you can't say they're blaspheming, but it's not a matter."
In one way or another, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the animal problem in the middle of the cemetery was already known and action would soon be taken.
To push and touch, what's the right thing?
There's no word to push.
That's right. To get involved.
The word "press" in the meaning of "stress, influence, influence" exists only phonically, because we hear sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "satisfy."
We use that word to think it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "satisfaction" are not only not close, but even in some sense opposite.
Make sure you do.
Length (church-book, obsolete) means “satisfied, full, sufficient, sufficient for anyone or anything, sufficient to satisfy”.
Satisfaction, pleasure is related words.
He used to have the meaning of "don't depend on anything, have a self-satisfactory meaning" -- "be content with yourself."
Old-Slawish "wowl'ti" is related to the words "give" and "will."
Pushing, suppressing, it's completely different.
These words have truly frightening "reciprocations": daos - "wolf" - "wolf" - "deyja" - "dead" - and "dvaid" - "coercion".
A similar phonic appearance of the words “pressure” and “satisfaction”, as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter, led them to contaminate.
So we have this most "d" that is used in writing through "a", which is, in a good way, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the creation and development of these words.
All right, let's get this over with.
But it's an old word that's no longer used in the right sense.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word "press."
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember, it's a cleric.

"Kimi, did you have a chance today to fight for the pole?
How good was the car?"

What's the reason?"

He was preparing to try and still managed to miss me, but I guess I lost some time on it.
But I don't think that has had a big impact on the result."
"In Sochi, it's very hard to pass, is starting a race the key?"
"Please, yes, but you never know how it's gonna work.
It won't be easy anyway, because our car is much slower than Mercedes cars."

Wonders happen in our lives after all!
One of them was tweeted by German journalist Christie Dietz.
She wrote on her page that her four-year-old son parked his bike (child without pedals) around the same lamppost throughout the year.

"Thanks for the wonderful association in this world."
"I think there's a lot of people in the world who can do that."
"Unfortunately, they don't attract the same attention as the bad guys."
"This is the world we need!"
Readers asked the journalist if she could find out who was the author of the idea, to tell her about it.
I mean, this man is probably somewhere near here, and he's been watching the baby park on a number of occasions, if that's what came to his mind.

It'll be interesting to watch his speeches next year," says Aleshin SMP Racing.

Refugees and migrants should not be considered as others, and migration itself should be the mother of that society.
Numerous migrant communities and anti-racism organizations had sent an open letter to the Minister requesting his resignation.
Russia has protected itself from terrorists through an operation in Syria.
In three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists were killed, 85,000 of whom destroyed the Russian Air and Space Forces.
On the occasion of the third anniversary of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former head of the FAC, Victor Bondareev, Head of the Federation Defence and Security Council Committee, described this.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air-to-air weapons: the air-to-space forces had targeted and continued to strike precisely the targets of the terrorists.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist sites have been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition storage, fortification and headquarters.
With the help of Russian air strikes, jihadist defenses have been hacked, a decisive contribution to Syrian government forces' advancement, passing Interfax.
However, according to Bondarev, our military operation in Syria has protected Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic were under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IS, prohibited in Russia) and the Jebhat al-Nusru (prohibited in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, some 4,000 Russian fighters and some 5,000 citizens of the post-Soviet countries have been fighting on the IG side, and TASS has been handed over.
And these are only registered persons, not counting those who have not been identified, but they have stressed Bondarev.
Most of them were trained and ready to take arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter our territory freely.
Thus, Bondarev noted that in Syria Russia is fighting international terrorism at a long distance, otherwise this evil would “shall come to us”.
Boris Johnson and a number of British ministers' phones have been made public.

We are studying the causes of the malfunction and apologizing for any problems caused,” said the Conservative Party.
During the crash, users could not only see confidential data, but also edit information in the profile of politicians and journalists.
For example, in the profile of the Minister of Environment, Environment and Agriculture, Michael Gove, his picture was replaced by a picture of the mediamagnate Rupert Murdock.
Syria accused the US of supporting terrorism
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Muallem, accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism.
The [West] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian town of Rakka, destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which it was targeted, and massacred civilians, including children and women.
These killings under international law are war crimes," he said.
According to Muallem, the US and its partners provided “direct support to the terrorists” because the targets of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and meant “sowning chaos, death and destruction on their way”.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost complete and the country has become more secure and stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intended to rid Syria of its illegal foreign presence and that priority in the reconstruction of the country would be given to Syrian partners.

This was announced by the Head of State during his visit to Kharkov province, commenting on the issuance by Hungary of its passports in Zakarpatia.
By protecting Ukrainian citizens, I am defending the sovereignty of our State.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other States, we demand the same respect for Ukraine,” stressed Poroshenko.
According to Poroshenko, as President, he will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they may be, in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the Head of State supported the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the passport scandal against Hungary, which was intended to expel the consul of that country from the Coast.
"I fully share every letter that is said by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs," noted the President.
According to FACTS, on 19 September, a video was posted on the network recording the time of the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens at the Hungarian Consulate in the Coast of Hungary.
In doing so, they vowed their allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavel Klimkin, noted that the consul of Hungary, who appeared in a video of the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, was to leave Ukraine either by decision of Budapest itself or would be expelled by Kiev.

More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict that has been going on in Syria for seven years.
Some five million people fled to other countries, particularly neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
In the view of Damascus, military action is now nearing its end, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
This was stated by Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem in his address to the United Nations: “The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure as a result of the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists, bringing them back to normal.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country which they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions, which have complicated lives and deprived them of their means of subsistence.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to facilitate the return of refugees and to provide funds for that purpose.
Meanwhile, the US and EU countries refuse to provide assistance to Syria, saying that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.
Volkswagen fully pleaded guilty to "deselgate" in January 2017.
Last December, Oliver Schmidt was sentenced to seven years in prison, one of the managers of the American division of the company.
The contract losses are estimated at at least 25 billion euros.
This amount is not limited to fines and compensation.
Until June next year, the car manufacturer is obliged to buy or correct 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the company’s management stated that the obligations had already been met for 83 per cent of the vehicles, so that the programme would be completed early.
Volkswagen is always trying to make up for the losses and restore the client's trust.
For example, there has recently been a change in the management of the firm and a major restructuring and policy change in the management system has been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy out even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: this power was granted in February this year.

Mitropolitan Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the UCP with the fascists' actions
The head of the Synodial Division of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Mitropolitan Ilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It's like wearing a yellow star on a Jew in fascist Germany, which means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and that's what this bill was for," said the mitropolitan on Russian 24 (interfax citation).
In his view, that step would have the most serious consequences at a time when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was at an acute stage.
Kyiv thus hopes to gain full control over the CCP and “outlaw it”, the clergyman believes.
"It's a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church think they're Ukrainian, they're patriots of their country," he added.
It has previously been reported that the deputies of the Verkhovna are pleased to be working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter implies the renaming of the Moscow Patriarchate ' s PCP.
The deputy of the Pochayev laurel called for the protection of Orthodox and Ukrainian shrines
The deputy of the St.-Uspen Pochayev Laura, Mitropolitan Vladimir, made a call for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UCP) was published on Saturday on the home site.
In various times of history, our predecessors and relatives in faith and spirit had to practice their faith and defend their holy places.
Given the situation and the information we have and the death threats that are spreading, it is clear that we too will have to survive,” said the Mitropolitan Police.
He asked for support -- prayerful, moral.
Also, the viceroy of the laurel stressed that perhaps "you'll need your physical presence."
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren, by spirit, threaten with slaughter, and therefore protect our holy place."
Who cares about the fate of the Pochayev laurel, the Orthodox Ukrainian and the world’s shrine, needs to be prepared to protect it, says the appeal.
The Mitropolitan called on those who deceive believers not to go about it.
The CCP has a canonical status defined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 from Mother Church.
And now someone wants to make it dependent on the news patriarch and the Catholic Pope's friend Bartholomew.
The new style, with its consequences, is unacceptable to the Orthodox.
And we're pleased with the status that our church has," noted the viceroy of the laurels.
He recalled that the CPI had been canonically independent and fully autonomous in its administration since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
What other Tomos do we need?" noted the Mitropolitan Pochayevsky Vladimir, calling upon believers and all citizens to ask whether there are other Tomos denominations, are they independent of the Vatican?
Those who believe have figured out to some extent what kind of temple they should go to.
Some, however, want to stir up enmity and strife again.
Some are envious that the domes are shining on the temples they want to destroy, the priest emphasized.
The Postajev laurel is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The laurels are located on the top of the Pochayev Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopol.
Its first historical record dates back to the beginning of the 13th century.

A secular lioness published another sad post at Instagram, which made her followers angry.
"I never thought that feelings could have a price.
Life continues to teach me... and when I begin to learn about people, "Buzova wrote.
Many fans reacted negatively to this post and noted that, in fact, the singer had never seen a real life.
"You're the one who hasn't suffered yet.
You cling to every word, live in a normal, normal family," wrote @nataliamama37.
There were some who advised Bouzova to consult psychologists or at least read books on the subject.
"Maybe you should read psychology literature.
What do you have to do to avoid being a victim?" @liashukgalina wrote.
However, there were others who supported the singer.
"Ola, don't get upset.
Your man will not speak loud words all over the country and then simply not do them," supported Bouzova @arina_prostile.

Nazarov had previously explained her decision to take 2 million rubles and to abandon the Buza because the singer had no sympathy for him.
He decided to send all the money to charity.

Chief Coach of the Moscow Dinamo, Vladimir Vorobiev, about the defeat of the Automobilist (0:1) in the regular KHL championship.
"That was a good game, interesting, though it went to the goal," quotes Sparrow's official website "AV".
"We used to play very easy.
I really liked the first period.
Didn't use a few good moments.
In the second period, we got a little pushy, we survived.
But removing us is a little "feeded."
The guys played great, did the coaching setup.
I think if we keep playing the right game, we'll win.
They didn't score, they don't win with zero, but the content of the game was the right one.
"Luck will come if we continue to play in this direction."
"In your opinion, did the Automobilist add to the meeting in Lower Novgorod?"
"Then the foreign line didn't play.
At the pre-season, the teams were doing other tasks, playing a lot of young guys.
I think there was a completely different game, another hockey game.
Automobile is a good team.
It's clear from the tournament table that the team is playing the right game.
Good hockey, good atmosphere in the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them luck.
The command is moving in the right direction.
A lot of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good goalie.
It was hard, we were getting ready.
They knew the team was going without defeat, they wanted to break it, but it didn't work out."

The Chief Macedonian Opposition refused to vote in a referendum
Macedonia is holding a referendum on Sunday, 30 September, on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece to rename the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: “Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?”
Nevertheless, Christian Mitzko, leader of the leading opposition party “Inner Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity” (WMRO-DPMNE), stated that he would not vote in a referendum.
According to the press secretary of the party, Nahum Stoilkovsky decided to abstain from voting in order to express his opposition to a treaty that he considered “bad”.
According to the Spokesman, the current referendum addresses the issue of the country’s renaming, and nothing more, while the party’s strategic goal is to gain membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, President George Ivanov of Macedonia refused to participate in the referendum on 30 September.
He explained that he had chosen a name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader considered the renaming of the country to be a negative factor.
“A new semi-sovereign State is being created with a new name”, noted Ivanov.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic, the Republic of Northern Macedonia, was signed by the heads of the Macedonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Greece on 17 June this year at a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespá, which runs the border between the two countries.
This treaty should resolve a long-standing dispute about the name of the country, as well as Skopje's journey to NATO and the EU, is similar to the TASS.

The US is setting up an increase in opium production in Afghanistan
The sharp deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September has been extensively reported in Tehran.
There were multi-stakeholder consultations involving Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nikolai Patrouchev.
Indeed, in Afghan territory, the militants unleashed a real terrorist war against the State authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year has been a record year in the number of bloody terrorist attacks that have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans,” said Patrouchev.
Afghanistan's troubles didn't start yesterday.
Following the attacks of 11 September 2001, the Al-Qaida terrorist group (prohibited in the Russian Federation) was declared to be the main enemy of the United States.
Within a month, America and NATO allies began a military operation there, "Indestructible Freedom."
It's been 17 years.
A multi-thousand American contingent is now on Afghan soil.
And a peaceful life is even more ghostous than it was then.
The American troops have been pushed behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
How can they get paid off by the militants for money so they don't get touched?
The Government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40 per cent, according to Patrouchev.
50 per cent in the Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
10 per cent more for ISIL terrorists (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they grow up there fast.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-khaliphate in Central Asia, exactly what they failed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be okay with that.
It is also acceptable that the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times in the 17 years of American presence.
The huge growth of the area planted with opium poppy and multi-billion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in the EU and NATO accession referendum, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbour to be called Macedonia, seeing in that name an attempt on the same name Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is entitled to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will secure the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone very happy.”
The renaming of the country is promoted by the ruling social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Conservative opposition and President George Ivanov are against it.
According to the journalist Clementin Chilimanov, Macedonia has no point in joining the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it: “Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, led by Zayev, is being imposed from outside to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
Clearly, there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice made by Macedonian citizens will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole.”
