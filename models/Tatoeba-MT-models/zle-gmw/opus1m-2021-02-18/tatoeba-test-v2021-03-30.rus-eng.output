I can't explain it to you.
He's scared of dogs.
The party was full of girls.

Tom pretended nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd quit smoking.
Stay here with them.
The accident almost cost him his life.
He cracked the bottle off.
We're home now.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I didn't agree.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you don't get me wrong.
Why are you so mysterious?
You're just running away from life's problems.

Can you believe that?
We slept in the open.
Don't lock the door.

Is there a pharmacy around here?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why is Tom looking at me like that?
I called the police and told them my car was stolen.
We can talk about this later.
It's a little helpful.
Cats in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.
Can I be honest?

Can I trust you with a secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a singer.
Should we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your fault.
Tom told everyone he was adopted.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Take her somewhere.
I was just there when it happened.

None of us want this to happen.
How much more wine to buy?
I'm not gonna cheat.
He got in the car and left.
Tell Tom about everything that happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.

We can't afford to buy a new car.
It only makes the problem worse.

I saw Jesse standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.

Something very good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't get involved in other people's business.
Who's in the blue shirt?
Tom has an American accent.
I don't have the money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
Carrots are good for your eyesight.

His house is over the hill.
It was Sunday, and I didn't get up early.
How many pens!
Mary, are you in proper shape right now?
I made a mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom did 20 push-ups.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary slapped Tom, threw a glass of wine through him and came out of the restaurant, and there was a dead silence.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We recognized them.
Tom's gonna paint the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you're gonna need a loan.

Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in pots in winter.
I speak French.
If that sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where you found it.
Tom should have told Mary.
Why is everyone looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you it would work.
It all seems so weird.
Tom decided to go.
You taught me a lot.

There's been so much going on today.
I saw a car hit a man.
We accepted their invitation.

The universe is endless.
I'm not ready to do that yet.

I saw it happen.
I think there can be no other reason than this.
I'm very happy right now.
My apartment was robbed last week.
How can you always be so energetic?
Put your signature here.

I thought you were Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
Sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy this.
I've never seen you wearing a hat.
Put him on the shelf.
I thought you found someone else.
There's always a lot of vehicles on this road.
You tricked us all.
I don't think Tom has any brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
It makes no sense to pretend that you're making me believe that I believe in something you don't believe in!

Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I threw the ball.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized to us.
He read that book yesterday.
Where did Tom find this picture?
Tom gave me both money and advice.
What do you want me to say?
Please open the door.
Tom said he didn't want to sleep yet.
She married him at the age of 20.
I can't give that dictionary to anyone.
Give me that box.
They say his father died in a foreign country.
Take mine.
I know Tom's taller than Mary.
I didn't have time to do it today.
Mary told Tom she'd help him.
The multiple number of "person" is "people", not "persons".
That's two steps away.
You ruined it!
I think Tom should have stayed in Boston.
Did you invite him?
Tom told me the baby's name.
Tom thinks I'm in Boston right now.
Tom didn't want to buy a new car.
We're teachers.
Tom will find you.
Everyone has weaknesses.
I hope you're well paid.
Tom didn't eat meat at all.
This book seemed interesting to me.
Hundreds of unemployed sleep there day and night.
I guess I'm gonna be late.
Do your kids know French?
Tom screamed and ran out of the room.
This soup gives it to the fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He talks too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
You didn't know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to buy time.
I've already discussed it with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke in the terrible Galilee dialect of the Aramean language, in the Jewish sense, instead of Hebrew, thus demonstrating the impropriety of the claim that there is a sacred language, the use of which in prayers is particularly closer to God.
In the end, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is a little different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
Tom was paid $300 for it.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom's gonna do.
The weather forecast wasn't wrong.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll have Tom make you something to eat.
I'm gonna go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom didn't wear a tie.
That's my answer!
I heard him singing in the shower.
You remind me of the young me.
Tom's on duty tonight.
I'm always busy.
I play a little piano.
I thought you were a ghost.
Tom got up fast.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
Tom told me to stay in my room.
Rest is important.
Have you called Lucy yet?
A good idea came into her head at the last moment.
There's a lot of air in this room.
Why aren't you wearing a sweater today?
A pound is a unit of weight.
I wouldn't talk to him again if I were you.
Japan consumes a lot of paper.
It's very difficult.
You betrayed me.
Tell her I'm sick.
Tom seems very busy.
And I'm very pleased to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
There's nothing I can do for Tom.
Is that my book?
Washing is routine work.
Who else is on your list?
Don't give Tom my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I wish I knew what to tell them.
Tom's kids must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you should talk to them.
He's reading physics in Oxford.
He kept that fact from me.
Did you save me?
He snores loudly in his sleep.
What's your favorite browser?
Tom recognized Mary by voice.
You're not even looking at me.
Tom's too lazy to do this.
Please stop fighting.
Grandpa always said there would be days like today.
That's not what I told her.
I want to live in Australia.
No one could help them.
When did you meet her?
The day has come to an end, thanks to your timely efforts, the people who have tried to help you in your writings have not been able to put themselves in danger, and in the Theatre, the Masks are rehearsing a new pantomime.
After the earthquake, many decided to sleep in tents on the street.
Tell your men to drop their weapons.
There's a secret door in the library.
Mike has friends in Florida.
We both laughed.
We need three more chairs.
I like this office.
I have a friend who lives in England.
Tom's doing his best.
Why aren't you here tomorrow?
We should get to know each other better.
Someone said something, but I didn't get it.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I've never been worried about them.
Tom was able to get to the hospital on his own.
I sat next to Tom.
You sound upset.
Have you always been so selfish?
I think this medicine will be of great benefit to you.
Tell Tom to be here by half three.
It's not God's news. What a science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
It's gonna rain, I'm afraid.
Would you like a beer?
Where did you see him?
The poor cat was on the verge of starving.
I've learned so much from my mistakes that I'm thinking about doing a few more!
My favorite color is blue.
I made some corrections.
You don't know what you're talking about.
The football player hit the ball.
It's a good book for sale.
Tom didn't say anything.
I didn't know Tom wouldn't do it.
Positive atomic nuclei attract negative electrons.
You're so wrong!
Tom opened his bag.
Everyone looked at my legs.
Tom was the first one to arrive.
Don't help me, I want to do it myself.
I'm not feeling well.
Come here.
The hotel gave me an 8,000 yen bill for the room.
I stopped chasing fashion.
Tom's allergic.
I know this girl's father.
I don't know exactly what my kids want for Christmas.
Why would she do that?
Does Tom have one?
I finally got a job.
Tom's in the kitchen, washing dishes.
Temperature's down by three degrees.
Tom refused to let Mary go to the party.
Tom won't ask me to do this.
I want to be like him.
I'll never tell you.
The bus was overcrowded.
Where do you want to go next weekend?
How wonderful is that?
I'm hungover.
Tom wasn't polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car's good for sale.
I have work to do this weekend.
You can't do this to us.
His words embarrassed me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what Tom had to do.
Say hi to her for me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer shocked everyone.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom back?
I've got to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it at the store.
The world is cruel.
I'm having a sensitive dream.
No one cares but himself.
I'm from Shizuoka.
Tom burned all the trees in his backyard.
Saturday's the day he's free.
I wonder what happened to her.
Last bus leaves in 30 minutes.
He told me he'd do it.
He gave him a book.
Thank you so much for staying with me.
She didn't give me anything.
I understand.
He wrote to his parents.
I'm happy with what I have.
Why are you just here?
The postman's nice.
I want to know if Tom and Mary eat meat.
Tom wouldn't have listened to my advice.
Is there anything you want to say to Tom?
You don't want another son?
How can I lose weight?
I think we should tell Tom we're gonna be late.
Where are our friends?
Don't forget us.
They were trying to hide their anxiety.
There's a big organ in this cathedral.
I don't think you're right.
Did you find him?
You want me to come in?
Please drop me off on this side of the traffic light.
Tom shot and killed the tiger.
I've never met anyone higher than me.
How much does rusty flour cost?
I want to drink something cold.
What do you care?
Each nation has its own special character.
A healthy person doesn't know the cost of health.
Did I miss anything interesting?
I had to tell them myself.
The public was laughing.
You're not paying attention to me.
My ankle's broken.
You like to take pictures, don't you?
He's a noble knight without fear or reproach.
They hate women.
I don't have much change with me.
Tom tried to run.
What color are her eyes?
Hurry up!
You overestimate him.
How many weeks ago did this happen?
Tom slept in his room.
Do you know why this is happening?
I looked around me.
Tom's still alive.
Hawaiian is my favorite pizza.
Tom was a hockey fan.
Who was here first?
Are you singing in the choir?
Were you home last night?
I've been homeless for three months.
She said she wanted to win.
Prices will go down.
I'm glad Tom wasn't hurt.
I've never hurt anyone.
It wasn't an accident.
Don't blame yourself.
What do you want to talk about?
Tom's yelling at Mary.
It's my favorite song.
Don't leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
I thought Tom said Mary was from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very insightful.
Over and over in our lives, obstacles emerge, some call them problems, others talk about opportunities for growth.
Thanks for taking him fishing.
You won't have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with my friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog barking in the woods.
He told me he wanted to leave the company.
Do you want to come in?
You and I both know that's not gonna happen.
I thought you knew them.
Tom bought me a hot dog.
I'll be back late.
We need action, not words.
Tom was suspected of being a spy.
You're just running away from trouble.
A court without women is like a garden without flowers.
You can't leave the baby alone.
She'll do it if she can.
I'm done with this.
I put bait on the hook.
Don't leave your glasses on the table!
We sold our souls for money.
Are you working tonight?
The wind was silent.
I rarely met her.
I know it's really important.
I'm eating an apple.
Tom studies as diligently as the other boys in their class.
I'm not hungry.
Their job is to cook food for soldiers.
What happens if we get caught?
I can put things in a box.
I'm gonna clean up your bedroom tonight.
He speaks five languages.
Tom had a tough childhood.
I'm divorced.
How did you know Tom was sick?
I like the way you say my name.
Tom didn't tell me anything.
There's no one in this class that's as tall as Bill.
Shall we go?
I knew I could count on you!
Tom put wood in the fire.
“Love has never killed anyone.” “Are you asking Romeo and Juliet?”
What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It's like a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I shouldn't have let her go.
Tom died a year and a half ago.
I knew you'd come back.
These books are old.
Are we leaving yet?
Neither Tom nor Mary were ever in Boston.
Have you ever sucked?
If I had money, I'd buy a computer.
Tom smiles?
She went to Paris.
Tom's at school right now, right?
Let us know, please.
Tom nodded and headed to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove that I'm wrong.
I told you to stay in your room.
Do you have any pain anywhere?
He couldn't go because of a lack of money.
Let me explain how this works.
Open the door or we'll break it!
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't give up French.
I think Tom can be trusted.
There are many mysteries in life.
Isn't it too salty?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's an apple that's rotten.
Tom said he didn't have any money.
Boston is Tom's favorite city.
It's a shame when someone dies.
Are you feeling better?
What makes you think we might be interested?
I'll think about you every day while I'm gone.
That was a bad bet.
The thought of her walking alone was disturbing me.
The river flows smoothly.
He looks like Johnny Depp.
I've been watching them.
Do you really love her?
He gave a statement of the facts without comment.
He was dark green.
He'll definitely come.
Do you have a message?
Tom called me unexpectedly yesterday.
We really need this.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the glasses.
I've decided to give up.
An accident took their only son.
Everyone knows there's something new in this old capital.
I'm always careful.
I went to the market.
Did you bring a towel?
Tell Tom I have his keys.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Do we have a chance to win?
I knew I needed to stay home.
He understands French.
Tom got on a bus going to Boston.
When she fell, she hurt her elbow.
I'm sick.
We'll deal with Tom later.
You want to be rich?
There's a call for you.
I'm proud of you both today.
She doesn't like my way of speaking.
Mary wants another baby.
I don't care what you do with your money.
I'd like to see the boss.
Tom didn't drive to Boston.
You can't rely on the weather forecast.
She's still young.
Did you follow Tom's advice?
Tom says he's color-blind.
How's your father?
Did they say when?
This car looks angry.
Do you learn English?
Are you my enemy?
She asked him for some money for a new dress.
Why does the moon glow at night?
I couldn't understand anything Tom said.
You won't need this anymore.
Tom did it on purpose.
Let's think about it.
I know Tom wants you to do it.
Tom said he didn't know anything about the robbery.
Do you know everyone here?
Tom couldn't read until he was 13.
I prefer quail eggs.
She lives in Muhosransk.
Those people who aren't smarter than I am, I'm not interested.
Is this your first trip to Australia?
Owls are wise.
Tom asked for some water.
The loser had a break in all three sets he had given him.
I can't go with you because I'm very busy.
A kilo of figs costs two and a half euros.
Are there many animals in the zoo?
She's the pride of her class.
Among other things, temperature is the most important factor in this experiment.
It's better to have no meaning than no proposal!
What's he talking about?
I haven't seen Tom in a while.
Tom said he didn't want to sleep yet.
Which floor does Tom live on?
There are no direct flights to Bologna from here.
I live out of town.
Give me a few hours.
Don't make yourself eat if you don't want to.
I have a job for Tom.
"How did the accident happen?" "Nobody knows."
What do you like about him?
When I arrived at the station, I called a friend of mine.
I need to buy a plane ticket to Moscow.
We met last week.
Don't believe anything he says.
Tom's freed himself from his foreign accent.
We all knew it would happen sooner or later.
No one disagreed.
She's running.
It's a man.
If Icelandic was a color, I think he'd be white.
Do you know where the meeting will take place?
I wish they were happy.
I want to quit my job.
Christianity has many followers.
The carpets absorb sound.
Tom told me it wasn't possible.
This must be where Tom lives.
Tom's a weird kid.
The phone was invented by Bell in 1876.
I fell asleep on his shoulder.
I know you work a lot.
I love Ural.
I hope you're wrong about that.
Sometimes you have to tell the truth.
Tom's a pusher.
I have a proposition for you.
Did she like dinner?
I think Tom was crying.
Tom and I are planning to get married on October 20th.
If you want to be alone, I'll leave.
He's got a lot of talent.
He's in a bad mood.
What would you like to be called?
He's got a Japanese father.
Who would want to kill him?
I was in a hurry.
He says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he was exhausted.
He's sitting up late in the night.
Tom's room is very small.
Do you speak Italian?
The girl smiled at me.
This song is doomed to succeed.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them what we could do.
I'm proud of him.
I just got home.
Tom burns both wood and coal in his furnace.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We have to be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom left Mary his keys.
I talk to him all the time.
I can't help laughing at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God foretold the reconciliation of Christ’s royal power and priesthood.
You want me to talk to Tom myself?
Each of us went to his house.
It's thin, but it's strong and it doesn't break.
It's all kind of stupid.
At the moment, I don't know what I want.
That's incredible.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six to five in favor of TV viewers!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom's interested in biology.
She tried to kill him.
Was he really that bad?
Tell me where you're going to live, please.
They all need attention.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
It's Tom's voice.
Can we get Tom?
Tom said I wasn't pretty.
Do you cry a lot?
We did not expect such results.
I've read it before.
If the car breaks down, we'll walk.
Can I touch your hair?
Did you find anything interesting?
Everyone's doing it.
I often visit relatives.
He'll be expelled from our club.
You should be punished for what you did.
They went up the stairs.
She has to drink water.
It's one of the most ugly buildings I've ever seen.
The robber broke into the post office in broad daylight.
That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come too.
With God's help...
I don't like coffee too much.
My desk is old.
We're both very busy.
The darkness is imperceptible.
I get everything I want.
Are you happy to see me?
I'll pick you up.
Tom tried to drown himself in the bathtub.
Tom and I are the same size.
I said goodbye.
Tom is Maria’s younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes to play cards.
It's a big book.
Don't talk about Tom like that.
I think I made myself clear.
We've been waiting for three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Times can change, but human nature is still the same.
Tom looks pretty upset.
I brought some cookies.
Next year Tom will be teaching French.
I listened to her until the end.
I told Tom to rest.
Why does that make you angry?
The worst part of the trip is over.
We'll miss both of you.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in the shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you do that!
I could use that knife.
How do you know what I had?
It'll only take a minute.
That's a situation I'd really like to change.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to believe any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a squirrel in a wheel.
He never got through it.
Would you like to come with us?
Does Tom know how to swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We're planning on leaving as soon as possible.
He went skiing in Hokkaido.
"Shut your fucking music and read the book." "I see my censoring spell still works!"
You knew her better than I did.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no salvation for her.
I'm sorry I did this without you.
You're bleeding from your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants what you want.
We can't just ignore it.
Where did you and Tom meet?
Where's the supermarket nearby?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you're lying, join us.
Tom wanted to apologize to Mary again.
Tom was thoughtful.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He's never been.
I really wish I could come with you, but I can't.
It's never happened before.
I wasn't gonna do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Let's hurry up or you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary switched places.
How do they carry you?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful person, but I can't imagine what I'm capable of when my family is at risk.
Mary made Alice a new dress.
That decision was difficult to make.
I thought you'd be thirsty.
I got what you asked for.
He said he'd do it.
Tom didn't have to leave.
Mary recovered from her illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get this?
The eating of meat is harmful to your health and your environment.
You're telling me you don't know anything about this?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom doesn't know how to enjoy life.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
Nobody loves me.
I wish I knew Tom's phone.
"Tom knows." "Yes, did you tell him?" "No, he found out himself."
Your explanation was very understandable.
I slept the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I'm just sure you've just been thinking about something dirty.
The Sahara is the world's largest source of dust.
What do you like most about Boston?
I want to be alone.
They were waiting for the signal to start.
I told them not to tell anyone.
We have a lot to buy.
I read an interesting book yesterday.
Tom will pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is a weeping owl.
I don't have that book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is in the center of the solar system.
Are you a cop?
Tom failed both me and Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut myself with a razor.
Tom and Mary seem to be more than just friends.
The river irrigated the garden.
A strong wind shuts down at night.
Ants and giraffes are distant relatives.
Tom did it because I told him that.
I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need him.
Tom was carrying two suitcases.
Tom didn't seem to recognize me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Don't slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I used to go to bed early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom's in the office.
All Tom does is watch TV.
Tom's in a good mood tonight.
It's the most delicious pears I've ever eaten.
I had a parking problem.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do that.
It's not mine.
Do you know what this is?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
Tom's never been late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go ask your father.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each sheet.
It's hard to take you seriously.
Members of the tribe settled along the river.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When's the start?
No one cares what she thinks.
I don't think it's weird at all.
"Where did you get my phone?" "Tom gave it."
When are you going to clean the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Is there any point in fixing it?
Why are you locking the door?
Tom said he tried it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at 8 a.m.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You don't know how to write programs.
Change the subject.
I like to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's not tall, but strong.
It's cold this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Can you find Tom, please?
He'll give it to you.
This proposal is unclear.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
Don't you understand what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom's an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom divorced Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
It's an endless lesson!
This box weighs a ton.
He gets it because he's a butthead.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he's never met her.
It seemed like he was going to kiss me.
Don't yell at me.
Are you having fun?
I don't think that's gonna happen.
I'll order it later.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
This is our school.
I've been free all day yesterday, and I've been working today.
Take your coat, it's cold tonight.
If you think about it, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose your patience.
Why is Tom mad?
What a terrible man!
The cardboard is stronger than the paper.
Don't be mad at him.
You've exceeded your authority.
The curse was destroyed.
Tom's great-grandfather was born blind.
Tom's taller than you, right?
She hurt her back playing tennis.
Tom's easy to frighten.
This table is white.
It was a strange game.
I've heard about all your problems.
I've known him for a year.
I'm coming with you to Boston.
Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer, they went to a mountain resort.
Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.
Tom and Mary aren't afraid.
Can you come closer?
She's a little shy.
What do you expect Tom to do?
She seemed perfectly calm.
Press the button.
Tom went to the museum with Mary.
Tom was intrigued by what was going on.
Mary wore her boots to her knee.
That's a lie.
I'll keep an eye on them.
She said she had a cold.
The road inspector was very rude.
Tom wants to follow his father's footsteps.
I don't see a problem here.
I don't have to do this tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's awfully bitter.
Did Tom tell you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on the way to work.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Tom was first last time.
Everyone's different.
I need to see you.
I lost your phone.
Put the tree over there.
Do you usually wear a bike helmet?
Tom's gonna fix it.
Tom said goodbye to his sister.
Mother was busy cooking dinner.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
Little pots have long pens.
Tom was in sandals.
There's a bench under the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
What do you think of my story?
Tom turned off the alarm and fell asleep again.
Tom and Mary looked tired.
I heard you singing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?
Tom often plays guitar.
I tried to warn Tom.
The train was full.
Tom rarely wears a tie.
You bought too much bread.
He says he's not planning on going.
I have two dogs, three cats and six chickens.
Does Tom have cable?
Whatever you say, I won't change my mind.
Tom can talk.
Thank him for his help.
Tom could have told me.
It'll bring misery to your family.
I was very nervous.
Tom said I had to go.
I have to win.
It's useless to ask him for help.
Mary tried to sell her house.
You have to try not to sleep.
My mom's really helping me.
Tom's got a snake tattooed on his back.
You bought meat at the supermarket?
He hit me by mistake.
What's that dog's name?
Walk on the sidewalk.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's father is.
It's raining like a bucket.
The whole country is talking about it.

I didn't play tennis last night.
Let me do it again.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you convince her?

We'll do our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom's gonna miss the plane.
She always gets up early.
You want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We were sitting in the bottom of the audience.
You'll survive.
What did she buy at that store?

I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie before?
I know what you did last night.

Why did you shave your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How many pens do you have?
The black fork was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom talked first.
Did you tell Thomas to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he should explain to me.
I was very calm.
Everyone has something to hide.
We'll have a few guests tonight.
Her voice still rings in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time heals everything.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't lose the chance.
Why don't we have dinner tonight at the restaurant?
Some birds didn't fly.

What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?

Take them to the hospital.

She never answered him the letter.

What's the weather like?
I texted her.
You owe me $300.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
You're not gonna introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She cried.
I told Tom Mary to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living out of town?
How long did it take you to do that?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's leader.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone was screaming.
Which one's better?
We're grateful for your help.
Go to your room!

Give me a cigarette.
Do as you're told.
Please, look at this movie.

Did you tell Tom?
Me!

Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I made a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did all this.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
Only philosophy can use a vicious circle in evidence and be commended for it.
I can't afford to have kids.
When I spoke to them in French in Paris, they were just staring at me, and they couldn't get these idiots to understand their own language.

I'll open it.
It's been ten o'clock, my mother must be mad.

Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Kalo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming today.
You become a father, you understand.

Where did you take your shoes off?
We went to the beach.
Do you think it's gonna be Christmas snow this year?
How was Tom's party?
I have to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from one of my friends.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me as well.
I'd like a coffee.

I'll forgive him this time.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.

Come out now.
Can I see your license?
I'll charge you 1,000 pesetas to replace the lightning on those jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot his sweater.
Tom lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly where to start.
What a memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two concert tickets.
I should have gone to Australia with you.
Tom baked pancakes.
He's been dictating several letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you wearing your pajamas?
How much is it?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to take care of the garden.
A cup of rice weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I should have left Tom a note.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I've been waiting for Tom since half three.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary do it together.
Did anyone else notice that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom's kind.
She played the sonate.
You can write in any language you want. In Tatoeba, all languages are equal.

Does he know me?
I hate this place.
Someday you'll thank me.
Tom watches TV sometimes.
I'm ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I'm still not thinking well.
Run, chickens!
I had a terrible dream last night.
The net is huge.
I'm sick of you!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I only fell asleep after two o'clock in the morning.
Mary was not thirsty.
It wasn't as hard for him to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom.
They say that movie is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late for the heavy rain.
Apparently, she's healthy.
Tom was wearing a straw hat.
Keep an eye on your brother.
Tom said he wasn't gonna wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like bitter peppers.
What time do you usually get up on Saturday?
I put milk in the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There's no one who can't be defeated.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can paint.
They're dirty.
I didn't know it would be impossible.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snowing yesterday?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you measure it?
Does Tom speak French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put that back.
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
I was impressed.
I suggest you don't go.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the beast.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary in self-defence.
What is the difference between faith and trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you find out?
If the weather allows, we'll climb to the top of the mountain tomorrow.
She and I both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve a problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of God Ra.
Tom saw it?
The more I thought about the problem, the harder it seemed.
His gray eyes sparkled and sparkled, and his pale face was usually revived and covered in blush.
What kind of pizza do you like the most?
Tom stood in front of Mary.
Take more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands got blue from the cold.
You want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Typhoon destroyed a lot of houses.
This man was condemned to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you wearing my shoes?
The power is in Tom's hands.
I learned to study and play like my Japanese friends.
Why are you looking at me?
No one's gonna blame you.
I'm not busy right now.
Children like to play rather than learn.
They thought he was his little brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on talking politics.
Is it red or white?
We're not afraid of fighting.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Let's go!
Do it before it gets dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to this kind of job.
Bring your wife.
Are the mustaches suddenly in fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't want to waste that much time on it.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born the day before yesterday.
Tom's wearing a pirate suit.
That's the truth!
Let's go get the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom should be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll help you out.
We are proud of our achievement.
Tom should have invited Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought last night.
She's his sister, not the girl.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop hitting the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know this man is who he says he is?
King Harald Hormsson, better known as Harald Sinezub, introduced Christianity into Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last days have been very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't go to this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very talented and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read Herman Gesse.
To be honest, I never spoke Portuguese.
When criminal cases reach trial, it is generally accepted that there should be 12 members of the jury.
What exactly was Tom doing at the Australian Embassy?
Tom and I started dating.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very confused.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very acidic.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was going to do it.
It's been another day.
You have to do this right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He hurt himself when he fell.
We're impartial.
I have mosquito bites all over my arm.
Tom, hurry up, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you watching your weight?
Tom plays trombone.
You're from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald's is world-famous for his hamburgers.
Tom gave Mary a very expensive gift.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like these perfumes?
The lock's broken.
The diamond is a gem.
Have a cookie, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Stand down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want what's best.
Tom's a waiter.
It's gonna be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self - esteem?
Was it too easy?
What Alice was facing in waiting for an answer was a sudden swarm, it was a loud noise that was so sharp that it would break her drum pads, and it was so loud that it could reach the sky.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
You can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get her stuff in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked him for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, aren't you?
We need to hire him.
I was trying to solve the problem in vain.
You were supposed to do your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
That stone was so heavy I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
If he does, he will respond.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tasted banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we explain this to the children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed a tree.
The language I teach is very complicated.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Do you really live alone?
I told you I'd come back.
Tom's the youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President has been ruling for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Would you mind settling that?
Both Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
There's 20 floors in the building.
If you're not going, I'm not going either.
Do you happen to know when Tom's coming back?
I don't have pictures of Tom.
Can you wait a little longer?
Are you gonna give something to Tom for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would have been a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There's a strong wind coming up.
Tom didn't have the courage to try and jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time are you planning to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's stubborn like an ass.
I think I can count on you.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a feeling Mary was bringing her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say it again!
I called him, but some girl picked up.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom's very hard on the kids.
How's the negotiation going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got a little moustache.
Do you understand what she said?
You're a little distracted.
Don't piss her off.
I'd rather stay.
Tom came up with a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place safe?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and clean.
I suspect Tom has to go to Boston next week.
Don't walk in other people's land.
Tom was terrified to watch.
Tom's face is blushing.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where are you and Tom staying?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done here.
How do you like your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hungry for him was an abstract concept; he always had enough food.
We need a new curtain in the hall.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her legs hurt.
It's a risk we can't afford.
Can I talk to you about something important for both of us?
We need to get you to the hospital.
What's the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do it often.
I hope we don't do it again.
How many times have you helped Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, there'll be opening time.
I'm not sure what her size is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and walked into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as it stops raining.
Thomas walked away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire him?
He and I were crying.
Would you like to try again?
Wait a little longer.
Why are you dressed like that?
You can make butter, cheese, and so on.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug a well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her little daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an intruder.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He winked back.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
Have you thought about asking Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
No one's hungry but me.
Tom's very excited.
No snowflakes in the snowvale think they're guilty.
Who do you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.

I want to go out with him.
You let Tom down.
What are you doing in my room?
We miss Tom terribly.
He answered his parents.
Tom, have you eaten yet?
Who did you give it to?
I held him by the collar.
No one's asking you to do this.
I forgot it's April 1st.
Please stop singing that song!
Tom was bitten by a dog.
I know you left early.
Tom's been doing it all morning.
I'm aware of the consequences.
To the east and west, the city is divided by a river.
Why are you jumping?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
Was Tom scared?
Tom invited me to stay the night.
I don't think Tom's guilty.
I'd really like you to stay.
I'm impressed by your French.
We both want to do this.
If you heat the ice, it melts.
We could have done it.
The doctor said Tom needed surgery.
I just changed my toothpaste.
Here's something for you.
This is your bedroom.
Tom's realistic.
Who's knocking on my door?
When and where did you and Tom meet?
I've come to visit you.
I feel like an amoeba.
Our team came home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom married the older girl.
I listened to him.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Did he come to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you crying.
Show me how to do this!
Everybody's quiet.
Let the dust cool down.
Why are you so stubborn?
He fell in love with his Chinese teacher, but with all that hormonal stuff, he fell in love with almost every other person.
I am pleased to inform you that I have fully recovered.
I wrote a lot of esperanto sentences.
I like the aquarel better than the pastor.
I can't make any exceptions.
He's quick to understand.
I can find them.
I'm here right now.
You have the right to a lawyer.
Don't stay too close to the TV.
I wash my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't pass the score.
You stole it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father likes fishing, just like me.
Hey, it's me.
Dan has shown himself to be a champion of the superiority of the white race.
I'll try to distract them.
I like the color of your shirt.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom cooks better than I do.
He swims like an axe.
Tom didn't tell Mary what he needed to buy.
She brought the broom.
"Tom, hurry." "I'm coming!"
I have a big problem.
We're not partners.
We've had this problem before.
I'll try to say it in French.
I'm not like everyone else.
I managed to get two tickets to the concert.
He likes to brag about his father's successful car business.
She's wearing sunglasses.
Come on, Emilia, your father is waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of a computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Minus minus gives you a plus.
There's a dead body in the basement.
Please make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
There's nothing to tell.
I prefer to travel on my own.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I went to the bakery.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're great.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Jane's farewell speech saddened us very much.
I try not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look stunning.
I appreciate your help.
He couldn't stop his smile.
Wait a minute, did you say "girlfriend" or "boyfriend"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is learning what you didn't even know you didn't know.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should've thought about it before you made her pregnant.
Tom says he won't marry Mary.
I caught two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's pale.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is a friend of my father's.
Can I come too?
Does Tom make enough money to live in town?
The interview is over.
Please turn off the radio.
He seemed not sure of his answers.
I heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take your jacket off if you're warm.
There's so many of them.
He couldn't compromise his principles.
Mary says she's lonely.
It'll probably take you three hours.
It was an easy decision.
Mary said she'd be here early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
You still buying lottery tickets?
It could be anyone.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom is gifted with a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
It's about telling the truth.
I don't want Tom singing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I had nothing wrong with my mind.
Tom keeps his room clean.
These three books belong to Tom.
He jumped from one subject to another.
It's a truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's coming in.
It's not cold today.
I put Tom's shirt on by mistake.
Looks like the bank robbery was planned up to the details.
Tom didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.
Stay for a while.
I want to talk to you about something.
The can's empty.
Why didn't you show it to Tom?
Isn't the weather lovely?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I was swimming in the river.
Tell them to pick up the phone.
Can you tell us what this is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's a butcher, right?
Don't force me to kill you!
Which one do you like better, this one or that one?
They don't respect him.
There's no choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't make us angry.
You don't have to answer that.
Tom's got a lot of books.
Can you tell the alligator from the crocodile?
Wait, what's this?
My grandfather built this house.
You want to take this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a kid.
Do you really want me to tell Tom that you killed his father?
Your teacher called me.
I'm your father.
Can I do it myself?
All the people were touched by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous this is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower in the morning?
Okay, everybody, listen, please.
Is it made of wood or metal?
I'm sorry!
I think Tom's my friend.
In the hope of being ignorant and free, the nation is counting on something that has never been and will never be.
Tom barely breathes.
Dogs don't know the colors.
Tom poured water out of the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are the right animals.
Tom's house was almost completely destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Does Tom know you can't speak French?
There are two boats on the lake.
I won't give you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be alone than being in bad company.
That's the wrong data.
There's a notable difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom's lazy.
We have to tell Tom not to do it again.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's pretending.
Come closer.
We're staying at the Hilton Hotel.
That's why we should tell Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She kept complaining that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
Something needs to be done.
She gave him a gift.
Mary's in her room.
Attention, everyone!
That second, I fell in love with that language.
Tom's safe, isn't he?
Did you order this pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom's a close friend of mine.
Don't do two things at the same time.
You shouldn't have gone to the woods alone.
No one can see my tears.
Tom's asleep again.
She really likes you.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are repeated.
Tom's never kissed anyone before.
I'll tell them you came by.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
I almost forgot about the meeting.
They had a wedding last fall.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everyone knows we didn't do it.
I thought Tom had never been to Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five years old.
We complained to the manager about the noise in the neighborhood.
I'm not gonna let you do that.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need this.
Honesty is one of the virtues.
As soon as you meet a new year, you'll spend it.
The library doesn't have any books in French.
Any generalization is dangerous, especially this.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write that with a chiragana, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you like I do.
Behave yourself as old as you are.
Do you know how to juggle?
Did you kill your wife?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they weren't coming.
I can't stand the kind of animal suffering.
I think Tatoeba's slowing down today.
Sally made her brother clean the bathroom.
Mary's apartment is a mess.
The conference room is busy right now.
Potato chips are bad for your health.
Mine's not as good as yours.
I look forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He took a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's depressing.
Do you see a star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the rope!
That's what you used to say.
Tom says he's not hungry.
It's always been like this.
Can't we fire her?
The artificial satellite was placed in orbit.
I'm totally serious.
Are you sure you're sick?
It's too easy.
What would happen to our children if a nuclear war broke out?
I told them the bank wasn't working.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I'm very sorry for Tom.
There's nothing to tell me what to do.
The papers are on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know that.
Tom didn't tell us what he was so upset about.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
You have nothing to hide, don't you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The bill must be paid by the first day of next month.
My French is terrible.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
For me, Boston is a cold city, not like Chicago.
Tom was the victim of an attempted extortion attempt.
I can't speak for colleagues.
Tom lives far away from you?
Why didn't I die?
The argument ended in a fight.
I didn't take it, you can check your pockets.
Tom came in yesterday.
I'd like to give you a review.
You chose the wrong person.
They took a great risk.
We have a white cat.
Maybe you'll never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home last night?
If anyone can do that, Tom.
The meeting was canceled because of the typhoon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
There was a cart with mules on the way.
Tom speaks French to his grandparents and English to his parents.
I don't think Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
Tom wasn't easy to find.
Everybody's dancing!
I live with Tom.
That's where I met them.
You're not wasting your time.
Your problem is that you lack patience.
Several events marked the twenty-first century.
Stop doing this, Tom.
Tom said he didn't plan to do it.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told Tom to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said it couldn't be said.
He got out of bed.
Trains are on schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think it's impossible not to get confused in languages.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Will the exam be today?
What motivates you?
You gave Leila your computer.
Roll your sleeves.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom would agree to meet us?
They say anyone in America can be president, but I guess they're not.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first one on the list is Tom's name.
What else have you missed?
Mary tried to calm down.
What time does the train arrive?
What time does this train arrive in Boston?
You didn't see that?
You need to call me.
Tom never knew Mary and John were dating each other.
When I get rich, I'll buy a farm.
I made him cookies.
It's a neighbouring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You're not gonna believe what Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think about it.
Can you translate this into French, please?
Eat the cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd was growing fast.
Mary told me she loved me.
Tom told me what happened.
Cossie and get it.
I'll find her.
Have you thought about what I said?
I'm very sensitive to the cold.
We're looking for you!
She's loved by everyone.
Compare your answers with Tom's.
Tom's heart is weak.
Tom's gonna have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his overhead beard.
Did you see my dog?
Don't even try to do it on your own.
No one saw you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to come back.
We've already talked.
I can't believe I finally managed to do that.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry, the test is light.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don't know which book to choose.
Tom doesn't understand at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
It's a tower.
I'm gonna have to wait.
It was Sunday yesterday, not Saturday.
Does anyone here know them?
They're watching you.
How much time do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
We can do that.
He's aware of his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary's wearing a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks for help.
Tom didn't tell Mary that.
It's okay.
There's a lot of broad prospects in this town.
What are you talking about?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find the hotel.
She's not stronger than I am.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't force people to do this.
Let me carry it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I hate that color.
Are they sleeping together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still single.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
The neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She's got her faults.
I wonder why Tom would do that.
I think it's suspicious.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing Friday night?
Tom's not the only one out of Boston.
Will you back me up?
Why don't you like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
It's up to you to decide.
Are you ready to have some fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter's about to end.
The titles and awards mean nothing to me.
Where did you even find him?
The meeting took a long time.
I recognize you.
Did you have a good day off?
Tom drinks beer.
If you don't want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Bring Tom a drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Concentrate!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we're gonna get lost.
I can't call him at home.
You should have apologized to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy ran to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a cab driver when he lived in Boston.
Tom looks optimistic.
He's not going to buy a camera.
I did everything I could to help Tom.
I'll connect you to her.
She's got the highest scores.
Tom may be growing up.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color do you associate with your childhood?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom used the floor jack.
I'd like to lie down.
Give me notes or something.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight.
He'll be here today.
The cat's dead.
It's only half past nine?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's not safe to swim in this lake.
I cut my finger last night.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me today.
Tom doesn't look good.
She put her hands on it to warm them up.
Tom said he was glad you were back.
My car is covered in pigeon shit.
Tom doesn't know I exist.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Is Laurie home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I won't make that mistake again.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I convinced her to marry him.
I've waited my whole life for this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane entered the corkscrew.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any correspondence friends in Indonesia?
You may have to help her.
Mary passed out.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come to the concert with me?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd love to see you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do that for you.
"Hello," said Tom timidly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
They're running.
The road doesn't match the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new sentence as a message in a bottle, one day it'll be translated.
You won't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
He and I are soul mates.
I have a granddaughter your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She started learning in her new office.
Let us take care of this.
I assume you're sitting in my seat.
I was planning on doing it yesterday.
It's a little early to drink alcohol, isn't it?
My parents don't like my way of dressing.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
That'll be interesting.
I hit him gently and hard.
What's worse?
It's cheap.
Can I hold your hand?
It's green.
Tom heard a noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom's been up all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about cellulitis.
The series needs to start watching when all seasons are off!
Road accidents happen every day.
Where did you go skiing?
Did you go to the hairdresser's?
It's a depressing prospect.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the balloon pen.
The only way to find out what happened was to ask Tom.
I haven't slept in 48 hours.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Get lost.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's all take a picture together.
I failed in my exam.
Everyone already knew that.
You'd better go help her.
The football player made a huge mistake.
Are they coming, too?
She sleeps like a baby.
Tom forgot to let go of the brakes.
This song reminds me of a girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The explosion shook the whole building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hugged.
That's my cat.
Do you have any children yet?
Tom didn't want breakfast.
Tom likes them.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom's a presumptuous idiot.
It keeps me awake at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I guess you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom thinks it's a sin to throw away food.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place bends to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about this yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom wiped the whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's reacting.
That's the sweetest guy I've ever met.
How much did it cost?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I used to be.
Do you know that boy who's crying?
No one knew about that.
It's amazing.
He said he'd never do it.
The one who stole the pin will steal the cow.
Tom's not a good swimmer, is he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was only a shadow of himself.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to come with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
Things happen.
What day is it?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to accept me for who I am.
I'm just a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily on the lips?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he was coming with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I have to stick together.
I've only heard good things about him.
I don't work here anymore.
Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You can't match us.
I saw the car exploded.
The window's here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw away my Playstation.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
Stay still!
What's your favorite TV show?
Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you'll be lost.
I like to go to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son for me.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
The dog's yours.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell Tom I'm going to visit his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer put the courage in his men.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying something like that.
I don't know much about hunting.
It's the first time I've ever cooked meat on a grill at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why would they do that?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everyone knew that already.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe that's what she said.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw the way he looked at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom should be home.
She was who I thought she was.
Tom showed the police his driver's license.
I cut my hair every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's an apple that's sour.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalogue.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
You're taking a job at home?
According to mythology, Prometheus stole the sacred fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All passengers managed to get out of the bus before it set fire.
I want to help you deal with this.
You speak French better than me.
There are a lot of talented people in this town, but Tom is not one of them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We're taking the checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars flickered in the night sky.
I doubt Tom's gonna win.
"Oh, what can we do?" "As it says, only Link can defeat Ganon." "So what can we do?" "Good! I'll grab my sword!" "No." "Ah?" "Ah? "Mecha no!" "..." "This is an axe with a turtle." "No." "How about "Ah, my father?" "No." "What about smoke bombs?" "No." "Ah, hell no?" "Ah, what about this gun?" "Yes!"
Do you know who sings this song?
Is your watch going right?
I'll see you Sunday at 3:00.
I was at your wedding.
Tom barely knows how to swim.
You're good at it.
I met her on the way home from school.
I haven't read any of his novels.
Everyone knew Tom was dying.
Where's the hammer you used?
Tom wanted to learn how to read.
I'm going to Tom's house.
Ken couldn't remember his name.
She said she needed money.
Tom helped Mary fold the blankets.
A is a mass consisting of elements c, b and a
I'll be back by 9:00.
He's got diabetes.
We can deal with them.
I was just wondering if you had any experience you'd like to share with us.
Tom slept without a blanket.
Pray for us.
What kind of music are you listening to in the car?
That's what they told me three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French revolution began during the reign of Louis XVI.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get an invitation from Tom?
I want to swim at sea.
It's all up to him.
I met a classmate.
He's old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our city was surrounded by smog.
No one saw them leave the room.
Two big coffees, please.
We were talking about you.
What kind of music do you usually listen to?
Without bread, food is not food.
It'll snow tomorrow.
You should've stopped smoking a long time ago.

I always thought Tom was a close friend.
I'm the kind of girl who's more friends with guys.
Don't worry, I have insurance.
Tom will be here with me.
It's hard for my father to stop drinking.
No one's suggesting you do that.
He works for this company from Monday to Sunday.
Mary forgot to lock the car.
I'm old.
Tom left with Mary.
Tom started laughing.
I'll call Tom tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic abilities.
Who's his nationality?
Tom was in the same cell with John.
I didn't want to swim.
He drank a beer.
Nowadays, it's hard for a man to be... himself.
I'll never talk to him again.
Shh, wake Tom up!
I'll comfort my handkerchiefs.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm the new teacher.
They're all children.
She got mad and yelled at me.
Did you take your medicine?
The bunnies are really cute.
She doesn't trust him.
Time is on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
I doubt Tom's still mad.
You'll feel better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell burning rubber?
That's not what happened here.
When's your dad coming home?
I understand.
Tom pulled Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of the shower.
Tom's got a patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are single.
Tom will try to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom's snorting.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to the party.
Her hair's wet from sweat.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it weighs?
A flight attendant is a complimentary master.
Tom's married to Mary, right?
All the bench in the park was busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
It's working for me.
Vermont is located on the border with Canada.
He had to live in the same room as his brother.
I'm not an imbecile.
You're gonna fix it, right?

The dynamite was invented by Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to intervene.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go if you want.
I know you shouldn't do that.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've already spoken to this student.
What is the chemical symbol for methyl hydrogen acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
Tom needs to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do it.
Cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a janitor.
I respect his views, although I disagree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the middle of town.
Who sent you?
She tied his sweater.
I don't think Tom would want to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
Is it cheaper to call after nine?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use it, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
How long are you planning on staying?
We ate in a hurry and left immediately.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't drop anything on your feet.
Start every meal with the soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right across from me.
The calite was open.
I brought wine.
I'm not popular.
It's his first day at school.
I'm dying to meet you.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest a different strategy?
They're dead.
The apples are big.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
Is she singing?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's take the car.
You're interrupting me.
She wondered what his lips would taste like.
A good coach is training this team.
The tree's sick.
The train was detained because of heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What makes you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you eat?
Don't you recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning on doing it.
I'm falling.
I couldn't come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
Last year, she learned how to ride a bike.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Since it was winter, he didn't go outside.
While walking down the street, I saw a friend of mine.
How many houses are there on your street?
Elephant tusks are made of ivory.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"How's it going, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
Her mother tongue is French.
That coat's not the same.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married back then.
I bought this book.
Naiveness is his only positive quality.
My hobby is collecting insects.
Tom lived in Boston as a child.
I haven't eaten in six days.
Can I tell them that?
She's been quiet all day.
No matter what he says, don't believe him.
I'm moving on.
Tom and Mary hope that their next child will be a boy.
Mary's always very nice, and she's got a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies fall asleep under a lullaby.
This is the best restaurant I know.
You could learn a lot from them if you'd only listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
I'm sorry I upset you.
One who never left his country is full of prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when it snows.
Tom's helping his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I turned on the imagination.
I thought we could do that.
My mom didn't want me to drive alone.
I'm sorry, I misunderstood you.
You know what you're doing, right?
Machine translations can't be trusted.
She hit me, not him.
You wouldn't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
This river is full of fish.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
She and I are the same age.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms before?
The prisoner is released.
What did they say happened?
Could you leave the door open?
It'll have to wait.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my age.
Tom knows that what he did was a mistake.
Japan has a soft climate.
Check again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced a traumatized player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip went very smoothly.
It's inevitable that I'll go to France one day, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom's just pretending to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
It's not raining, we can open the windows again.
This has never happened to me before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was going out when the phone rang.
I don't have to take it.
Always give way to interference on the right.
We're being asked to introduce ourselves one by one.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can give you a ride if you like.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes more than a hot bath.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about that.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice is like a melody song of sirens for me.
How does it feel to be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like it.
My fingers left prints on the glass.
Chemistry is a great science.
I feel like my French isn't getting any better.
How am I best able to get a passport?
Perhaps you can help Tom.
Tom's the best drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom's been ignoring Mary all day.
Tom's got fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he doesn't have a choice.
It's still bright outside.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
It's my father's car, but it's gonna be mine soon.
Did you forget his name?
If I had time to do it, I would.
Do you see Tom's boat?
Is Thomas big?
This medicine will help you.
Stop making noise.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how busy I was?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I have no one to trust.
She's a fan of Sex in the City.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Be good with him.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you have to do this often?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing like a glass of beer after a long working day.
What happened?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How long will it take you?
Let's take a break here.
Are you wearing new shoes?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom said.
She made a grease when she saw the dog.
He's no better than me.
Smoking is strictly forbidden.
This peach is beautiful.
Can you see that?
Tom doesn't like it.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
Good work!
You used to say that yourself.
Here are some letters for you.
It is almost unthinkable that a scientist of this level would have made such a fundamental mistake.

He's very good at tennis.
She misled the students.
She said she was Canadian.

When were you gonna tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I filled the jar to the top.
Go straight ahead.
I'm too tired to think about it now.
What house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
What are we living for?
Will it rain this afternoon?
We know about her.
You could have helped us.
I don't drive often.
Tom doesn't like the end of the movie.
Just get inside.
Just apologize to him.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm sick of you two.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventures.
Tom's in the library.
Were you at school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you happy?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
Tomorrow's gonna be a big snowfall.
We decided to postpone the meeting to next Sunday.

Someday you'll get there.
Tom's good with Mary.
"You owe me money." "No, you don't."
He came up and got on his knees.
You don't have to go if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Tom did this for you?

He says he's rich.

I was drinking milk.
It'll snow tomorrow.
Isn't life wonderful?
When it comes to cooking, no one likes Mary.
You haven't been yourself lately.
Tom lost his leg in a shark attack.
I baked it for you.
We'll do it as soon as we have time.
Next year, I'll be three times older than you.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your stamp collection.
It'll take forever.
Tom's not much taller than Mary.
No one seems to know him.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
It's the fabric that's messing with your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's winter soon.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to.
Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.

I'm married now.
It was only a few times.

We want to rent an apartment in town.
They spoke French.
It's extremely expensive.
He's not singing anymore.
I didn't know what else to do.
They still haven't woken up.
Tom's a couple inches taller than Mary.

Your question is hard to answer.
You don't believe her?
English is the world language.
Sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told Tom to leave Mary alone.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for a job.
Why would Tom need a hammer?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
Things are getting worse.
I choose where to eat.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new car.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
She's naked.
I'm not gonna let you take my kids.
Don't give it to him.
Run or you'll be arrested.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom made it his rule to meditate every morning.
Did you check your calculations?
He tried to make up a short story.
A room without books, like a body without a soul.
Why did God hurt us so much?
What does your brother do?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you in years.
I visited Tony last night.
She's easy to impress.
You're old enough to do it yourself.
Aristotle thought the Earth was the center of the universe.
I wonder what Tom really meant.

I told you I was the best.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.

I'm not lucky!
I would never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He speaks Russian fluently -- at least that's what he told me.
Tom's a third-year student.
How long will you stay?
I'm not a woman.
She has a tall father.
The train was full.
The house is red.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
You know Boston well, don't you?
The orchestra started playing.
Mary was wearing a pirate suit.
She's not my wife.
Why didn't you mention it earlier?

He was born at 7 a.m. on 5 June 1970.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are twins.

I don't know who to consult.
Turn left on the corner.
Tom taught me how to do it.
We can do more than that.
Give me one, please.

What you said made everyone angry.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for 30 years.
She showed her talents.
I wish it was possible.
I'm guessing you can't do that.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
At the next school festival, Bob will play the lead role for the first time.
You have to stay in shape.
I've been scattering seed all day.
By accent, I knew he was American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Have mercy!
Tom obeyed.
Everyone in my generation thinks about it the same way.
I live for it.
Do you know how to ski?
The Duke owns many lands.
At least you had fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's getting better.
You'll feel at home.
It won't end well!

I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who's Norman Finkelstein?" "American Political Scholar."
Get out of here!
If it's not a house sale, maybe it's a new way to get to know girls.
Tom picked up a coin.
Why didn't you clean your room?
If there is no God, everything is allowed.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please fasten your seat belts during takeoff and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both like seafood.
I've been waiting a long time for this.
I rejected the offer.
Do you want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
It's gonna take me too long to explain why this isn't gonna work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build all this yourself?
I look forward to my summer vacation.
Can we say it differently?
It looks great from here.
Wooden houses are flammable.
Let's throw Tom a party.
The dog's still alive.
I go to university.
I know you lied.
The bed is very comfortable.
I'll make a report on it tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a slut.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait here for him to come.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know Mary's shoe size.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is Jose, we're friends.
You forgot to mention that.
We don't need this anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do it without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who set up the meeting?
I'm such a bad guy.
Tom wants to fix this.
I'm not going to have fun tonight, I have to get ready for class.
Mary was the only girl in a skirt.
What kind of bird can't fly?
This has to stop.

I hate spinach.
My mother's cooking dinner.
Tom's a pilgrim.
What can I do?
Her son's a genius.
I know you've seen terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's inclined to let his emotions go.
We were shocked to hear of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I didn't see you.
You're just saying the obvious.
He had cancer.
It's your own fault that this happened.
It's as accurate as a clock.
I know where you're going.
You're catching up on everything.
Let's move him.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing this.
The cleaning lady interrupted the conversation.
There's a cat on the desk.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're not limping anymore.
Tom was a heavy smoker.
Tom's wearing gloves.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to this weather.
I'm wondering who's gonna help him decorate the snowman?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in soul mates?
What's that noise?
My son has a hereditary disease.
It's disgusting.
Is that snow?
I'll call you back.
He put the glass down.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can marry your dog.
The best defense is assault.
She's getting married this fall.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it'd be easier.
Is there anything we can do to help you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When will you be ready to go?
Investigations began last year with the confiscation of the computer archives of a man from the German city of Magdeburg.
What's up?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What makes you think you can't?
We were on our way back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe this?
Thank you for your correction.
Are you crazy?
Stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get that scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom's sharpening his pencil.
Tom can't ride a bike.
I don't speak a caluga at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much money do you need?
Mary laughed to tears.
I spent $500 in one day.
Tell them to go home.
Put it anywhere.
They didn't make it on time.
It's 7:30.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who told Tom that.
Tom got up early to see the sunrise.
The dinosaurs were extinct long ago.
I usually climb the stairs in one.
Tom's had another year.
I'm near the station.
Tom's a very good boy.
Are you drinking?
You're from Boston, aren't you?
Put it on my desk.
Tom got out of the water.
I was very proud of it.
You were ready.
Do you know Tom's brother?
All lizards can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
I've got it all out of my hand today.
I asked them to stay away from it.
Tom only learned to drive when he was 30.
I'm glad he wasn't hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
The kitchen knife wasn't sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my pen knife.
Honey, I can explain.
You'll soon adapt to village life.
Keep the bucket close to the water.
You're not a kid anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We all got along.
The river is the deepest.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I've told you that a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
Writing words separately when they are to be written in bulk is a major problem in Norwegian.
What are you doing with the rest of the rice?
It's been ten years since she died.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Is there anything else you need?
We left shortly after that.
It's a book worth reading.

I like to learn other languages.
Mary has brown eyes.
I'd like to know how long Tom plans to stay in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
How did you feel?
Let's give Tom a chance.
I like fruit.
Tom lied.
He's a car dealer.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope not."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I ate caviar.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to make sure we check.
Tom gave Mary's gun.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They got on the bus first.
Let's wait till Monday.
Does anyone know them here?
There must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to the smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was your day?
It's your fault.
I told you what time to come.
Of course I kept my promise.
Our friendship has remained strong.
Have you ever spoken to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get to the point.
Tom was sitting on the stairs.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes lightning hits twice in the same place.
I'm not bragging.
Leave it for later.
Tom told Mary not to leave the door unlocked.
Tom blames Mary for John's death.
It's up to you.
Were you surprised?
We counted the annual rings on the tree we cut off and determined he was 30 years old.
I feel like I've known you my whole life.
I want Tom to never write to my daughter again.
Rabbits breed fast.
I don't want to talk about it right now.
What's the cost of cleaning your coat?
We'll paint it.
The hole is narrow.
I'm not afraid to go to the cave.
When happiness knocks on your door.
You need to listen to her.
I wish you knew how much you meant to me.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
Tell me frankly.
I'll come to whatever it takes.
Do you mind making another cup of coffee when you want it?
I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Honolulu.
You're not telling me anything I don't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom left last.
Tom signed the petition.
You tried to talk to Tom about this?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
We don't know much about Tom.
How was your day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me time.
