Semilarski v. Prosecutor ' s Office: the cassation of former Vice-President Tartu will be reviewed on 4 August
This means that it is likely to be decided in early September.
The courts of the first two courts refused to hear the Semilarski case, but in April his appeal was accepted by the State Court of Justice.
The Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant on 12 December 2019, as its authorization was not within its jurisdiction.
The court ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for damages in criminal proceedings.
“The Public Prosecutor's Office and the District Court are responsible for regulating such matters”, previously explained to ERR correspondent Anette Kreitsmann, Spokesperson for the Tartu Courts.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed the order to the District Court, which did not change the decision of the Court of First Instance on 5 February.
Now it's up to the State Court to say its word.
According to Semilarski's lawyer, Oliver Nyes's juror, his client was unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
He now demands that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office refute the false allegations against him and compensate him for the moral damage.
The reason for filing a complaint before the court was the statements made by the Prosecutor for Special Cases of Liuna of the District Prosecutor ' s Office of Margus Gross in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with the other Vice-President Tartu Artem Suvorov, was arrested on suspicion of having committed several crimes.
“Remember that, when I was arrested, the Security Police and the Public Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that Tartu leaders, one of the most influential bodies of local self-governments, were corrupt.
These public suspicions in the air accompanied me for about two years.
Now that these allegations and suspicions have proved false, the Public Prosecutor’s Office does not want to say anything about it,” commented Semilarski in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyaes, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor should operate.
"The allegation of bribery and corruption proved false, but it's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia as well as on Lithuania that during the investigation phase, representatives of the State should be careful when choosing words so that suspects would not be represented as criminals before sentencing.
The Prosecutor's Office also imposes a presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, has not been respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” says Nyaes.
“The public representation of Semilarsky as a serious offender and a briber in circumstances where the facts underlying suspicion of bribery are still found to be unacceptable, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the complainant”, added counsel.
As rus.err.ee wrote, former Vice-President Tartu Valvo Semilarski would not be prosecuted for bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, a former official is tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption laws in dealings of particularly large sizes.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in town management meetings in making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, whose owners or leaders Semilarsky actively interacted at the personal level during the off-duty period.
According to Gross, in all of these cases, Semilarsky had personal interests and therefore had to withdraw from decision-making.
Previously, as rus.err.ee wrote, the Public Prosecutor's Office had suspected Semilarsky of taking bribes and violating anti-corruption laws in dealing in particularly large amounts.
This occurred in October 2016, when he was arrested with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
At that time, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both Vice Mayors.
Since then, both officials have resigned.
The Suvorov case later reached the court, which fully justified the policy.
The trial of Valvo Semilarski is still under way.
The ex-soldier of the group, Hands Up, visited Tver oblast.
The ex-soldier of Hands Up, and now a solo performer, a businessman and actor Sergei Zhukov posted a photograph from Kalysin Tver oblast in his official instagram account.
Photo published a day ago, Saturday, July 25th.
"Hold my hands up under the new Baby and say hi from the drunken, fresh air!
Would you comment on the weather in your city?
We don't have rain today, but it's not going up to the top of the 20s yet,' writes Zhukov on social media.
Perhaps the singer rests in the beautiful city of Tver region with his family.
The residents of the region have already thanked the perpetrator for his visit and have expressed hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new "Child" in the post is probably in view of the new version of the old song that Zhukov now recorded with the blogger and musician David Manukian (DAVA M).
But most fans stay for the old version, "Sergey, the old version of the song is 1,000,000 times better!
Support me for the loyal fans of Hands Up, "We don't need a new baby."
Most people write it directly that the original, which became a hit at the time, is more like it.

The US called on Qatar and its neighbours to put an end to the dispute
There is a need to restore confidence and unity between Qatar and other States, as the United States Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook, believes.
He stated that the conflict between the Emirate and other countries in the region had been going on for too long and was detrimental to regional interests in the areas of stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the US has tried unsuccessfully to mediate a dispute that Washington regards as a “threat of efforts to contain Iran.”
Diplomatic relations with Qatar broke up three years ago with the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain.
They imposed a transport blockade accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, in Doha, the neighbours said that they were simply jealous of Qatar’s economic success – according to IMF data, Qatar had been leading GDP per capita for several years.
The Emirates is the third largest natural gas reserve, the sixth exporter of natural gas and the major exporter of petroleum and petroleum products.

How the decision of the CB to lower the core rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to lower the key rate again.
It went down another 0.25 percentage points, up to 4.25% of the annual, formally another historical minimum.
Judging from the return of the short step of the reduction, as well as the tone of CB statements and the updated forecasts of the Russian economy, the regulator looks more optimistic about the economic prospects than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy easing can soon stop.
“We continued to relax monetary policy, especially given that there are still risks of declining inflation from 4% in 2021”, reported the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvir Nabiullin.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
According to Nabiullina, economic recovery will take more than a year and a half.
She noted, however, that, following the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes had recovered: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand had recovered, construction and production of consumer goods had increased, and the annual rate of decline in transport and production had slowed.
According to an updated forecast by the CB, the economy will decline from 4.5 to 5.5 per cent in 2020 (previously 4 to 6 per cent) and the economic recovery in 2021 will grow from 3.5 to 4.5 per cent and from 2.5 to 3.5 per cent in 2022.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
The CB had previously expected $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia’s 2020 inflation forecast was 3.7 to 4.2 per cent, compared with the previously expected 3.8 to 4.8 per cent.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, bringing us closer to the end of the easing cycle, and the economists for Russia and the CIS consider the Renaissance Capital, Sofia Donets and Andrey Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has consistently lowered the key rate over a year, and since the beginning of last summer it has fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the CB reduced it by one percentage point because of low inflation due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate a retarded economy due to the pandemic and its associated constraints.
The chances of a monetary policy fixing remain (at the next meeting on 18 September until the end of the year), but the limit is near, agreed by the Chief Analyst Rosbanka Evgeniy Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflation risks also indicates the proximity of a pause in the mitigation of interest policies - broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to prevention measures and a faster (than expectations) recovery of demand, he said.
In order to complete the Bank’s follow-up actions, Koshelev points out that more attention will be required to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased in the context of geopolitical conflicts.
In one way or another, lowering the core rate will lead to further lower rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as perhaps on a mortgage, says Maxim Petronevich, a senior analyst at the opening bank.
The rate adjustment would be less pronounced than the reduction in the core rate, he clarified.

Survey: The ruling Union of peasants and Green Lithuania once again led party ratings
The Union of Farmers and Green Lithuania, which leads the governing coalition of the Seimas, has led the ranking of the parties.
This was shown by a poll conducted by Vilmorus Sociological Research Company on the order of the Lietuvos rytas newspaper.
After winning the parliamentary elections in 2016, the "crusaders" lost their first place and long led Russia's chief critic in Lithuania, the opposition "Front Union - Christian Democrats (Conservatives).
However, recently, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, in assessing the electoral capabilities of the parties, stated that the Union of Farmers and Greens, after this year's parliamentary elections, is likely to be able to form the coalition again.
This statement provoked the resentment of the conservatives.
The latest survey showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 per cent of the voters and 17.2 per cent of the conservatives would vote for the peasants.
According to Director Vilmorus Vladas Haydes, the break was within the margin of error, and yet the rulers were no longer behind the conservatives.
According to Haydes, the sociological success of the “crusaders” was facilitated by the news that Prime Minister Saulius Svernimis would lead their electoral list.
This politician was first on the list of "crusaders" and in the 2016 elections.
Third is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 per cent of respondents are now ready to vote.
She suddenly lost 2 percent for a month.
The fourth is the Labour Party headed by a businessman of Russian origin, Victor Uspasky (6.2%).
The rest of the political organizations, according to the poll, will not be able to overcome the 5 per cent electoral barrier.

The authorities of Podmoskovya reported on the fate of closed landfills
Solid household waste areas continue to be closed in Podskovje.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are being upgraded to modern landfills.
But this option is not possible for every site, and many of them have grown to a dense housing development.
Once the range closes, it rises on the reclamation, the body of the range is overburdened with soils, gas-freeing systems are installed and infiltrated.
This means that the chemical processes inside the landfill can be stopped so that they do not ignite, stench, soil and groundwater.
And then the former dump stays standing up in a useless pile of housing that's been around it.
Why don't you make it useful?
For example, in Rouse, where the Annano field was just completed the other day, the authorities are considering the option of making a ski slope from a pile.
The site, which was operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown beyond the boundaries of the land allocated to it.
Therefore, in the reconstruction, it was necessary to buy neighbouring areas that had been de facto filled with garbage for a long time.
"Sometimes it's gonna pass, the ground's gonna sit down, and the fortresses will come, and we'll think about what we can do to make it work.
"A ski resort is very obvious," told the head of the Russian district, Nikolai Parthenov.
Two sites will be renewable energy sites
The Torbeevo polygons in Lubertz and Timohovo in the Bogorod district will be sites for the extraction of renewable energy from landfill and biological gases.
At the end of the year, a gas-pumping power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeeva, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt hours of electricity per year and an estimated 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy that will provide for its own needs - heating of administrative and manufacturing facilities.
Timochovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt hours and will continue to operate as a waste-processing complex.

The beautiful high minarets only decorated Aya Sofia.
One more time about Aya Sophia, there's a text about Vladimir Zelinsky, which, like, needs to be protested.
First of all, there's a free entrance.
I haven't been to Istanbul, but the house of God is better free than paid.
Secondly, the Muslims won this land as honestly as Orthodox conquerors conquered the Volgo-Ok Circuit, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apples on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Are we going to give it back to everyone?
You don't think there's any Gentiles who'll ask for their house back, where the Tenth Church is?
Thirdly, the Muslim people improved the building and invested in it.
I mean, it's just like the factories and the estates that the Leninians took from the bourgeois to their property are owned by the Lenin, Putin and other nomenclatures.
They've improved everything from the Kremlin to Angara, so they're all right progressors.
The beautiful high minarets have adorned Aya Sofia, very much.
It was a stupid ink, it was a stupid ink with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no “Islamic” or “orthodox” civilizations.
Some of them are believers, some are hypocrites, and some of them are hypocritical.
A believer in the categories of civilization doesn't think.
It's the thinking of a British MIDA Toynby official, a believer who's ashamed to think like that.
And to a believer there is a place of prayer.
Always.
The believer does not pray except where he is asked to leave, but turns to another place and prays there.
He's a believer, not a defender.
We're splinters, not rash rocks.

A Russian show actor responded to the charges of "LGBT propaganda and feminism"
An actor from the Russian show "Chiki", whose creators were accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism", responded to a complaint for the film.
The authors “understood the sharpness of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone”, said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in an interview with the issue of The Rise.
"I think it's a story about power and common aspects of human life.
This has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said the actor who played the father of the boy, who changed into women's clothes.
He stressed that he was proud of his work and did not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he was frightened by the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in a deep-skinned gun shot the set and said that it was not true."
"A couple of times then we met some disgruntled locals who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who first came forward with grievances began to help us,” he summed up.
The shooting incident, explains the publication, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balqaria, where a drunk man attacked a camera crew vehicle with a gun, after which he was arrested by police officers.
It has previously been reported that Olga Baranets, the Public Commissioner for Family Protection, filed a complaint with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor for the service More.tv, which posted the Russian TV series "Chiki".
The Baraner accused the creators of the series of "promoting non-traditional sexual relations and feminism", pointing out that the film's main characters work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "the scenes of physical and psychological violence".
The Ombudsman was also outraged by the fact that “the series pays much attention to homosexual sexual orientation” of a minor character.
Chichi's comedy drama tells of three prostitutes who started a new life and started business on the advice of a friend.
