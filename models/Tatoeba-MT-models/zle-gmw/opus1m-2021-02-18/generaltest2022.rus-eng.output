From my point of view, the literature program was formed by Balzakov women on the basis of their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote the belleletstics, of course, from the point of view of those Balzakovian ladies.
And psychology and the torment of Tolstoy and Turgenev's heroes are not so interesting for teenagers.
Adolescents are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Micropacket Prestige: Comfortability and natural composition.
The mattress has different rigidities: the medium-strong surface is made up of latex coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft, a natural latex plate.
A spring block of 1,000 springs per square metre is rapidly adapted to the body of the sleeping one, warning that the effect of the wave or the gamma will occur.
Among the merits of the model are breathing materials.
The latex, perforated for airtightness, is ventilated perfectly naturally, as is the coconut coke.
As a result, a healthy microclimate of sleeping space is maintained.
The mattress is also subject to an extended guarantee period.
The official guarantee from the manufacturer is five years, and the life of the mattress is longer.
The protection against dust and pollution is assigned to a removable jaccard cover supplied in a kit.
Buy a pair of orthopedic pillows to the mattress; it's recommended to maintain the optimum position of the spine during your sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - the coconut provides anatomical back support, the latex relaxes the muscles.

With horror, I remember these tablets and guests at my parents' house.
The guests are on the doorstep, and the cookies are still on the stove, and the mother is poking the floor.
Oh, my God, he's been sitting at the table already.
And then I'll wash the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday, you bring food, two days of cooking, day of cleaning after.
What about the guests?
They're fine, and they're gonna have cake with them.
Since then, I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I'm making a small table.
And I make them flavories, and I bake them all the time for nothing.
Germany: A fourth inoculation against the coronavirus is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will take place in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed force.
Despite an intensive vaccination campaign in Germany, no two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be sufficient to fully protect.
This is the conviction of the head of the Ullrich Weigoldt Association of General Practitioners.
This is reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11.
"We expect a fourth vaccination to take place in the summer, no later than autumn," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigoldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccine can be carried out “in combination with influenza vaccines”.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccinations can help to combat the spread of the new strain of the Omicron coronavirus.
The new option is particularly dangerous.
For example, the probability of re-infecting Omicron is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is evident from a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
On this basis, BioNetech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide the vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new version of the Omicron coronavirus.
A study by BioNetech and Pfizer showed that at two doses of vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: “neutralizing capacity is reduced by more than 25 times.”
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against omicron-stam infection," stressed Bionetech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is needed.
Experts are insisting on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, the President of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favour of reducing the interval between second and third inoculations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccinations will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
“The experience of Israel is very convincing,” the expert stressed.
Wobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibs by what was originally designed to be used for ice fishing, and not just for fishing.
These vibrations have a greater weight than those of similar sizes, which undoubtedly has a positive impact on the nuances of these interesting baits.
Another recognized feature is the top fins of solid and elastic plastic, which produce additional vibrations with vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter-ass" catch, Bet-A-Vib shows a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy thing is a simple monotone animation, that is, the movement of the oar up and down is almost without pause.
In planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient for catching in a limited space, swamped by underwater vegetation, coils and other obstacles for which a lead is possible.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant for fishing for the winter of the tusk and the large gum, especially in the middle of the winter, when a point-and-aggressive bait is required.
After reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib immediately rotates and returns to the reference vertical.
Bet-A-Vib has also been used for the winter catch of pond trout.
To satisfy her whims, two modifications can be made: with or without a noise capsule (NS – NanoSound).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib game has the potential to irritate a passive peacock that doesn't even react to a living person.
When caught, Bet-A-Vib shows range and accuracy.
This vobulaire is understandable and unchallenged, well combined with the leash and weave cords, even large diameters.
In order to catch a squirrel, a sculpt, arch or a buckle, except evenly, and a step, sometimes with a squirming down the floor.
If you are caught in industrious places, you can change the front triangle to the double, which reduces the probability of leads.
Among the baits of his Bet-A-Vib class is one of the most resilient and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
With the same success, it can be used in relatively small and relatively deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, 7,000 Russian mercenaries were declared
More than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company Wagner are present in Libya.
The President of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled Al-Mishri, announced this on Sunday, 12 December.
“There are currently more than 7,000 mercenaries in Libya who have been hired by Wagner.
They also have aircraft.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Coofra.
They have 30 jets on Gardabia airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte) " , cited by Anadolu.
Khaled Al-Misri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries were “trying to seize” the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after “taking their man to power” in the Central African Republic.
Save Presence
According to the interviewer, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “deployed in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufra, as noted in the Agency's publication.
The Russian authorities have officially denied that the Kremlin has been supported by Wagner.
Where else mercenaries might be
According to the Agency, Wagner is believed to be active in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection for leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Vagnera's subsidiaries are granted certain privileges and licences for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of arms, technology and military services to these countries,” the article states.
According to the media, the Wagnerians allegedly fought in Donbassa, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan and the CAR.
The group is not listed in the security agencies or in the law enforcement register, and its fighters are not listed in the uniformed personnel lists.
This company is under US sanctions.
In the past, 27 EU countries had previously approved reforms against Wagner.
The EU Council is expected to adopt this decision on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second House of Parliament with consultative functions with the dominant Islamists, writing by TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting on the election of members of Parliament and the Head of State from 24 December at least to February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left before the elections, and the chances that they will pass on time are rapidly declining," notes the material.
Against this background, the Libyan High Electoral Commission postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates and broadcasts Sky News Arabia.
Foreign Politics With Russian Eyes
38% of Russians see more success in their foreign policy than failure, 29% believe that failure predominates.
"Examples of success - "in Syria, protected, restored peace there," "the Northflow 2 solution," "the whole world intimidated that the cool weapons," "The Crime we pushed away."
The main setbacks are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “isolation from the world”, says a study by the Foundation for Public Opinion.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned the paperwork, and all government services have become digital too.
The Government of Dubai reported a complete phase-out of paperwork and a transition to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively electronically to the public.
This is reported by the Emirat news agency WAM.
“Today marks the beginning of a new phase of digitization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government”, said the Crown Prince of the Emirate, President of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rachid Al Maktum on Saturday.
Internal and external documentation in all Dubai institutions will now be digitalized only through special information platforms.
The innovation has affected all sectors without exception: health, GKH, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial entities have also joined the Government ' s initiative.
The transition to e-government and the digitalization of documentation began in Dubai from 2018.
During that time, the authorities estimated that 336 million paper sheets had been saved, amounting to 14 million hours of human labour and $353.8 million in cash equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow mayor Sergey Sobian stated that e-services save citizens two days a year.

Turkey ' s automobile production and export fell below 2020 levels
The production and export of Turkish cars declined sharply in November, as lira depreciated.
As a result, industry performance for 11 months was worse than last year, reports Bloomberg, citing data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were manufactured in Turkey in November, 20 per cent less than the year before.
Some 75,000 cars have been exported, more than 25 per cent below last year ' s figure.
While Turkey’s car sector has shown positive momentum in the first 10 months of this year by last year, the 11 months of 2021 have already turned out to be 0.3% worse than last year’s.
The reason for the fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November was 29 per cent relative to the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 UXO entities received a loan deferral in 2021
The first Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smaïlov, described the situation with regard to the granting of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, transmitting to MIA correspondent Kazinform.
“In accordance with the information provided by the Agency for the Regulation and Development of the Financial Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan, this year, pursuant to the instructions of the Head of State of 1 April 2021, the Chairman of the Agency issued Order No. 127 of 9 April 2021 approving the Procedure for the Deferral of Payments for Small and Medium-Sized Business Entities”, Alihan Smaïlov wrote in his reply to the Parliamentary Request.
He recalled that the deferral of loan payments by banks and microfinance organizations provided for the deferral of payments of loans issued prior to 1 April 2021 to HCM entities, including PEs, between 1 April and 30 June 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the subject of the HCM.
The borrower's application may have included a different period for deferring payments.
During the period of deferral, claims were suspended, notice of the need to settle outstanding debts, as well as commission charges and other charges by the lender”, noted the Vice-Premier.
In 2021, the second-level banks received requests for loan deferrals for 603 UXO borrowers, of which 553 UXO entities received a deferral of 9.7 billion tenge.
The IFI has applied for a deferral of 131 UXO entities, of which 95 entities have been granted a deferral of 105.8 million tenge”, concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily carry the strain of "ocmire"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity could carry it more easily than those with strong body defenses.
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the strain of the coronavirus "ocmire" could be dangerous.
It's worth looking for when the virus is born.
Scientists believe that the “ocmire” was born in the body of a person infected with HIV or suffering from immuno-deficiency.
I mean, when he mutated, he didn't find any resistance to immunity.
That makes him more aggressive.
Because of the lack of an answer to immunity, he became very fast.
Apparently, he's got these spike squirrels, spikes, maybe more than proper, their antibodies not cut off during mutations, commenting by Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity could carry the "ocmire" more easily than those with a strong protective reaction from the body.
Turns out the body's strong response to anything, any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's what happens in pneumococcal infections, when a 30-year-old dies and old 60-year-olds pass through it in the form of a sneeze.
The young man's immune response is rabid, and he's completely inadequate: where he can only threaten with his finger, he hits like a sparrow cannon, and he concludes Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs can be bacterial and viral.
If the first one is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to buy only symptoms - all the hope of the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there's respiratory symptoms: breathing problems, an eyelash in the throat, coughing.
Pains on the right or on the left, abdominal pains can also be evidence of an evolving problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, a growing generation of 12 to 18 years may begin to vaccinate by the end of the year.
The virusologist, the head of the IFTI genomic engineering laboratory, Pavel Wolckov noted that this category is highly affected by covid.
Adolescents who go to school have as many contacts as possible.
It's the most socially active layer, like kindergarten students, said "Moscow 24" by Pavel Volkkov, a virologist, head of the IFTI genomic engineering lab.
The author’s greatest thanks for this article.
I'd love to refresh my memories.
Teath-In.
In those far-away '70s and '80s, no dance scene was without the tunes of this group.
At home, they would dance with their friends.
Immunologists hypothesize why obese people are victims of a cove.
The authors examined the fat tissue remaining from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipocytes could be infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in fatty tissue, macrophages, have also been infected, with severe inflammatory reactions.
Scientists also examined the fat tissue of patients who died of covid and found particles of coronavirus in the fat surrounding the various organs.
HIV and influenza viruses are known to hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid a response to the immune system.
It's probably also possible for SARS-COV-2.
Biologist explained the causes of dementia
A candidate of life sciences, Semen Goloshakin, described the causes of dementia and how it could be prevented in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is manifested by the gradual loss of cognitive functions, which, in time, is difficult to navigate even in a familiar environment.
Holoshakin noted that neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and lack of certain vitamins are the most common causes of dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of disease development.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, social exclusion and lack of active cognitive activity could play a role”, he said.
Dementia is also affected by harmful habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and low-moving lifestyles.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decline in abstract thinking.
“There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor,” added the biologist.
To prevent the outbreak of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of fistrading, cognitive skills and abilities that require memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of FGAOW WRNIMU.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the cognitive breach department of the Federal Brain Centre and Neurotechnology, Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned some 30,000 illicitly removed artifacts
Over the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has succeeded in returning some 30,000 artifacts that have been smuggled out of the country.
On Saturday, 11 December, Al-Hayat was broadcast by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has recovered 29,300 artifacts.
It was only this year that 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C.," he said.
Abdel Gauad clarified that all artifacts smuggled were registered in the archives.
Department staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, professionals “trace auctions around the world and Internet sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites as well as social media.
The Chief Inspector explained that cultural property was restored upon return and then displayed in museums.
According to him, one of the recovered artifacts was the ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find Pharaoh Tutanhamon's bench sold at an auction in London.
On July 4, Christie's Auktion House held tenders that sold over 3,000 years of age for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused Egypt’s dissatisfaction.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutanchamon, depicted as the sun god of Amon, has been stored in a private collection and has not been tendered since 1985.
How the relic came to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has actively sought the repatriation of illegally removed antiquities at different times.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological searches of black diggers.
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and that's right, because Crimean Tatars (232,000) are independent people (near the Turks).
If you want to add more, only 42,000 people -- so many Tatar people live in Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of that people is two words!
Only a Turkic language group brings them together.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal staff mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writing Financial Times.
In Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communications devices to its employees, but instead offers a discount for the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a telecommunications partner.
According to current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees as they are used to deal with business matters with colleagues or clients.
The bank exercises the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if the staff member used them to meet with a client that was not approved by the Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have gone to remote working conditions, the bank wants to extend this rule to all the devices that have been used to deal with working issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline for staff to familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Esenin's life - 1925 - was productive in creativity, but the worst for the Earth's poet's existence and his ego.
He's already out of any literary association, he's broken up with imaginism, he's on his own, but he's known, used, and sometimes he's a strong critic, even angry, but the reader's ready to wear it in his arms.
Over 60 poems have been written in a year, many of them masterpieces, the "Persidian Motives" cycle, the "Anna Snegine" poem, eight books, the "Soviet Rus" compilation.
And the main success is that at the end of June 25, the State concluded a treaty with Jesenin to publish his essays in volumes three.
No poet has ever been honored by any of the modern-day Sergey Alexandrovich, he's the first!
In addition, it was very good money, with a fee of 1,000 roubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 roubles per month, an engineer 200).
The funds that year were needed more than ever.
Jesenin married the granddaughter of Tolstoy Sofié Tolstoy, who had to set up a family home, support Katya and Sasha’s sisters, as well as a mother.
It seems that life has been built up, something to be happy about, but for him, it's mostly colored into dark tones, like the Black Man nightmare (written in November 1925 and published after Jesenin's death):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where that pain came from.
Is the wind fluttering?
Over an empty and deserted field,
Like a plant in September,
It's brainwashing alcohol.
Many acquaintances pointed out that Jesenin had given up a lot, looked bad, apparently sick.
There's been more and more hiccups, more nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis of alcoholism was made by Sergei Alexandrovich, there were no valid documents left.
Let's say, in May 1923, when Jesenin, at the insistence of her fourth wife, American women Icedora Duncan was improving their health at a clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gunnushkin (again Hesenin will come back to him two years later, already in Moscow).
But the evidence of the poet's singing, the scandals on the ground, the police's being held in police custody is quite abundantly scattered in dozens of memoirs.
From the beginning of the 20s, a terrible novel of a poet with a green snake developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Jesenin settled for a short time with a friend named Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Jesenin, with his very good income, never had his home in Moscow or Peter, found him in rented apartments, hotels, or acquaintances.
The elders remember:
"He only came to sleep, and in most cases he was insane, drunk.
One day, returning at 4 a.m., Jesenin fell on the stairwell...
When he fell, he scratched his face and snored.
When he regained some consciousness, he coughed constantly, spattering all the sheets with blood."
And Jesenin himself, after traveling through Europe and the United States (there was a dry law at the time, but Duncan took with her a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I didn't see anything but hogs and streets...
I'm at the end of the day, and people don't remember...
Well, I've been drinking, of course...
And I drank because I was bored."

Promtex-Orient 100x195 Duet Latex Economy
The Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom is a modern performance of the budget model in the prize class ruler.
The base of the mattress is the block of independent double springs Duet.
A softer spring of small size is inserted inside the large spring.
This allows the load to be evenly distributed to the mattress.
On both sides the mattress is filled with artificial latex.
It's the analogy of natural latex, but it's more dense and less expensive.
The flexibility and elasticity of this material increases the comforting effect of the mattress.
Artificial latex hypoallergenic, it doesn't absorb moisture and dust.
The mattress would be fine for a pair with a large weight difference (30 kilograms).
With smart springs, there's no wave effect when a light partner rolls on the side of a heavy spring.
A nice, soft-fashioned cover from the practical Jacquecard Sense is covered with a synthepon layer.
Natural tissue does not accumulate static electricity.
It is possible to make this model of mattress in a twisted version (vacuum roll).
He's almost 16 now, and he hasn't been tempted to fool around for a long time.
All the energy is aimed at choosing what he's going to earn for himself.
He's a lot more responsible than I was in his age, or my husband, who had problems with the law until the wedding.
A father takes care of his young daughter.
And he likes, as the Lermonts wrote, "wrong love."
Why did the girl cry at the exam before she failed?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't school?
She'll have a tail.
So what?
He will.
Millions of students know that.

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that Belarus uses migrants as “arms” against the EU
The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus uses migrants as “arms”
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pavel Yablonski, expressed the view that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had used refugees as “arms” against the European Union and intended to return to such “operation” next year.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Jablonski, the sanctions against Belarus were temporarily “stopped by Lukashenko”, but he is“ actively seeking new ways”.
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many places in the world”.
As Kp.ru wrote, the European Union had previously introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It addressed 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they expressed their willingness to further expand restrictive measures against the Republic “unless the situation improves”.
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not on Senka's hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man laugh
The secular events of 2021 were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first person to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
As early as September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and a traditional Bondian butterfly.
He was followed twice by Prince William, who first gave the Eco Award of The Earthshot Prize an inappropriate royal dress code green velvet jacket, and then chose a more classic version for the Royal Variety charity event.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was applied to itself and Lionel the Messiah.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in Dolce & Gabbana's velvet jacket.
By the way, his sons were wearing the same clothes.
AliExpress has already noted a growing demand for men's velvet jackets in Russia.
According to the analysts at Gaceta.Ru, they were purchased 1.4 times more.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with silhouette and silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, baard, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is between 3,000 and 6,000 roubles, and men prefer to buy only jackets, and they choose less velvet suits.
It's not just online truthers who can buy them.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the suite segment, the velvet jackets are presented in almost all brands this season - both Brioni and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which it appeared at the premiere of the film "Gucci House" by the massador of the brand Jared Leto.
By choosing expensive stamp jackets, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
A special thread binding technology produces a dense fabric with a porous external texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but are therefore less.
Mode expert Lamoda Ilya Vahoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, it's not his model or phase, but his relevance.
"Barhat requires evening light, so this jacket is perfect if you're going to a party or a solemn event," Wahshkin explains.
Another important criterion that allows for a choice in favour of a velvet jacket is the buyer ' s status.
"The man in the velvet jacket, first of all, has to have the right advanced party with the means, "the Telegram-Canal of the Man's Beauty Brammell." "The owners of the velvet jackets are usually castes of people who rarely buy tickets.
They're just invited to side events where the dress code is always shown.
Ilya Wahoshkin proposes to combine a velvet jacket with the same outfits: classic trousers with arrows, one-ton shirts, silk ties, loofers with brushes, garbs.
Too simple and everyday things would look inappropriate.
The fashionable experts at Brambell's Belle are convinced that it would be inappropriate to have a private employee in a velvet jacket on the corporation, but if it is a "man of the executives of this event, "yes, he's a thing of the subject."
If an employee is lower in rank and his goal is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to get financial bonuses, it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate it with the phrase "not on the Senka hat," the Telegram-Canal editors believe about male fashion.
There's a very mixed sense of voice.
It's an unnatural tembrae, it's so tedious.
And it's completely not associated with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money-- alternative energy is good lobbying, that is, paying.
Billion investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy was also out of line – both gas and oil and coal were cheaper to buy than they are now selling.
There's a wild demand for fuel.
The penny's dripping.
Then who's out there?
As usual, a private buyer.

It's just mediocrity within average passengers.
Perhaps if such characters are so confident of their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole wagon, they won't be able to do it, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautiful" people, but not because of their appearance.

The immunologist stated that re-inocination in four to five months would help protect himself from the strain of the coronavirus "omicron "
Revaccination in four or five months can protect you from a new strain of coronavirus infection.
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kruckov, who called the vaccination six months later, given the emergence of a new strain, “a very long period”
"In previous strains, this period was normal, but now it's best to do the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases in four," the expert said, calling for a re-inocination parallel to the vaccination campaign.
Hookkov also noted that early re-vaccination provides a good titre of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has been vaccinated with two vaccines and a bouster, or is sick and vaccinated, or vaccinated and sick, then he has received "hybrid immunity," i.e. antibodies, many and neutralizing enough," the expert explained.
The G-7 warned Russia of “scaling consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
The G-7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States) issued a statement on the outcome of the meeting of the heads of MFA in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia's “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have enormous consequences and will cost a great deal” in Moscow, but the specific measures are not described in the document.
“We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine”, states the statement.
Ministers further urge Russia to “reduce the escalation, use diplomatic channels, and abide by its international commitments to transparency of military activities”, as US President Biden spoke of during a video call to President Putin of the Russian Federation on 7 December.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandian format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine”, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the G-7 also state.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price in return,” they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as to the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine ' s reserved position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response,” the statement also states.
Earlier this afternoon, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Trass, stated that Russia would suffer “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, the meeting showed “the single voice of the G-7 countries, which account for 50 per cent of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have enormous consequences for Russia”.
Pfizer vaccine was considered 32 times less effective from omicron-stamp.
The vaccine against the omicron-stam coronavirus is 32 times less effective than the rest of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, transmitting South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original version of Sars-Cov-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against omicron-variousness," said Professor Malik Peerys.
In doing so, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe current of the disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had previously predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic in view of the impact of the omicron-stamma on it.
The study concluded that the omicron-stam could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality unless additional measures were taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine accused the Federal Republic of Germany of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the Government of former Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev ' s acquisition of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that Germany had vetoed last month the purchase by Ukraine of anti-sniper systems and rifles to kill drones.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later softened its position with regard to rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
These include the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
The FT notes, however, that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholtz on the authorization of arms transfers to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany, Andrei Melnik, expressed the view that Kiev should not expect Berlin to supply arms to Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German leadership attributed its refusal to provide arms to the risk of the military escalation of the conflict in Donbassa despite the “occupation by Russia” of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same "unlogical" position, I'm sure the diplomat will retain Germany under the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelenski stated that Kiev was awaiting assistance from Berlin in equipping the marine fleet.
In Ukraine, Germany is expected “to be Ukraine's technical partner”, added the President.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, Robert Habek, co-chair of the German Green Party, visited the Republic, where he advocated for the sale of defence weapons to Kiev.

G7 warned Russia of responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine.
The G7 Foreign Ministers warned of “serious consequences” for Russia if it continued its military aggression against Ukraine, as stated in the final statement of the parties.
The meeting also noted that it condemned the rise of Russian armed forces at the borders of the country.
“There should be no doubt in Russia that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs”, states a statement published on the British Government's website.
The G7 Ministers and the EU High Representative noted that “they are united in their condemnation of Russian armed reinforcement and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine”.
The head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Elizabeth Trass, at a press conference in Liverpool, warned of “greater consequences” for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
G7 wants Russia to renounce aggression against Ukraine,” she said.
Earlier at the Liverpool summit, the G7 Foreign Ministers agreed that the parties needed to return to the negotiating table to resolve the crisis because of the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine.
It was a "Norman-style" negotiation.
The North Atlantic Alliance also advocated dialogue on Ukraine in the “Normandian” format.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Maria Zaharaova, stated that, in urging Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries were “prescribed to be unable to take responsibility for their own mistakes”.

Means of recovering stolen money from Internet stores have been discovered.
There are several ways to recover money stolen through Internet stores and not be the victim of fraud in the future.
They were discovered by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
For example, in order to reduce the risk of large losses when bank card data fall into the hands of intruders, it is recommended to store fixed assets on a map or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
Some savings can be deposited into the savings account and withdrawn as necessary.
Experts also recommend that a separate purchase card be established for online purchases.
If the money was stolen from shops that do not use 3D Security security technology, it is possible to start a recovery procedure.
“In accordance with rules established by payment systems, unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure are attributed to the participant in the calculation chain who does not use the service”, the representative of the Prom Link Bank clarified.
The expert from the international payment provider Ecompay, Arthur Zaremba, stressed that the buyer had the right to file an application with the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the perpetrator used an online map that does not require two factors of authorisation, the transaction can be challenged and the money returned.
It is noted that, in some cases, Internet shops themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been shipped.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Chamber, Catherine Mizulin, Director of the League of Secure Internet, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 cases of fraud, ranging from the sale of forged documents to the the theft of personal data, had been received.
She said that a single window for online fraud complaints could be an effective solution in the current circumstances.
Scholz has come to Poland to discuss North Flow 2 and EU legislation.
The newly elected German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, came to Warsaw to negotiate the crisis with migrants at the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops at Ukraine's borders and the situation of the Russian North Flow-2 pipeline.
Although Scholz has expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries have expressed clear expectations from one another.
The Prime Minister of Poland, Mateus Moravecki, stated that he would encourage Sholtz to oppose the North Flow-2, which was intended to bring Russian gas to Germany bypass Ukraine.
According to Moravecki, Russia can use a gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, for its part, supported Poland ' s efforts to halt the flow of migrants attempting to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party “Law and Justice” violated EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation took precedence over EU regulations.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not make a public commitment to halt the work of North Flow 2 in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told Congress members that they had reached an understanding with Germany about stopping the gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, and announced on Tuesday a senior U.S. Congressman.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violated Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by the representatives of the G-7.
Dimitri, look closely.

The MC wants to give writers residences.
The future Russian Literary Support Fund will be handed over by the State to the federal property that remains to be inherited from the Union of USSR Writers and the USSR Literary Foundation.
At its base, writers' residences will be established, and the Parliamentary Gazette in Mincifra has been informed that it will be the founding member of the foundation.

Doctors warned of the risk of long-term use of hemorrhaging after COVID-19 and before vaccination.
Doctors Irina Yartsev and Sergey Tokarev warned of the risk of uncontrolled use of blood-reducing drugs after having a coronavirus infection of COVID-19 and before being vaccinated against the coronavirus.
The therapist, immunologist Irina Jartsev, said that self-prevention of possible clot formation after COVID-19 could cause a stroke.
Jartsev explained that the blood-reducing drugs were not intended for everyone, only if the patient was hospitalized, in hospital, and had complications.
The doctor appoints anticoagulants (blood-reducing drugs, obstructing the overproduction of clots) on the basis of evidence.
She reported that there is now a blackout - everyone drinks anticoagulants for a long time and gets complications in the form of haemorrhagic strokes (blood to the brain).
URFO's chief preventive researcher, the scientific director of the Society of Preventive Medicines, Sergey Tokarev's doctor of medical sciences, in a conversation with URA.RU, said that Russians now use anticoagulants indiscriminately and often before vaccines against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe in questionable advice on the Internet and begin to self-medicate.
There are citizens who decide to take anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And in a pre-inoculation examination, doctors notice bruises.
He stressed that it was extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the cause of any symptom.

The money we found in the church wall will pay $20,000 to the plumbers.
The plumber who found the money in the church wall in the U.S. state of Texas will receive the award.
This is reported in a press release by a non-profit organization, Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where pastor Joel Austen preaches, promising that godly Christians will be rich and prosperous.
In November 2021, a plumber, Justin Caughley, renovated one of the church toilets and found thousands of bags of money and cheques in thermal insulation.
He gave it to the church and said he didn't even get any thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could do," quotes KPRC-TV.
The discovery appears to be related to the theft that took place at the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
About $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in cheques that were stored in the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any damage.
However, a $25,000 reward was announced for information about criminals.
Justin Caughley could not claim that amount because the award had expired.
Despite this, a non-profit organization, Crime Stoppers of Houston, which in due course made an award of $5,000 and later received an additional $20,000 in a gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's integrity.
He'll get $20,000.
It was previously reported that the police had questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the Lakewood church wall.
Tanya, what she says, what she does, that's her characterization of "like a real man."
That's why the attitude is so negative.
And it's not that "she's financially richer than all writers," as they write.
There are people who are richer, but not everyone is as arrogant as this lady.

In Brazil, citizens were obliged to submit vaccination passports on entry
In Brazil, Judge Luis Robert Barros of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) ordered the entry of a covid passport from the State.
CNN Brasil reports this.
Citizens who have anti-impensive vaccines are exempt from the vaccination certificate.
The list of exceptions also includes those who come from countries where the lack of a vaccine has been proven.
“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, Precarnival and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in the flow of turf”, observed Barrosu.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities had imposed five-day quarantines on unfeeled tourists from coronavirus infection.
Full protection scheme against COVID-19 is open
A virologist, a doctor of medical science, and a well-deserved Russian scientist, Anatoly Altstein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, revealed a scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and using a solo vaccine.
Internal use produces a large amount of immunoglobulin A. This does not occur when injecting a vaccine.
Immunoglobulins A protect the muscular, so the virus can't get into the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins of G (antital).
And if you inject both vaccines, you'll get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's not yet a solution for a double vaccination," the medical doctor said.
In turn, URFO's chief preventive physician, Dr. Sergei Tokarev, stated that the main advantage of using inoculation together with injection is the ability to stop being COVID-19.
He added that this would help to ensure that, in such a case, the protection of the body was supposed to be maximized.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhgorod region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
He said that that was the case in other countries, where another wave of pandemics had arrived earlier.
Inna, um...
I've been talking to the doll for a long time. If you're willing to change a warm house, a feeding house, sweetness, love, and games for a leaky bitch, then go ahead.
But the pesel was trained and smart.
He chose my company and went home.
It's a video method that works in 90% of cases.
It's not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I've slowed down many owners to keep the dog from running after them, although they've been waiting for them to run away, and I've got 200,000 people running away, right by the hand, and I've taken them the other way.
In the end, "200,000" chose the owner, not the dog who ran out there.
In Europe, massive protests of vaccine opponents continue
More than 40,000 demonstrators entered the streets in the Austrian capital, Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against covid compulsory.
From February next year, unfavorable people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
The Spanish, outraged by the health policy of the authorities, conducted a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some of them held posters saying, "This is a false pandemic," "I'm not going to vaccinate."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital city of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, covet certification is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports had been taken by the authorities in several regions of the country against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action started peacefully, but then it turned into clashes with the security guards.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
Law enforcement officials responded by using water wells.
Nikolai S., even Wikipedia doesn't agree on this.
Kashevarova-Rudaya is also labeled "the first Russian doctor, the doctor of medicine," probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve this title.
Only one thing I agree with Zachariah is that the Americans carried only death and pillaging to any country wherever they appeared.

WHO has found “omicron” in six dozen States already
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that a new strain of coronavirus “omicron” had already been identified in 63 countries.
Several experts have already said that the spread of the new strain can have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported in a WHO report.
According to the organization, as of 9 December, 63 countries had already identified strains in all six WHO regions.
This is because it has only been widely distributed since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new version of the coronavirus.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain, based on preliminary data, can be bypassed by the degree of distribution of the Delta strains, the Indian version of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all countries without exception.
Prior to that, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Hebreyesus, stated that the omicron-stam could have a significant impact on the progress of the Coronavirus pandemic.
Similar findings were also reached in Britain.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the "omicron" will replace the "delta" in the coming months.
And the number of patients in Britain alone will be about 1 million, with the official "omicron" currently suffering from several hundred people in the Kingdom, and estimated to be up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from an omicron strain, and more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals every day at a peak.
What the British health system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "omicron" strain is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
The way the Russian satellite V reacts to the "omicron" is not yet known, and this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaley Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the amicron strain.

Curious Squirrel, you're right, Internet communication is different, communication is easy and unnecessary, and there's nothing to say in person.
And seeing a person in person, maybe it wasn't what you expected, and it didn't touch it, so that's where the attitude comes from.
When you meet your man, you'll change your mind.
And again, Soviet time is called the time of demons.
People then believed in God much more honestly than they do today.
In fact, they were raised almost by God’s laws (love of neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What an ideology today is money at all costs.
Chattons like Globe have little faith (no faith at all), but even so, the time of demons came in the '90s...

In Brazil, seven people died as a result of the rains
At least seven people died and 175 suffered from heavy rains that struck the north-eastern state of Bahia and its neighbour, Minas Gerais.
This is reported to the TASS with reference to rescue services.
At the border of these states, an extratropical cyclone has been raging since mid-week, bringing the region to a level of 450 mm. 25 municipalities in the state of Bahia have declared a state of emergency, some of which have become the most devastating flooding in 35 years.
A few bridges, two river dams, have been destroyed, and three tracks have been blocked.
According to the rescue team, some 5,700 people were homeless and another 6,700 were forced to leave their homes.
More than 85,000 people in the region were affected by the damage caused by the disaster.

$135 billion went into apps -- Hi-Tech.
In 2021, the cost of applications increased by 25 per cent worldwide and the number of downloads by 8 per cent.
The most popular in the world were the various video services.
The most downloaded video editor was CapCut, and most spent on YouTube.
Both the number of downloads and user costs of applications showed a significant increase between January and November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8 per cent to 140 billion. The cost of applications increased by 25 per cent to record $135 billion.
This data was published by App Annie, an analytical company that reported on the market for mobile applications in 2021.
In 2021, the world economy emerged from the locdown and began a post-pandemic recovery.
“Will such a “return to physical” slow the growth of the application economy? None”, the authors believe.
India has been the leader of the downloads of applications, accounting for about 20 per cent of all downloads.
It is followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of iOS gadgets continued to spend more than users of Android: iOS accounted for 65% of the total cost in applications.
Among the applications, CapCut's video editor was the first downloader in 2021.
It is followed by two Indian apps: a MX TakaTak video service and an app for Mesho's online trade.
The top 10 also includes Telegram.
In general, according to the number of downloads, VPN services (their top 10 two VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and video production and broadcasting services (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, the top 10 services include two more such services - Moj and SnackVideo).
"Most users spent on live broadcasts and online stripping apps," notes the report.
Youtube leads here, and the top-5 user costs also include TikTok, Disney+ and HBO Max, as well as a Japanese subscription service for Piccoma manga.
Telegram, Instagram, Zoom, and TikTok are the first active users to use each month, and the top-5 mobile version of Microsoft Office is closed.
In Russia, AliExpress's shopping application was the leader in the number of downloads per year.
It's followed by Zenly's service, which shows the location of the friends, and still the same CapCut.
The top 10 applications also include: StarMaker's online caraoke, Shein's online dress striker, Maps for Minecraft PE application, DiDiDiDiDi taxi service online, YouTube Pure Tuber client, Dixie Riteller application, and Samokat online store.
Throughout the world, people have adapted to the pandemic through the transition to life in the mobile, which is one of the main conclusions.
The industries that helped people to get closer, both virtually and in person, were the most successful,” commented the report by the head of the Apple Anne Marketing Research Department, Lexi Sidow.
The profits from the mobile game sector reached $90 billion in 2021. The number of downloads has been casual and hypercastic games that have little or no story, and video production is minimal.
Top 3 of the world's most popular games included Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DYY are leading games.
==Prognosis==App Annie previously presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends of the following year, the company’s analysts called the rise in TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the increase in popularity in the Z generation of financial applications, such as those for Robinhead investors, and the further increase in the popularity of metaversive mobile games.

The Russians were warned of a new scheme of fraudsters
The intruders started looking for new manoeuvres for video fraud.
It's written by "The News" with reference to experts.
According to the Director of Products of Ivideon Zaura Aboulimov, the main danger associated with the dissemination of video communications is dipphei.
In this case, fraudsters are creating a fake video based on actual recordings involving the victim.
As a result, neurosetics are able to accurately replicate the behavior of a person.
Aboulimov added that by using the dippheic, intruders could call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video with a copy of the person for blackmail.
“Such forgery can easily trigger a bulling, because a misguided intruder can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudoscenarios”, the expert said.
The leading system engineer, Varonis, Alexander Vetkol, in turn pointed out that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of video technologies.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that all of this was bought in a small town where the local mentality did not allow you to wear too much makeup and to walk in short skirts, to show stockings and panties on your legs.
It's a province, but it was a product in the store.
In the big cities, Muslim women also painted and showed their legs.
And so in Dushanbe, it's a big city, the capital of the Republic.
There's a lot of uniforms, and there's no makeup.
Five actions listed to avoid diabetes mellitus
The problems with blood sugar are among the most common in the world.
Some, however, do not attach much importance to this, and it is in vain.
Sugar diabetes can lead to severe complications and even death over time.
Preventive interventions play a key role in preventing the formation of diseases.
For example, doctors recommend a change in the drinking regime - a reduction in the quantity of various beverages and a shift to conventional water - have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods increase blood sugar levels to dangerous levels when over-used.
So the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The disease is affected not only by malnutrition but also by habits.
In order to reduce the risks of diabetes mellitus, much movement is needed.
Experts advise you to keep low - carbon diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce the weight, but it will also protect you from abrupt fluctuations in sugar levels.
Many cells must be eaten to protect against diabetes.
The food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to a sense of saturation, digestive juices, and increased eating habits.

Dr. Pavlova told me about the day-to-day migraine at the workaholics.
Several factors can lead to a deterioration of health on weekends
The reason for the deterioration in health after workdays is often the “migrene of weekends”, explained by a well-known medical doctor, a doctor in medical science, a senior researcher at the Faculty of Basic Medicine of the MGU, and the scientific director of the Zuhra Pavlov Hospital of Systemic Medicine in his telegramme.
She said that workaholics, who suffer from headaches, brokenness and weakness during the weekend, are particularly affected.
Dr. Pavlova noted that, in addition to the accumulated fatigue of the week, there are enough objective reasons for the body’s negative reaction to changing conditions.
On weekends, our lives are changing dramatically.
"We sleep long, we lie on the couch all day, we probably eat more, and we drink less," the doctor argued.
Because of overeating and lack of water, it's heavy and broken."
An additional role is the late recovery.
So if you get up three hours later than usual, there's a reaction called the jetlag.
It comes from travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which factor plays a decisive role in the deterioration of health, Pavlov recommended that we see what changes most during the weekend.

Scientists in South Africa stated that Pfizer's vaccine against the "omicron" was not effective.
In South Africa, Pfizer's vaccine against the "omicron" was said to be weak.
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported that Pfizer vaccine against the omicron-stam of coronavirus infection was ineffective.
It is estimated to be 22.5 per cent effective against infection with symptoms, and therefore... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is questioned, according to a study published on the MedRxiv portal.
Experts explained that the drug could save the disease from a severe current.
Previously, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the omicron-stam of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemics in Britain with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How many hidden sugars are used to food?
Sugar is not a good source of nutrients.
Its excess in diet can lead to type 2 diabetes and may lead to cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should bear in mind that an unknown word in the product may indicate hidden sugar, an ingredient similar to that of calorie sugar, composition and glycemic index.
Several dozen names may appear on the label, essentially indicating sugar.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fruit.
There may also be other dried sugars, such as dextroza (sugar from maize), leftulosa (fruit sugar), melassa (black patch), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates, which are mono- and disaharides, and they can be not only in pastry, but also in ketchup, doctoral sausage, bread, etc.
The most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and to the many different names of sugar.
The different types of sugar are different in taste, but whatever the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or untreated, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is difficult to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since not only the amount of sugar specified by the manufacturer on the package must be taken into account, but also that vegetables, fruit, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance to the German Federation in 25 years.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports were losing importance to Germany as the country continued to decarbonize the economy.
Germany, he said, planned to completely phase out gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years, the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role," said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to be committed to the transport of Russian natural gas by Ukraine in the future, as this resource is now important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement expressing Berlin’s support for Ukraine’s energy transformation.
Previously, the head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Annalena Berbock, stated that the process of certification of the Northern Flow 2 pipeline was ongoing.
According to the Minister, the coalition negotiations and the negotiation of the coalition treaty stated that European energy law should apply to energy projects.
The Diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline was “not yet in accordance with the EU requirements”.
Thank you for the interesting pictures!
In 1985, I had to travel to those parts.

The hackers hacked the Indian Prime Minister's Twitter
The hackers hacked the Indian Prime Minister's Twitter account, Narendra Modi.
The intruders were able to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legitimate payment and that it had already purchased cryptovalite.
Modi's office has been asked to ignore new messages.
The premier said that on Twitter, they reacted quickly - access to the account was restored.
India’s premiere’s page was already hacked in 2020 and was encouraged to make donations to the foundation by means of cryptovaluts.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, a majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted in a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third ballot was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51 per cent (2,755 persons) voted in favour of New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49 per cent (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90 per cent, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians voting.
As France-Presse commented, “the origin of these elections has left no room for doubt”, as the supporters of independence called on voters not to vote.
As the proponents of the referendum, they opposed the holding of the referendum on 12 December, considering that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago was preventing a full and “honest” campaign.
This lack of participation thus paved the way for the third victory of French New Caledonian supporters, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence and 53.3 per cent in 2020.
According to the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last ballot and will challenge them at the United Nations.
On Sunday, 12 December, the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, was reported to be expected to speak at the Elysé Palace on the basis of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence has greatly revived the recent weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates were in favour of keeping the Territory in France, as it was “the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific Ocean”.
“New Caledonia must always remain French,” Eric Zemmour repeated repeatedly.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate Valerie Pecress, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, encouraging the Caledonians to remain French.
For its part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position “because it's not his responsibility”.
Nevertheless, the President added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia”.
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed “the strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be France's choice”.
Lights, oh, hi!
I'm a little... a little bit humbling, still embarrassing, embarrassing.
Thank you for not turning your back on my channel.

Just remember that the food was natural, so obesity wasn't as widespread as it is now.
But medicine was zero-- leeches, garlic and cooking.
They'd be on their feet right now.
And the food has nothing to do with it.
Turkey experienced the world's first laser weapon drone
Turkey has successfully tested the world's first laser-weapon drone.
Eren drones were tested at distances between 100 and 500 metres, reports Mir24.
The machine is capable of neutralizing explosive objects at a distance with a laser.
The maximum flight height is 3,000 m.
After the relevant tests, the UAVs must enlist the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy explosive devices without the involvement of deminers.
The Agency stresses that Turkey is among the six countries in the world that are capable of developing and producing their own drones.

WSJ readers criticized an article on Russia’s and US relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell in which he described his vision for Russia and the United States.
The author expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrificed Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and allowed a number of offensive remarks to be made against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of Hartwell called on the Western countries to “join a united front against Russia”.
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There's quite a lot of false information in this article," the RIA News quotes from one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to lose it, and Ukraine is not our land.
The US and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine,” said another.

An earthquake with an earthquake of 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands area
An earthquake with an earthquake of 5.2 occurred near Shikotan Island in Curil.
It is noted that the epicentre of the earthquake was 231.8 kilometres north-east of the city of North Kurilsk.
The cavity was located at a depth of 92.5 km.
Previously, seismologists observed an earthquake of 7.5 in Peru, affecting 10 people.

Ukraine will start producing new-generation jet drones.
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish factory, a type ANKA drone (UAV) will be launched.
This was reported on 11 December by the freelance adviser to the head of the Ukrainian President's office, Alexei Arrestovic.
So they're capable of acting against air objects, against other drones.
Even against airborne pilots.
They'll be wearing Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: hull and so on," quotes his Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA ' s vehicles, the arrester said that they were jet drones rather than piston drones.
According to him, it's a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which are beyond his "all characteristics."
The first shipment of drones was due to be produced by the factory at the end of the following year, and arrested him.
The ANKA aircraft was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the day, the Ukrainian General Staff secreted data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during the military operations of the combined forces in Donbassa.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, reported that the construction of a modern military drone plant had begun.
He said that Ukraine intended to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence entered into an agreement to build a centre in Kyiv province to train personnel and to test and maintain Turkish Bayraktar drones.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum "a great real step forward."
Two lions escaped from the container at the airport.
At Changi airport in Singapore, lions escaped.
This is reported by The Streets Times.
Two predators managed to get out of the container with seven lions arriving on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were going.
One of the runaway lions lay on the roof of the container.
The animals couldn't get away from him because of a nearby protective net.
The opposition ended with the arrival at the airport of Mandai Wildlife Group, which runs all Singapore zoos.
They have demobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and are planning to take them to a quarantine facility.
In Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, it was previously reported that the lion had fled the landlord and was walking the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast came home voluntarily, and no harm was done to the people.
Experts warned of the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9.
Research shows that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people without folic acid deficiency are less likely to suffer from certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
However, excessive doses on the other hand contribute to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at Alabama University in Birmingham, dietologist Beth Kitchin, advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if it is significantly diverged from this figure to a greater or lesser extent.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, ensuring that dosages are monitored and that milk and other foods that contain folic acid are avoided.
Previously, a nutrition consultant named Rachel Fine folic acid a substance that slows ageing.
Since it is, among other things, held in avocados, Fein recommended that men, after 50 years of age, eat the fruit more frequently.
In the United Kingdom, about 75,000 people could die because of the omicron-stam by April.
Forecasts by British scientists show that the proliferation of the omicron-stam of the coronavirus in the next five months could cause up to 75,000 deaths in England, unless restrictive measures were tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian, referring to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), which is transmitted by TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the British Cabinet ' s Scientific and Advisory Group on Emergencies, by April 2022 at least 25,000 omicron deaths would be recorded in the country, and some 175,000 patients would be hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infections every day.
“Serious measures to control the coronavirus may be necessary to prevent the overcrowding of the National Health Service if the omicron-stamm is more contagious than the delta option, and the existing vaccines cannot prevent the contamination”, said the mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
The British Health Safety Agency had previously reported that if the rate of omicron-stam distribution continued at the current level, about 1 million cases would be detected by the end of the year.
By mid-December, however, the omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, 1,898 cases of omicron-stam contagion have been detected in Britain, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
On 9 December, however, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Jaweed, indicated that in reality, this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for superhulls has grown by a quarter in the world.
The construction of superhulls this year and the orders for the next year are breaking the world's record despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and to combat climate change.
In the world registry of vessels, the number of yachts ordered was 1,200, a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have a desire and money for a floating fortress for 50 million pounds and above will not decrease, says the Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25 per cent more vessels were ordered than the previous year.
Brokers say it's been 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear contamination on land and prefer to flee the pandemic on their own boat.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If all these people used to go to the office and meet with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them are working remotely and negotiating in the winter.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that the shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that the customers are willing to pay more so that their yacht is ready for at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and super rich people could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation of space travel, life on boats, or flying on their own planes, society is irritating because the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists call on governments to act and suggest introducing new taxes and rules for super-rich people, although they realize that this mobility of money will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, only the number of superhuts ordered is impressive, but their characteristics are also impressive.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length greater than 100 metres.
The Norwegian billionaire Rekke builds a 180-metre-long REV Ocean yacht.
Once it's on the water, it's gonna be the biggest yacht in the world.
There is a “summer basin” on the yacht, as well as a submarine designed to study the depths of the sea.
In the existing super-yahts, it has become commonplace for helicopters, open-air cinemas, and on some of them, such as McGregor's yacht, a platform for unification. Richard Wilk, Professor of Economic Anthropology at Indiana, says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas choices, carbon footprints produced by super-rich ones are not significant.
But it's symbolic, given that the multi-billionaires in the world are just over 2,000 people.
It's just another example of the overuse of a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emissions trace of billionaires is thousands of times as high as that of the world’s average resident.
While one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the largest polluter on the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
However, two thirds of the emission trail cooled down on his yacht, Eclipse, which was 162.5 metres long.
Even if the owner is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give him a command to bring the boat from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean, for example.
Superhull owners are not sympathetic to other people when they, like the richest woman in Australia, Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that there is no room for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call for the construction of marinas for vessels in excess of 50 metres.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified leading to intestinal cancer
American scientists have identified the amount of alcoholic beverages a week that increases the risk of cancer.
It's written by the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that the use of four or more drinks per week poses an increased risk of oncology.
However, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of intestinal cancer than women.
The exact cause of this kind of oncology cannot be determined by scientists, noting only that certain factors lead to a process that is harmful to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or more specifically, all dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very smart.
But even they have no idea how developed the four-legged pets are.
For many years, biologists have experimented with different experiments to be sure of how the intelligence of animals is developed.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as human, a new study proves that a dog can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in Sciencealtert.
Dogs can't play chess or compose poems, understand nothing about politics, economy, and art, but they often fool their masters.
Some species, according to experts, show better results in understanding human language, but statistics are not yet sufficient for accurate conclusions.
For example, some species are traditionally considered dog geniuses, such as labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and the ability to learn is not inferior to a two - year - old child.

In Ukraine, they're ready to trade in the United States and Russia.
The United States and Russia will “trade” about Ukraine's entry into NATO, as stated by Analyst Alexander Kochetkov in his article for Glanaud.
In his view, Washington and Moscow were about to continue negotiations on United States assurances that Ukraine would not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden on the right of countries to “accede anywhere”.
If you're offered something known to be unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you're not gonna trade, you're just gonna send the offeror.
And there's a trade going on with Ukraine," wrote an analyst.
Cochetkov added that Russia did not plan to attack Ukraine, but was seeking dialogue with Kiev.
“Preparation is carried out in secret, quickly and immediately to offensive action, rather than waiting for the group to be found and deployed,” he noted.
China stimulates the development of the rail transport industry
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Exhibition, held in Zhuzhou Province of Hunan/Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, noted the representative of How Zhaoven.
High-speed trains on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into service earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will make the rolling stock more reliable and operational.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased rail exports and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing “China's speed”.
In May this year, the first two-storey power trains developed in China, designed for export to Europe, were from the CRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. production line.
At a maximum speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will travel on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
A pilot subway train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began operation in November.
The train will run along the subway line connecting the centre of Istanbul to the airport of the city.
The subway line will be opened next year.
It's going to be the fastest subway line in Turkey at 120 kilometers an hour.
“The Chinese Rail Equipment Industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the highest international innovation competitiveness”, said Feng Yaoxian, head of the China International Trade Facilitation Committee/CEBT/.
"This industry represents the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment on the world market," said Feng Yaoxian.
After more than 60 years of hard work, after a series of independent research and development, China has established an advanced system for the production of railway equipment, with a full range of supporting tools and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosyan, the country is ranked first in the level of electrification of railways and in the running of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist listed early signs of dementia.
A candidate of life sciences, Semen Goloshakin, in a conversation with Radio Sputnik, listed early signs of dementia.
He said that the signs of future dementia could be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive irregularities, such as inability to concentrate, planning and a decline in abstract thinking.
There is now a debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor, says the specialist.
Holoshakin stressed that the causes of dementia may be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and atherosclerosis in the brain are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date doctors do not know how to treat dementia effectively.
Prevention must therefore begin on time.
He said that learning foreign languages and active communication would help to reduce the risk of dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical stress, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive memory involvement and thinking logic
“There are recommendations for the application of the various BADs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still being discussed in the scientific community”, said Holoshakin.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical stress, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive memory and thinking”, said Holoshakin.
Previously, a British dementia charity stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
The early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease were reported by the doctors.
The first warning sign is visual problems that make it difficult for a patient to recognize objects.
Another sign of developing dementia has been called aphasia, a condition where a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent for treatment abroad.
The former President of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili, is in need of psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, and has told journalists the neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the medical consimilation set up under the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading cause of his illness.
The problems of movement, coordination, variability of character are persistent problems”, said the specialist, noting that this is not outside the normative framework and that the ex-president now needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychonergy rehabilitation, which we did not find possible in Georgia," said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began to sabotage medical treatment after he was disciplined by prison officials.
The Georgian policy quickly succeeded in lifting the penalty and restoring its former rights.

Spain protested against COVID passports
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, there were protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate, which is transmitted by Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID passports became mandatory for bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment.
Many of the demonstrators came to the party without masks.
They blamed the State for totalitarianism with slogans on their posters and called for respect for citizens ' choices.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city announced a medical dictatorship, and vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected since the beginning of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
The Russian Federation is also planning to impose restrictions on non-vaccines.
The Government introduced bills on a single QR code system into the State Duma on 12 November.
Russians are expected to be able to visit mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail facilities, with either a certificate of vaccination or a disease carried out or a medical examination of vaccinations.
The same rules will be established for travel on trains and aircraft.

Cool rise: how Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people and help create international resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow President Xi Jinping to gather one trillion yuan, but will also contribute to the economic development of backward, remote provinces.
The Taiwu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among the Chinese.
In addition to building infrastructure in the region, greening is also being carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international competitions.
In many parts of China, where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are snow problems.
The main long-term challenge is to provide comfortable and interesting vacations in Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, it is far from there.
The game adviser Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed to unrecognized.
Every winter, more Chinese go to the hills.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will take many years to create a ski culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to actively develop and develop the infrastructure needed for recreation.
The 70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunley, near the winter Olympics.
He noted that in recent years there had been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, from Beijing to Chungley, they ran a high-speed railway, and now no resident is unemployed.
A growing number of shops are opening up in the country, selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes, the food points of the national kitchen are opened.
There's even a COVID-19 testing station on Taiva now.
China seeks to create a prosperous winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders of major international competitions, and resorts and equipment must reach world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, reported at WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be plunged into extreme poverty because of the Coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed mankind's progress in universal access to health care, has been declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
Two complementary reports were published by WHO and WB on the occasion of the International Day for Universal Health Coverage on 12 December.
They noted that the pandemic had led to disruptions in the provision of medical services and had caused excessive stress in health systems.
In this regard, immunization coverage has declined for the first time in 10 years and tuberculosis and malaria mortality has increased.
WHO and WB emphasized that the pandemic has caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it more difficult for people to pay for treatment”.
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "to extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their pockets."
In October, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres stated that the Coronavirus pandemic had plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and that more than four billion people had little or no social support.

Reuters: Taiwan's Minister was cut off on Sammite for Democracy at the request of the White House.
The presentation by Taiwan's digital minister Audrey Tan at the panel discussion during the US-organized "Sammit for Democracy" was turned into a video-free mode, attesting to the recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, with reference to sources, claims that the picture was disabled at the request of the White House.
They reported that the reason was a map on which Taiwan was distinguished by a separate colour from the PRC, which considered the island to be its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world according to the degree of civil rights.
Taiwan was identified green as “free”, while the PRC, the DPRK, Laos and Viet Nam were identified as red as “closed”.
After the Minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the views of the discussants “do not necessarily express the position of the US Government”.
The PRC was not invited to the "Sammit for Democracy".
Reuters notes that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister may have run counter to the “one China” policy of Washington.
One source of the agency stated that, following a map demonstration, the U.S. National Security Council had angryly contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan a separate country.
Washington's “Sammit for Democracy” took place from 9 to 10 December with the participation of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” summit, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, editor-in-chief of the New Newspaper, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be spent on charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Federation, Yuri Averyanov, stated that the summit was an “anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge”.

On Saturday, 11 December, New Shepherd, with six tourists on board, made a suborbital flight.
The travel on the company’s website lasted more than ten minutes, after which the passenger capsule came down to Earth, reports TASS.

The ship climbed to a height of just over 100 kilometres, and space tourists found themselves in a state of weightlessness.
The launch vehicle itself landed on the launch site.
Blue Orange successfully carried out the first suborbital flight of the New Shepherd ship with passengers on board on 20 July.

China strengthens the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities with land access points
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the PRC issued a circular to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in the cities where land crossings are located, with a view to further preventing the import of infections from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving these cities must provide a negative result of the COVID-19 nucleic acid test obtained within 48 hours of departure.
Those who come to the cities where land passes are located must take at least one test for COVID-19 nucleic acids upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day when the respective provincial administrative units identify and publish the areas of the cities, until 15 March 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with land access points that meet certain conditions may consider establishing buffer zones to prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The orthopedic orthopedic mattress is one of the most affordable models in the ruler.
The practical filler of the Foam balance gives the mattress all the necessary orthopaedic properties, but leaves the price at the budget level.
This product is the best combination of price and quality.
Balance foam is a modern material that comes from the PSP.
The filler is hypoallergenic and safe.
That's why foam is widely used in industry.
Its safety and reliability have been confirmed by a special certificate received in Europe, where such requirements are much more stringent than those of Russia.
Another important quality of the Balance Foam is its orthopaedic nature: the material maintains the right position of the person throughout the sleep.
Because of the foam, the mattress acquired a hardness below the average level, so the product is considered to be a sufficiently soft producer.
The main carrier unit in the mattress is SuperSprings.
It's remarkable for the contents of independent springs, and it has 256 elements per square metre.
The practical unit holds up to 100 kg per sleeping space, distributes the load and adapts the surface to the sleeping surface, increasing the orthopaedic quality of the foam.
The manufacturer provides a choice between a spring block 12 cm high and 18 cm high without changing the final value.
Make sure you give your preferences when ordering the store operator.
The mattress is supplied in a tricottic case, with a model height of 21 cm.
It's an inconvenient case.
The orthopaedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certificate.

In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they described the “truthful conclusion” between Russia and the United States.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Ryabkov, in an interview with the Newsroom, assessed the prospects for Moscow's and Washington's relationship.
He noted that the long road of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
There's one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospect of better relationships, it's completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long journey that we have made with both the current administration and Trump and Obama.
The problem didn't start yesterday," said the diplomat.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US’s desire to impose on Russia approaches on many issues.
The heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that they would not risk providing optimistic projections of the prospects for better relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress had been made.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will heed the arguments of common sense.
Previously, the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, at a meeting with American Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, stated that Moscow was ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
The virologist warned of the risk of vaccination with a nasal drug from COVID outside hospitals.
The COVID-19 drug addicts may be allergic and need medical help, so the first points to inoculate this drug should not be arranged at airports and shopping centres.
This was reported by TASS by a virologist, a RAN correspondent member, at the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology at Novosibirs State University, Sergey Netes.
It's easier to set up vaccination sites at airports and shopping centres, but I'd only do that in the first place in health facilities.
The fact is that allergic reactions to such a vaccine are likely to occur, but it is desirable that the person then sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-alergic drugs that work in just a minute or two, which are sometimes very needed,” says Netesov.
According to the virologist, it would be possible to consider vaccinations at shopping centres once experience in the use of the drug had been gained.
He also stressed that it was important for a nasal vaccine to reach the mucous casing in the bow cavity.
It is likely, however, that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the infested nose is shrivelled after injection.

Serbia produced 2 million doses of Sputnik V vaccine
Sputnik V is the most popular vaccine in Serbia.
Serbia produced about 2 million doses of Russian Sputnik V vaccine, told TASS by the Minister for Innovation and Technological Development of the country, Nenad Popović.
“The Torlak State Institute still produces about 2 million doses of Sputnik V vaccine, and expects that at least 4 million will be produced in the coming period,” Popović said.
According to him, the Russian vaccine is the most popular among Serbs.
The Republic is therefore planning to purchase more than one million doses of vaccine from Russia.
The Minister for Innovation and Technological Development of Serbia also expressed interest in the production in the State of satellite V and Sputnik Light.
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Michustin reported that the Russian Federation had supplied Serbia with almost two million doses of domestic vaccine against the coronavirus infection Sputnik V.

In the United Kingdom, 1,239 cases of omicron-stam coronavirus-RT were recorded 24 hours in Russian
In the United Kingdom, 1,239 cases of new omicron-stam coronavirus infection were detected within 24 hours.
Sky News informs about this.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the "omicron" strain were detected in England, 38 people were infected with a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had estimated in a pessimistic forecast that 75,000 people could die in England by April due to the outbreak of coronavirus caused by the omicron strain.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries imposing anti-Russian sanctions.
The Spokesman for President Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued “aggressive action” against Ukraine, including because of the alleged “instigation” into the country's territory.
“It is impossible to impose any restrictions on Russia and not to suffer for itself,” said the official representative of the Kremlin on the television channel Russia 1.
Sandkov claims it's "all the world understands."
It was previously reported that the US was considering the introduction of anti-Russian energy sanctions as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to impose restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian direct investment fund.
However, the head of the Sberbank, Herman Griff, is convinced that that is not possible.

New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to withdraw from France.
The French channel BFM.TV reported this on 12 December.
96.5 per cent of those who voted opposed independence.
3.51 per cent of the inhabitants of the South Pacific Archipelago supported independence from France.
2.99% of the ballot papers were cancelled.
The voting rate was very low on that day, with about 55 per cent of the inhabitants of the archipelago coming to the plots.
According to experts, the low attendance was due to calls by separatists to withdraw from the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
Most residents supported the location of the archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia to be its domain.
Some 270,000 people live on the archipelago and the Territory has a special administrative-territorial status.
The 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration allowed the region to organize a two-year vote on its independence.

WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily considers that the “omicron” is less dangerous than the delta-stam of the coronavirus.
However, there is evidence of a decline in the effectiveness of vaccines with the new version of COVID-19.
According to information on 9 December, there were 63 countries registered with the “omicron”.
“Preliminary data and a significantly modified antigen protein profile of the "omicron" strain suggest a reduction in the effectiveness of the anti-infection vaccine and the transmission of the variant.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it may be less severe (the burden of the disease - Red.) than in the case of a “detta”, says a WHO technical report.
The organization notes that so far all reported cases of “omicrone” infection in the EU are easy or unsymptomic.
However, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than the Delta.
There were two cases of omicron-stamp infection in Russia.
They were "previously immunized," reported by the Gamaley Center.
The head of Rosclesnadzor, Anna Popova, claimed that there was no reliable evidence to date that the new version of the coronavirus was less dangerous than the rest.

In Ukraine, four scenarios were named for the
Ex-Deputy of the Verkhovna Rada, Vadim Denisenko, listed four scenarios for the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, in 2022.
In his view, the Head of State could be left without Western support and might also compromise on Donbas.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko spoke about it in a publication on the Gloss portal.
The first option, which Denissenko called “the perfect storm”, suggests that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries by reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
This development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"There is a parallel decline in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export "> internal protests and opposition to key FPGs (financial and industrial groups). ", added an ex-parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of “war against everyone”.
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of challenges.
Because of this state of affairs, the Ukrainian leadership can make compromises on Donbass, which may lead to domestic confrontation.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will be weakened, and the probability of such a situation, according to the former Nardep, is up to 50-55 per cent.
The third option in Ukrainian politics is to confront the dissenting groups of the Green and the President, which makes it possible to take control of the force bloc and carry out “populist initiatives”.
In the course of such a crisis, Zelensky will begin “reform of power”, adding Denisenko.
Another scenario is to turn Zelensky into a "father of the nation."
This may result from an event that will be a great shock to society.
“The event must be large enough to trigger reactions from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine”, Denissenko said.
The ex-deputant considers that such an option is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made catastrophe or Russian aggression.
On the other hand, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an “attack” on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the United States that are increasing military activity along Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, a survey of the Sociological Group Reiting showed that the ranking of the Ukrainian President had fallen to a record low of 19.3 per cent.
This is the lowest number since his election as Head of State.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the case of the imminent election of the President of Ukraine for Zelenski, only 21.8 per cent of the votes would have been cast, whereas for the ex-President of the country, Petr Poroshenko, 14.5 per cent.
Of all those interviewed, only 19.3 per cent expressed support for the President.

I'm buying watermelons that weigh four to five kilograms straight from bahchi and not until early August.

Arrested for an action in Red Square by a poet: "A quote of Yevtushhenko is given 10 days, here is the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student of the USE was arrested in Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag #poetwrossius was written by a more poet.
This quote belongs to the writer Evgeny Eutoshenko.
A protocol on the administrative article on the repeated violation of public action was drawn up on Alexander.
He was first arrested on 23 January in Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, and now, unfortunately, has lost interest in it, the decline of the culture common in Russia, and also a little hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," Alexander explains.
We contacted a young poet to investigate the circumstances of his detention and to disclose his message in more detail.
How have you been treated by the police this time and before?
What were they asking the department how they commented on your action?
This time, the staff were more accurate, detention was as polite as it may sound in some context of the word.
At Pushkin, they took the OMONs and took them hard.
Asked standard about motive.
When we heard, in principle, we saw it if it wasn't good, it was understandable.
With the exception of the four sides of the monkey, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was going to do.
And if they start writing their poems under this hashtag after the stock, at least a few people, I'm gonna sit for 10 days.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak in private in the Tumba-yumba language.
And at public and official events, they speak the language of others so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in the mother tongue through an interpreter.
It's protocol and nothing else, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian very well and nevertheless uses the assistance of an interpreter.
Also at official events, an old-fashioned transcript is performed by a pen, and a stenographer is not required to know several languages.

Researchers explained how potatoes help to cope with age disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that contribute to improved circulation and reduced cholesterol levels.
The roots contain vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, ribophlavin, folic acid, and pantotenic acid.
All these elements help the system of the organism to function.
In addition, potatoes help to combat age disorders.
Because of the high cell content, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use it can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the most advantage, root is better to be extinguished or cooked than to be roasted on oil.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, like other products with a high glacial value.
These are products with carbohydrates that quickly split into sugar, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Summersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian dining potatoes, noting the decline in production in personal farms and the increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, only imports could be replaced by product deficits for the time being.
Lostfilm, longfilm and other pirates will be removed from the Yandex issue.
Candidates for departure
In 2015, the rights holders of the RAAC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate web sites and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazarian, CEO of the Institute for Internet Research.
But some -- Kinogo, Lostfield, Filmix -- did survive, including a regular change of domain name, he added.
For example, in the Lostfield, which is available in search of both the Yandex and Google, you can see pirate copies of Netflix's "Squid Game" and "The Tenderness" by the director Anna Melician, the original series of Russia's largest video service, ivi (entered by AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engines, you can look at Encanto's animation novel, but based on the quality of the video, it's a so-called screen (a pirate copy of the film taken in the cinema).

"This Polish-made idea" - it would have been better to say that Poland had just reworked the 1776 idea, but developed it quite efficiently.
In fact, the slogan “Ordinance is not Russia” appeared in 1848.

The lamp is a walled Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
The wide circumference surrounding the "molecules" of light provides as uniform and bright a light as possible.
“Atomic” or “molekular” design, reflecting the nature and nature of each subject, does not lose relevance and allows for the beneficial placement of accents in the interior.
One characteristic of such lamps is the weightlessness of the structure.
The thin, almost invisible cables, which are adjusted in heights, make it feel like the chandelier is floating in the air.
The metallic gold fittings and the matt-and-white miniature platoons will easily add to any palette, and the suspension chandelier and bras present in the collection will be the ready ensemble for the living room, the bedroom, and the hallway.
Well, it tastes like the color it's called.

The Dimax Micro Ultimate Matras, size 160x190
The orthopedic spring mattress of Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient in that it has two softly different surfaces – high hardness and a little bit more than average.
The product includes only quality and bonus fillings, which have proved to be exclusively the best.
Springs: An independent micropackage spring block is installed at the centre of the model.
This means that the sleeping place has 2,000 spirals that work completely autonomously.
It's their operation that gives you a unique point-by-point adjustment.
Micropackage is the highest-frequency diversity of the Dimax spring blocks, so it has a strong orthopaedic effect and is considered to be a bonus.
Fillers: A combination of carpet layers and natural latex is installed from the top and bottom of the springs.
The only difference is the order of the stoves.
If one surface has latex, the other has coconut coke.
This filler tandem has long been classic because it transmits not only orthopedic but also anatomical properties to the mattress.
If the coira provides the right back support, the latex will adapt the surface to the human body.
Chehol: The model is supplied in the protruding tricottal of Aloe Vera.
At the customer's request, it can be made both filmed and fixed.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping space is 170 kg.
Safeguards and security: the guarantee period is three years.
The mattress received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopaedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will seek life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, and reported on Sunday to the Actual Chamber.
The purpose of the five-year start-up missions is to assess the suitability of the Venus clouds and then to search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed tools for measuring acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
So far, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the nearest planet to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist, but it is likely that Venus was originally a planet of the Earth type.
A sample from Venus should arrive during the third mission.
Let's say that if we find life there, the main question is whether it's Earth-like or different.
If so, it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on earth.
If it is different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth,” said the head of the Estonian team of the project "Venus Life Finder" Michael Pajusalu.

Metal universes will change Russian business
The theme of metavolents became popular in the fall of this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become Meta.
For the market, this was an important signal: the major player confirmed the development of a new format for digital interaction between people.
So, business in Russia, as in the world, will invest in creating its own metavolents and then monetizing them.
Metal universes should be seen as a continuation of objective trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards creating remote interactions in a pandemic is that people are tired of divisiveness and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of business's desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.
With the third, they are a logical continuation of the trend towards the digitalization of assets, where any rights, securities, works of art, and even money are digitized.
Anya, you're right, changing the diet is an informed process.
When you start eating the right food, you don't want anything too fat or too bad.

The British economist was unable to predict 2022.
The British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict 2022 because he believed that such attempts would fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert is of the opinion that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend may change turnover.
The most important factor is the Coronavirus pandemic, and the second is inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the price increases for goods were temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, it was clear before the pandemic that “the world of the unending generosity of central banks has already outlived itself” and it is time to return to a relationship where inflation-related interest rates will correlate with the expected GDP growth rate.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of super-soft economic policies could, in the opinion of some experts, lead to a new inflation surge.
Attention should also be drawn to the issue of productivity growth, as well as to the rise in poverty and climate change, as summarized by O'Neill.
Previously, Mikhail Schulgin, Head of Global Research, Open Investment, reported that positive expectations for the dollar for 2022 remained, with less growth potential.
Among the risks to the dollar’s value was the Fed’s monetary policy, oil price dynamics and fears against the background of the Coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one good thing is that when you compare yourself to yourself, there were fewer containers five years ago.
It's better now.

Russians gave about 4.5 per cent of the country ' s GDP to autodealers
After 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion roubles to buy new cars, an increase of 28 per cent over the same period last year, as shown by statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the State to support citizens and the economy during the Coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of country of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that that amount was comparable to more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean brand, Kia, is the leading market in Russia.
In the 10 months of this year, he managed to sell 325.7 billion roubles, an increase of almost 24 per cent over the year before.
The Hyundai family has an even larger growth rate of over 35%, and the profit from the car sales is estimated at 279.3 billion roubles.
In leading positions, this brand and the increase in the weighted average price of the car - it grew by almost 21% in Hyundai over the year, to 1.94 million roubles - the most dynamic of travel was for Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
However, sales of Korean brands have increased less significantly: according to the statistics of the Auto Manufacturers Committee of the European Business Association in Russia, Kya has made 9.4% more cars in the same period than the year before.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota, which has spent 275.5 billion roubles on this mark ' s cars in 10 months, is 14% higher than the year before.
The Japanese follow Mercedes-Benz with 266.1 billion roubles (+75 per cent) - the German bonus market has also increased sales (37 per cent) and the weighted average car price (almost 28 per cent up to 8.2 million roubles).
"Mercedes-Benz simultaneously has a good growth in sales and a weighted average price -- more than BMW -- from here on, and a larger increase in financial capacity," explained NAPI CEO Tatiana Arabaji.
At the rate of growth in sales, fantastic performance is shown by Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased the financial capacity this year.”
Russian Lada shows an average market value (plus 28%), and Russians spent 229.4 billion roubles on their cars in 10 months.
At last year's financial capacity, there are companies whose car sales fell in 2021: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
The UAZ, in the minus, spent 12 billion roubles on SUVs and pickups in 10 months, compared to 12.4 billion roubles a year earlier.
Against the background of supply problems and production disruptions affecting the world's roadway, road companies continue to continuously adjust prices, the same AutoVaz increased the cost of the Lada models seven times a year, the last journey (by 8 to 10,000 roubles) occurred at the end of November.
Prices are regularly rewrote for their products and other automakers.
Russia’s car market will continue to increase in monetary terms, in addition to the shortage of cars, by means of inflation, as well as the drive of car concerts to recover from past losses, experts believe.
Given the shortage of cars, I think that many car concerts have even been able to partially transfer to the consumer the costs of past periods that they could not place at the price of cars before,
This is an analyst from the BTB Capital on Vladimir Bespalov's motorway.
I believe that in financial terms, automakers are feeling very well right now, maintaining a high margin of sale.”
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, and the price of new cars increases faster than inflation, the expert explains.
In the long run, the market will grow in both quantitative and monetary terms, but mainly through inflation and the complexity of machine design itself, predicts Bespails.
As supply increases, opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, Russian authors will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the cost of cars slows down, auto manufacturers will be able to earn their income from the volume, notes the independent consultant for the Car Prom Sergey Burgasliev.
In view of the increased demand and undersupply, car manufacturers are now seeking the greatest profit from every car sold, notes Burgasliyev.
No increase in car production is expected in the next six months, and in Russia, the agitation is also fuelled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the market situation, cars have proved to be a good investment - a car purchased a year ago, even with a mileage, can now be sold more than the original cost, the expert notes.
Biden commented on a US military transfer to Ukraine in the event of Russia's invasion.
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending US troops to Ukraine in the case of Russia's “pronunciation.”
President Joe Biden of the United States made this statement.
“There have never been such plans”, said the White House head, responding to a journalist’s question as to whether the US has abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalated, Russia would face economic consequences.
He stressed, however, that the United States and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine was not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States would move forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia).
“We will have to direct more American and Natyan troops to the east flank, B9 – all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia”, Biden said.
Earlier, President Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary of Russia, stressed that Moscow had no intention of entering Ukraine.
In doing so, he pointed out that Moscow saw a problem in the military use by Kyiv of Turkish drones and that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.

If a fraudster calls from such a number, such as a "Ministry of Internal Affairs officer" or other power structure, it's inefficient to drop it immediately and probably not to blacklist it.
