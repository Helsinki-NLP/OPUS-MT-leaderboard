Semilarski v. the Public Prosecutor ' s Office: the former Vice-President Tartu ' s Cassation will be reviewed on 4 August
This means that it is likely to be decided in early September.
The courts of the first two courts refused to hear the Semilarski case, but in April his appeal was admitted to the State Court of Justice.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant, as the author ' s permission was not within his jurisdiction.
The court ' s decision stated that the complaint contained a claim for damages in criminal proceedings.
“The Public Prosecutor's Office and the County Court are responsible for such matters”, previously explained to ERR's Correspondent for the Tartu Courts, Anette Kreitsmann.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed the order to the District Court, which, on 5 February, did not alter the decision of the court of first instance.
Now it's up to the State Court to say his word.
According to Semilarski, the juror, Oliver Neyes, his client was unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
He now asks the Public Prosecutor ' s Office to rebut the wrong allegations against him and to reimburse him for moral damages.
The reason for the application to the court was the statements made by the Special Prosecutor of the Liuna District Prosecutor ' s Office, Margus Gross, in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with the other then Vice-Mart Artem Suvorov, was arrested on suspicion of having committed a number of crimes.
“Remember, when I was arrested, the Security Police and the Public Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that Tartu's leaders, one of the most powerful local government authorities, are corrupt.
These public suspicions in the air have been accompanying me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have been false, the Public Prosecutor's Office has no intention of saying anything about it,” commented Semilarski in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyes, at a press conference, the Public Prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the Public Prosecutor ' s Office was to operate.
"The claim of bribes and corruption has been false, but it's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia as well as on Lithuania, that during the investigation phase, State representatives should be careful when choosing the words so that the suspects would not be represented as criminals before the sentence was handed down.
The Public Prosecutor's Office also imposes a presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, has not been respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” Neyes said.
“The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and a bribe in circumstances where the facts on which the suspicion of bribery is based are still found to be unacceptable, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the complainant”, added counsel.
As rus.err.ee wrote, former vice-president Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be held to account for the charges of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, a former official is tried on the charge of knowingly violating anti-corruption law in very large transactions.
According to the Indictment, from 2015 to 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated more than 30 times in the City Hall ' s meetings in making decisions related to the Tartu companies, whose owners or leaders, Semilarski, was active at the private level during the off-the-job period.
According to Gross, in all of these cases, Semilarski had a personal interest, and he should have been disassociated from the decision-making process.
Previously, as rus.err.ee wrote, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has accused the Semilarski of taking bribes and violating anti-corruption laws in dealing in very large sizes.
This was the case in October 2016, when he was arrested with the other deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centre Party).
At that time, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against the two vice-presidents.
Since then, both officials have resigned.
The Suvorov case later reached the court, which fully justified the policy.
The trial of Valvo Semilarski is still under way.

How the economy will be affected by the decision of the CB to lower the key rate
The Bank of Russia is expected to lower the key rate again.
It went down another 0.25 percentage point, up to 4.25 per cent of the annual, the formal next historical minimum.
Judging from the return of the short step of the downswing, as well as the tone of CB statements and the up-to-date forecasts of the Russian economy, the regulator is more optimistic about the economic prospects than ever before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy relaxation can soon stop.
“We continued to soften the monetary policy, first of all, given that the risk of inflation falling down from 4% in 2021,” reported the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvir Nabiullin.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabiulina, will take more than a year and a half.
She noted, however, that following the lifting of the restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes had been revitalized: energy use, consumer and investment demand had been restored, the construction and production of consumer goods had been expanded, and the annual rate of decline in transport and production had slowed.
According to the updated BC, in 2020 the economy will be down to 4.5 to 5.5% (previously 4-6%) and the economic recovery in 2021 will be 3.5 to 4.5%, and in 2022 it will be down to 2.5 to 3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the prognosis for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
The C.C. had previously expected US$ 27 and US$ 35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia’s inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7 to 4.2 per cent, as compared with the previous expected 3.8 to 4.8 per cent.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, bringing us closer to the end of the relaxation cycle, and the economists in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States think of the Renaissance Capital, Sofia Donets and Andrey Melashchenko.
For example, the Bank of Russia has consistently lowered the key rate for over a year, and since the beginning of last summer it has fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the CB reduced it by one percentage point, due to low inflation due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate a stagnant economy due to the pandemic and its associated constraints.
The chances of a monetary policy fixing (at the next meeting on September 18 and the end of the year) remain, but the limit is at hand, and the Chief Analyst, Rosbanka Evgeniy Koschelev, agrees.
The stock of inflationary risk also indicates the nearness of a pause in the mitigation of interest policies - broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to the prevention of the epidemic, and a faster (than expected) recovery of demand, he said.
As a follow-up, the Bank of Russia will need more attention to inflation during the harvest season, as well as to the external volatilism, which has increased in the context of geo-political conflicts, Koshelev points out.
In one way or another, lowering the key rate will result in further lowering the rate for the most secure borrowers, as well as possibly on the mortgage, says Maxime Petrenevich, a senior think tanker at the Open Bank.
The rate adjustment would be less pronounced than a reduction in the key rate, he clarified.
Beneficiary rates can fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage point in the second half of the year, mortgage rates can end up between 6 and 7 per cent, and the BCS prime economist Anton Poctovic does not rule out.
The average deposit rate, in his view, would also fall - in the coming months, it could fall to 4.2 to 4.5% (now just over 4.5%).
Then they can go down to 4% if the CB lowers the key rate in the fall, Poctowitch thinks.
The Centralist Party pledges to pay all its debts by the end of the year.

"At today's financial projections, the Centralist Party will be computing its current debts and obligations by the end of this year," Corb said.
It has been reported earlier that the party of the Prime Minister has returned to the State 110,100 Euros, which have been declared a prohibited donation.

Survey: The ruling Union of Landlords and Greens of Lithuania has once again led the Party Rating
The Union of Landlords and Green Lithuania, which is the head of the Seimas ruling coalition, has led the ranking of the parties.
This was shown by a poll carried out by Vilmorus Sociological Research Company on the order of Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the parliamentary elections in 2016, the “crusaders” lost their first place and long led Russia's main critic in Lithuania, the opposition “Union of the Nation - Christian Democrats (Conservatives).
However, recently, the President of Lithuania, Gitanas Nauseda, in his assessment of the electoral capabilities of the parties, stated that the Union of Farmers and Greens, after this year's parliamentary elections, was likely to be able to form the coalition again.
This statement has led to the resentment of the conservatives.
The last poll showed that if the parliamentary elections had been held today, 17.6 per cent of the voters and 17.2 per cent of the conservatives would have voted for the peasants.
According to Director Vilmorus Vladas Haydes, the break-up was within the margin of error, and yet the rulers were no longer behind the conservatives.
According to Haydes, the sociological success of the “crusaders” was prompted by the news that Prime Minister Saulius Svernimis would be the head of their electoral list.
This politician was the first on the list of "crusaders" and in the 2016 elections.
The third is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 per cent of the respondents are now ready to vote.
She suddenly lost 2%.
The fourth is the Labour Party, headed by a businessman of Russian origin, Victor Uspaski (6.2%).
The rest of the political organizations, according to the poll, will not be able to break the 5 per cent electoral barrier.

Excess requirements for requests for public procurement are excluded by law
The law may set out exhaustive requirements for bids for procurement.
In the fall session of the plenary, the State Duma is planning to take up, on second reading, a bill setting out the requirements for the content and formulation of an application for procurement, to which only small- and medium-sized business entities can participate.
The Government is amending the Act on the Procurement of Goods, Works, Services of Certain Legal Entities.
The bill was drawn up pursuant to the Road Map for the Implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium-sized Entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation up to 2030, which was approved by the Government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that the bidders are entitled to request from the bidders - small and medium-sized business entities.

To date, the Act on the Procurement of Goods, Works, Services of Certain Types of Legal Person governs the procurement of certain types of legal persons.
The requirements for the content, form, presentation and formulation of the request for participation in the procurement shall be determined by the bidders themselves in the procurement documentation.
“As a result, the contracting authority imposes superfluous requirements for the content, presentation of the application, the mandatory presence of certificates, certificates, statements, the period of receipt of which is comparable to the time of application by the authorized authorities, which results in the inability to participate in such purchases and a reduction in the number of participants in the procurement”, the bill is explained.

“Acceptance of the instrument will make it possible to exclude the arbitrary requirement of the contracting parties to the formulation and content of the bids of small- and medium-sized business” is set out in the Explanatory Note.

Dr. Butcher named the main human health indicators.
In the “lethal quartet”, one of the main criteria was the excess of the waist.
Alexander Butcher, a doctor and TV host, spoke about key indicators for human health.
His so-called “death quartet” included four criteria - an increase in pressure, cholesterol, sugar, and waist volume - a doctor on TV station Russia 1.

For men, this should not exceed 102 centimetres; for women, it should be 88 centimetres.
Exceeding these standards may suggest that health is at risk.
First of all, it's a heart condition - the size of the waist above the norm is a risk of stroke, heart attack, and cancer and diabetes.
Remember, the Butchers used to tell us why we can eat candy for the night.
The doctor explained that sugar was not in itself a health risk, that dessert would be harmful only when it was a lot of food, and that candy for the night, he said, was not the worst snack.

US experts called Pompeo the worst State Secretary in the history of the country
International experts, Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolski, named Mike Pompeo the worst State Secretary in the history of the United States.
On 23 July, CNN published a material with their opinion.
"In just two short years, Mike Pompeo - with a focus on the presidency in 2024 and the support of President Donald Trump - has not only become the worst State Secretary in United States history, but also the most politically biased," the text states.
The experts accused Pompeo of “politicizing the post of Secretary of State and desecrating the institution he runs” in order to advance his personal political agenda and protect Trump “from responsibility and the rule of law”.
According to them, the Secretary of State, inter alia, conceals the “Trampic blackmail of Ukraine” and is prepared to frame the American foreign affairs agency for its cooperation with Congress in the matter.
Pompeo also recalled that he was very kind to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Ben Salman, who assumed a partial responsibility for the murder of the watcher of The Washington Post, Jamal Haskhaji.

The head of the region, Igor Kobzev, met with the mayors of the Ust-Ordinsky Buryat Region
At a workshop held today, 24 July, the Government of the Irkutsk Region discussed the main directions for the development of remote agrarian areas.
During the working visits to the Ust-Ordinsk Buryat district, the head of the region gave a number of assignments.
The mayors have reported on their performance today.
In the first place, the construction of a sports house in Ust Ord was relaunched.
The mission was given by the President of the Russian Federation 14 years ago.
But it's just now that the situation has moved from a dead end.
It will cost 866 million roubles.
Deliverable of the building in 2022.
As of this year, the school in the village of Bayandai should be in operation.
The area has now been replenished.
Out of the rest of the work, it's the land refurbished.
In general, the programme for the construction of pre-primary and secondary education is of particular importance to the region.
For your county in particular.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we have a duty to create all the conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages, lauded the Vrio Governor of the Irkutsk oblast, Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to be actively involved in the development of human settlements gene plans.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.
All localities must have defined boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the Territory, for the construction of socially important facilities, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, as stressed by the head of the region.
Also during the interview, the problem of a 30 per cent reduction in the intake of milk from cooperatives was raised.
This was due to the reallocation by the processing company of the purchase of milk to the benefit of farm-farm farms.
As a result, the share of co-operatives' products has fallen.
The Head of the Region has instructed the Acting Minister of Agriculture to go to the field, to study the structure of the milk market, to analyse the experience of other territories and to identify options to address the problem.

The authorities of Pod-Moscow spoke of the fate of the closed dumps
In Pod-Moscow, solid domestic waste sites continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are being renovated to modern landfills.
But this option is not possible for every site, and many of them have grown to a densely built housing.
Once the range is closed, it gets up on the regeneration - the body of the range is overburdened with dirt, and gas-freeing and infiltration systems are set up.
This puts an end to the chemical processes inside the dump, so that it does not ignite, run out of stench, or poison the soil or the ground water.
And then the former dump stays up in a pointless pile of housing that's been around it.
Why don't we do something useful out of it?
For example, in Rouse, where the Annano field was just completed the other day, the authorities are considering the option of making a ski slope out of a pile.
The site, which was used from 1976 to 2016, has grown to the point where the land has been allocated to it.
Therefore, in the recovery, it was necessary to buy the neighbouring areas, which, in fact, had long been full of trash.
"Sometimes, the ground will sit down, and the fortress will come up, and we'll think what we can do to make it work.
A ski resort is in the eye," told the head of the Russian district, Nikolai Parthenov.
The two sites will be renewable energy sites
The Torbeevo polygons in Lubertsa and Timochovo in the Bogorod district will be sites for the production of renewable energy from landfill and biological gas.
By the end of the year, a gas-pumping power plant will be launched in Torbeyev, which can generate up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal power, which will provide for its own needs, namely, the heating of administrative and industrial facilities.
Timochovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste-recycling complex.
And at the Kuchino Balachino test site, which was closed after the people's complaints on the "Full Line" with the President of the country, a museum can be created.
"The idea was to set up a Museum of Remediation of the Podskowfields," the vice-minister of the government, Dmitri Kurakin, Minister of Ecology and Environmental Management.
Israel reported a drone crash in southern Lebanon

According to Degtyrev, the country of Habarov cannot now be left without a leader, so it was appointed by a decree of President Wladimir Putin to head the region so that “a remarkable building (the government of the province) would function, everything would work, the budget would be spent on social needs”.
Vrio the Governor explained that he had not been to the protesters before, because he was unable to communicate with thousands of protesters.

The beautiful high minarets only decorated Aya-Sophia
Again, about Aya-Sophia, there was a text about Vladimir Zelinsky, which, like, should be protested.
First of all, there's a free entry - cheers!
I haven't been to Istanbul, but the House of God is better free than paid.
Second, the Muslims won this land as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volgo-Oqsa, the Muslim Kaukasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apples on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
We're gonna give it all back to everyone?
You don't think there's any Gentiles who're gonna ask for their house back, where the Tenth Church is?
Third, the Muslim people have improved the building, invested in it.
I mean, it's just like the factories and the land that the Leninians took from the Bourgeois to their property, and it's owned by the Lenin - Putin and other nomenclatures.
They've improved everything from the Kremlin to Angara, so it's all their right-wing progressors.
The beautiful high minarets have very adorned Aya-Sophia, very.
It was a stupid ink, it was a stupid ink with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no “islamic” or “orthodox” civilizations.
There are the believers, and there are the hypocrites, and there are the profanes, who unite the faith and the hypocrisy.
A believer in the categories of civilization don't think.
It's the thinking of a British MIDA Toynbee, a believer who's ashamed to think like this.
And to a believer there is a place of worship.
Always.
The believer does not pray except where he is asked to go. He is taken to another place and prays there.
He's a believer, not a defender.
We're splinters, not murmur rocks.

Rwandese confessed to burning the cathedral in Nantes

I knew Briant's ego couldn't get hit by a crack to not stimulate his sporting anger.
Coby had the killer's instinct, so on the set I tried to talk to him so he wouldn't take the game aggressively.
On the set, I gave him a compliment, "Oh!
Kobe, good shot, good pass!
Listening to my thrilled reactions, he was a bit forgetting to take the ball again and get three or four more points.
We've been in good contact with Koby," quotes Kirilenko's words, "Moscow Night."
He also spoke about his first game against Jordan.
"I cared for him.
The first three minutes of the match, I was running in full admiration for the legend that I saw on TV alone.
While I was so happy to have a breath in my belly, Michael got a lot of points.
Shortly after, I moved out of the groceries, and a couple of times I covered up his shots...
In that game, my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points," he added the head of the Russian Federation.
In the NBA, Kirilenko spent 12 seasons.
He was selected by the Utah Jazz Club on the 1999 draft with a total number 24.
In addition to the Utah, for which he spent ten seasons, the Russian forward was in favor of the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Broochlin Nets.
A total of 797 matches, with an average of 11.8 points, performed 5.5 rebounds, 2.7 apprentices and 1.8 block shots.
It has been previously reported that Kirilenko will submit his candidacy for the election of the head of the Russian Federation.

An actor from the Russian show "Chiki", who was accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism", responded to the film's claims.
The authors “understood the severity of the topics raised and didn't want to offend anyone,” said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in an interview with the issue of The Rise.
"I think it's a story about the power and the common aspects of human life.
This has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said the actor who played the boy's father, who changed into a woman's dress.
He stressed that he was “greeting for work” and did not think it to be propaganda.

But we were open, so the people who first came in with the demands, began to help us,' he summed up.
