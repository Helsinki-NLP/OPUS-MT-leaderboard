The Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
The new Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, is meeting with his Japanese colleague, Sinzo Abe, in Tokyo to discuss economic and security links, as part of his first major foreign visit after the May election.
Mr. Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic links with the world's third largest economy.
Plans to expand nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
India also appears to be looking forward to an agreement on defence cooperation between the two States.
The Russian Federation FANO will hold a final expert session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia), together with RNA, will hold the third Expert Meeting on the Assessment of the Effectiveness of the Activities of the Scientific Organizations.
The meeting will be final in a series of meetings held by the Agency during the year, and a press release will be issued to Lente.Rue.
The third meeting is to take stock of the work of the Expert Session in the year and to draw up a final list of indicators to measure the performance of the scientific organizations.
The participants in the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of the scientific groups and the criteria for the conduct of the assessments.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to develop a unified approach for all three academies to the assessment of the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have been able to do so, and the final version of the legal instruments is in the process of being negotiated.
As a result of the next session, we must complete the process of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the assessment,” said the head of the expert and analytical office of the Russian FANO, Helena Axenova.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than 100 scientific institutions in Russia.
As a result, a resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on 16 September 2014 at the city of Moscow, Solanka Street, House 14.
Scientists have found a way to locate related stars.
Astrophysics from the University of California in Santa Cruz have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star groups.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow for the search among the stars for kinsmen, that is, from one cluster.
The results of their studies have been published in the journal Nature and can be found briefly on the University ' s website.
The reason for the same chemical composition of the nearest stars is the turbulent mixing in the clouds of gas that precedes the formation of the stars.
Even if a born star then leaves the star cluster, the chemical composition of the star can be used to determine the place of her birth and the region of birth.
In the past, scientists doubted that the evolution of a star outside the cluster might result in a difference in the chemical content of a star from that of a relative in the cluster.
Simulation results from astrophysics show that such differences should not emerge.
In their study, experts modelled two interstellar gas streams, which together formed a cloud.
This object, for a few million years under its own gravity, is transforming into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added tags to the initial gas streams and found that rapid turbulent mixing in the Cloud achieved a high degree of chemical homogeneity.
Astrophysics believe that their research proves that it is possible to search for chemically related stars, as well as to identify possible regions of the formation of such objects.
Carrata Police arrested a 20-year-old after following a motorbike at high speed.
The motorbike was confiscated after it was driven at 125 km/h in an area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and across the Bushland to escape the Pilbar Police.
A transport police patrol in Carrat this morning tried to stop a blue motorbike, finding it at a speed of 125 km/h when it left the service station at Batgate Road.
The police report that the motorcyclist did not stop and continued on the Burgess Road, then rolled off to the bushland, which left the police out of sight.
A motorbike and a man in line with the driver's description were spotted next to a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Carrata's police charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and driving dangerously.
He is to be brought before the Carrata Court of Justice on 23 September.
The motorbike was seized and detained for three months.
The school year in the DND will not start before October

Lavrov: Russia will not "knock the door" in connection with the new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not "knock the door" in connection with the new sanctions.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergey Lavrov, spoke to the students and professors of the MGIMO today.
With regard to our response to a new wave of anti-Russia sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything has to be premeditated,' he said.
And when we figure out what European and American partners are gonna do this time, then we're gonna decide how to respond.
This will not involve slaming the door, some sort of resentment, misunderstood,' the Minister stressed.
First of all, we will be moving away from our interests, our interests to protect our economies, the social sphere, our citizens, our business, and we will draw conclusions from the actions of the partners on their adequacy, contractual capacity and credibility.
The steps taken in the area of sanctions can be very well judged by what the partners are doing, as continued by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
If it's said in all their voices, "they're gonna be painful for us, too, but we have to do it to punish Russia," it's probably not very appropriate.
As far as the WTO was concerned, the withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions was not.
On the other hand, we want to learn more about the WTO instruments, including when it comes to trade disputes, Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome, we believe, the EU ' s discriminatory anti-dumping policy.
According to the Minister, Russia has been accused of dumping, while taking anti-Dumping measures against the Russian economy.
“We are ready to use the mechanisms of the WTO and to defend our position on the non-approachability of the EU's third energy pack in a retrospective way,” said Lavrov.
How do you use the grey in the design of the garden?
Irina Okuneva answers the questions:
Since the beard loses its main attraction after blooming, it is desirable to plant it with other shrubs.
It fits well with many cultures.
And you can and should plant plants that are decorative at other times and bloom at the same time as the siren.
And another plus of sirens is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stamp tree of different heights, an improved shrub, a shrub with a wide base, and even a likeness of a garden bonsae, a tree with a bizarrely twisted stem.
Just pick the form that's more in line with the design of your garden.
In Karelia, a man in Leningrad oblast has been convicted for the sale of counterfeit money.
According to the national Ministry of Internal Affairs, a man was engaged in his criminal activities in the Olonetsk and Segegege districts.
In addition to Karelia, he has committed similar crimes in other parts of the country.
In particular, the accused has already been heirs in the Vologoda region, where he was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment in the spring of this year.
Later, the man was brought before the Olonets District Court.
And in order to complete the investigation of the crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Segejo.
In the course of the investigation, a number of episodes of the sale of counterfeit money in the summer of 2013 have been found guilty.
At the end of June this year, the criminal record of the indictment was sent to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the court decided to replace the term of imprisonment with four years in a general-regime colony.
The sentence has not entered into force.
Let me remind you, last week, two more counterfeit money dealers have been convicted of paying off in Petrozavodsk's shops.
The citizens of Azerbaijan also arrived in Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them is incarcerated for five years, the other for four years.
A fine of 500,000 roubles has been imposed on everyone.
The sentence has also not yet entered into force.
In Archangelsk, the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy, "Dervish."
The meeting, which was held at the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
The Durvish delivered military assistance from the US and the United Kingdom to the USSR.
In Archangelsk, a memorial meeting was held at the site of a future monument by members of the North Convoys, which is located on the Cedov River name in Solombal.
The event was attended by representatives of the archangelian Veteran Organizations, children from the cadets class.
For the first time, we met twenty-three years ago, when the mortgage stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a holiday, but a day of memory of those who have not been returned by the sea," noted Boris Karpov, Chairman of the North Sea Veterans' Council.
The event was then played by the city's perfume band, and the cadets of the cadets gave the veterans flowers and marched with Russia's flags and the banner of the Victory.
The meeting ended with the putting of colors on a mortgage stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport, loaded with strategic raw material (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of uniforms, tin, wool, and a host of other items of equipment and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and armament - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, 15 Harrikane fighter jets - were on board in disassembled condition.
At the same time, the escort was 16 British Navy ships, including two carriers.
The Caravan of the vessels was not found by the adversary and reached its destination, Archangelsk.
Out of a total of 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 transport vessels and about 50 military vessels have been killed.

Recalling the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights.
Congressmen Kit Allison and John Lewis have proposed a bill under which the organization of trade unions is protected as a civil law.
"Where the trade unions are, there are middle-class jobs," says Allison, the Minnesota Democrat, who is the co-chair of the Progressive Fracture Congress.
That's why I'm proud to introduce the Workers' Empowerment Act, along with the symbol of the John Lewis Civil Rights Movement.
This innovative bill will give employees the same legal opportunity to discriminate against trade union organizations as against other forms of discrimination by halting the forces of trade union opponents.
The reform of the Labour Relations Act to enable employees who face discrimination for taking part in the organization of trade unions to seek justice in the civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and fines - is a sound and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis, and the sponsors of the bill are talking about is to remember a very American idea.
Despite the attacks on trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states all over the country - Americans once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember, when the country was at the same time defending democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas McArthur and his associates helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Todjo’s war-ridden autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware of the role of workers and their trade unions in the formation of a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to organize, to negotiate and to collective action is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his associates helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler’s fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the need for workers to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that was open to saying: “The right to form associations to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to everyone and to every profession or profession.
Agreements that limit or seek to infringe this right will not have legal effect; measures to that end will be found to be illegal.
When the former First Lady of Eleonor Roosevelt was the Chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights, to be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to defend his or her interests”.
Generations of Americans have accepted as a proper basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to build civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and to have the trade union participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government institutions - should be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago,
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the nation's forces, but has increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised an entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how it should be for us.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the expansion of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - was long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis are reviving ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge is temporarily blocking a law that could shut down all the abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the U.S., a federal judge temporarily blocked the entry into force of the Louisiana Act on Sunday, about which his supporters say he's likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana, Bobby Ginadl, in June, and was to enter into force on 1 September, the doctors who perform the abortions would have been required to have the right to receive patients in the hospital within a 30-mile range from their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision means that, for the time being, doctors can continue to perform legal abortions by continuing to seek such authority.
"The appellants will be allowed to work in a legal manner while continuing to exercise authority," wrote Judge John deGrevells in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled within the month at which the judge will render a more permanent decision under the Act.
Protectors of the right to an abortion were happy to meet this decision, the last in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to get sick leave.
“Today's decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from the insidious law, which seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Northap, the president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who sued for a stay of the law on behalf of three out of five state clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision referred to the doctors in the two clinics who did not file a complaint in the case, and also applied for admission.
Louisiana is part of the 11 states that have enacted such laws, and the courts have recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would have shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to an abortion, together with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the admissions laws impose medically unnecessary restrictions.
Opponents of abortion objected to such measures aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some also noted their positive effect in closing the clinics.
Only one doctor who performs an abortion in Louisiana has the power to receive a hospital, reported to the Center for Reproductive Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state had to stop doing this, the doctor, fearing for his safety, would have stopped doing it, the group reported.
Criticizing the decision, the Louisiana officials said that they would not punish the doctors who performed the abortions while their applications for admission were pending a decision.
The result of the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of product in the range of trade networks should be from Russia; Oleg Nilov, a member of the State Duma of the Fair Russia faction, considers them to be Russian.
The Parliamentarian has drafted a bill to introduce protective measures against domestic producers, writing in the newspaper Isvestia.
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort to the buyers.
This is the case for goods that are not produced in Russia, and for the rest of the products produced in Russia, the Riteiller will have to provide at least half of his shelves to domestic producers,” Nilov reported to the publisher.
Together with the amendments to the article “On the basis of State regulation of trade in the Russian Federation”, the bill provides for an amendment to the Tax Code to set a lower rate of VAT of 10 per cent for the sale of products produced in Russia.
The idea of a 50 per cent quota in trade networks is part of a package of incentives for Russian producers.
There will be more than a few times more domestic goods on the counters.
But the initiative can have both a positive and a negative effect, say experts.
According to the lawyer of the tax company, a member of the independent expert centre of the Public Duma, Sergey Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and will result in growth.
The plus will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They'll be able to sell more, which means they'll get more.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate to the retaliators their terms and prices, as they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will result in higher taxes than ever.
This will increase the revenue of the budget, create new jobs, and some industries will begin to expand, some will become more self-sustainable, and contribute to the growth of GDP.
Russia’s dependence on foreign food will fall several times, not at all,” the expert observes.
In the past, Russian enterprises were often unable to get into local shops because of the high competition of foreign analogues.
Now, after the imposition of the embargo, this niche has been freed up, and we can take a breath of relief.
But let us not forget that after all the necessary reconciliations and sanitary checks, food from Latin America, Turkey, and Serbia will be available to the Russian market.
In other words, now is the moment of quiet, when the former players have left, and the new ones have not yet arrived.
After almost a month, we can talk about an increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as an increase in the price of finished products,” said Aif.ru, the first vice-president of the Russian public organization, the Russian Club of Financial Directors, Tamara Kasyanov.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food in each category would help to secure the sector for local producers.
In such a case, they would compete with each other, not with goods that, through subsidies from another State, were cheaper.
In other words, the fight for the buyer will be waged between companies operating under the same industry law.
On the other hand, Kasyanov notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of compatriots far from all.
And in this situation, trade networks will have to “create” the share of Russian goods up to half of the range.
As a result, there is a growing fear that bad goods will be available on the counters.
Perhaps, under the guise of being produced in Russia, foreign products will be supplied with broken labels,” the expert adds.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will be felt by major trade networks, especially those that are more advantageous to co-operate with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers will also be affected by such a scenario, as the demand for their products will fall.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the Law on Quotas for Domestic Products can also have an impact on consumers.
The fact is, some Russian-made products can give way to the quality of import analogues, while shops can inflate the price of the second as a scarce product.
In the early 2000s, economists again spoke about the idea of import-immigration in February this year, due to the continued devaluation of the ruble.
Now, in the face of a difficult relationship with the West, the issue of non-importing products has become even more relevant.
The Act is intended to require retellers to be considered by domestic producers when ordering suppliers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the way to import, and a system of planning for the production of the required products will be put in place in a shorter time frame,” says MP Oleg Nilov.
A particularly effective quota mechanism will be for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are in a position to cover all the stalls of Russian shops.
In addition, meat production can also have a strong impulse.
As is known, the highest share of imports is found for beef, from 30 to 35 per cent.
So, 65 to 70% of the total is still Russian,” Kasyanov reasoned.
The experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will contribute to and can speed up the process.
But this initiative will not in itself lead to import, as it requires a set of measures, I believe Litvinenko.
In any event, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative can still be imported from abroad, which means that no full import will take place, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
In addition, it is not enough to set quotas, and there is still a need for domestic product production in the country to meet those quotas.
Quota data will provide such guarantees,” the expert notes.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment means that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of the memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia face a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than urban residents.
Researchers analysed the disease maps of over 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian ovarians in 2005 and found that only 35 per cent lived five years after the diagnosis was made.
The leading researcher, Susan Jordan, of the QIMR Berghofer Institute for Medical Research, reported that the probability of dying during the study is 20 per cent higher for those living in the state ' s regions and remote areas than for those living in urban areas.
NEAR STUDY: New drugs can slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers have tracked the women's medical path in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the woman's age at the time of the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases, and socio-economic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of the diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regions or remote states, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that late diagnosis and lack of access to optimum treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecology, and they are mostly in big cities," she said.
Despite the improvement in the quality of telemedicine services in order to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of out-of-area services that would enable professionals to treat women closer to the home and support programmes for people in treatment far from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of geographical location, the study found that the longevity of women with ovarian cancer was rare, emphasizing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Chancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Bank, Elisha Nive, said she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open the door in the Kugenerian region.
The construction of a health-care facility in the village of Toktybelik was started in April of this year and was a model project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million roubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of Chapter Mary Al, the project was financed from the national budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the facility under construction is almost 230 square meters.
It will provide health care to the inhabitants of eight localities: the village of Toktyebelak and the villages of Dementievo, Püncherymal, Tuna, Fomichi, Toribelak, Shinur and Cheskaal.
The new midwifery post will replace the current FAP, whose building was built in 1918 and has long run out of resources, and its premises do not meet hygienic requirements.
The new institution will be opened shortly.
Killing a four-month-old son in a drunken state will be brought to justice.
The woman in Chuvashia will be on the bench for the murder of her own child.
In Ceboxara, the criminal case of a 31-year-old inhabitant of Novogokossarsk, who was accused of causing death by negligence, has been completed.
The investigation found that, on 26 July this year, the accused, together with her four-month-old son, had come to celebrate the birth of her son in Ceboxara.
After a long table, she decided to stay and put her kid to bed.
When the baby woke up at night and wept, a sober woman put it next to her bed to feed her breasts, but soon fell asleep.
During her sleep, a woman fell on her son, and he died of suffocation.
The criminal case, according to the U.S. Press Service of the U.S.C.C. for Chuvashi, has been brought to court.
Inflation's out of vacation.
Will the Russians feel a steep rise in prices?
As a result of the Russian Federation's and West's cross-restraints, inflation in Russia will accelerate and fall short of the government's predictions, and the analysts of BTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed effects of anti-sanctions will result in an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writing to RBC Daily.
According to the most recent forecast of the Mino-Economy, inflation in 2014 will be 6.5 to 7.5 per cent, down from 6.5 per cent in the following year.
However, according to the American newspaper, this week the MEA is expected to make “small but fundamental” adjustments to the macro-economic outlook until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency can lower the rate of inflation for 2015, which will eliminate the expected upturn in the population ' s income.
The forecast was that the Russian Federation ' s food sanctions were in place for a year up to August 2015.
How could such high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation presupposes a one-time shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change," said a newspaper source in Minfin.
The BTB-Capital economists do not share the Government's expectations for inflation and expect a price rise of 8 per cent in 2014.
The main effect of the food bans will be combined with the possible introduction of a sales tax (NCP) in the Russian Federation regions in 2015.
Inflation peaks of 9% will take place in February, after which the annual rate of price growth will slow down, according to experts.
By the way, last week, Rossstat failed the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation imposed “soft sanctions”.
Aif.ru interviewed the experts and found out their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deyev, head of the analytical department of the FC AForex:
Prices are already rising for the main segments of the goods.
Moreover, when socially important products began to be valued, the Government was forced to initiate system-wide monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risk of undue price hikes in the short run.
Vendors and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to the regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when, and for what reason is inducing the price hike.
The key factors for the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the immense rate of capital outflow, the over-funding of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulator, the internal conversion due to the flight of the population to a foreign currency, and the embargo on the import of food products from countries that have acceded to the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressure had been kept under control, the cost of the basket of a minimum set of products would not have jumped by 12% in a quarter alone.
The ban on the import of food products has created a supply shock on the domestic market and has led to a very logical increase in the final cost.
As we are not in a position to fully implement the import-immunization mechanism at the current stage, as well as to make the Russian market more self-sustainable through domestic production, the sanctions will continue to bear the risk of inflationary growth.
By the end of this year, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent if the fiscal reasons for the lack of trust in the national currency, as well as the declining prospects for economic growth, are added.
Alexander Razuwaev, Director of the Alpari Analysis Department
Inflation in the 1990s was sometimes up to 20 to 30 per cent a month, and in the zeros it was also above the current level, another thing, that was offset by rapid economic growth.
I think the year's inflation will be 8-8.5 per cent.
Maguta Plato, VC Asset Manager, Maguta Foundation
The external factor associated with the sanctions against Russia has so far been successfully contained, but if there is a further rise in pressure, first of all on the financial sector, it can lead to certain difficulties and increase the inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually reflected in the purchase of the available currency in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the Government, the Russian Federation CB and the Ministry of Finance will try to soften the softening of the ruble by both market and state regulation.
But the price rise has traditionally begun after the summer quiet and may become more visible this fall.
Russia’s target of 7.5 per cent for consumer inflation is likely to stand, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
The horticultural centres are saddened by the decline in the number of landlords
This decline, due to an exceptional drop in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, can cause horticultural centres to lose tens of millions of pounds a year, when today's young consumers reach the “primary age of horticulture,” according to a study by HTA, reported by the Federal Times.
According to this report, renters spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount spent on horticulture by homeowners.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without orchards, the popularity of asphalting courtyards in front of the park, and the reduction of the size of the garden as other threats to an industry whose annual sales are estimated at £5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of landlords fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest level in Britain is spent on gardening goods per household.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society reported that renting a place and a lack of space for a garden do not mean that people can't grow a plant.
Guy Barter, the Chief Gardening Adviser at RHS, said, "Brancing in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can transport plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden age” of retail trade for horticulture, as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid 1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year, thanks to better weather after the adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture carried out mass-cleaning at the Earthland Foundation
Three of the four heads of the Earthland Foundation were replaced on Friday.
A total of three of the four heads of the Earthland Foundation were replaced on Friday.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture officially reported only the dismissal of the Executive Director of Atanas Dogov.
Lausanne Vasilev took his place.
It turned out that two of the three Fund ' s Deputy Executive Directors had been quietly replaced on Friday.
The Deputy Executive Director, Tatiana Angelov, who has been in charge of State aid and the SAPARD programme, has been released, informs BGNES by reference to the newspaper Trudd.
I didn't attend the Fund's Board of Governors, because by law we're not members of the board, but I was later told I was released.
I can't tell you why my resignation is not on the Foundation's website.
I'm on vacation.
"I hope I know more on Monday," said Angelov.
Ivanka Bagdadov, who was still the head of the "Investment Loan" at the Central Foundation in "Landland" in Sofia, will take her place.
The Deputy Executive Director, Nikolai Dachev, was also released.
So far, he was in charge of direct subsidies for the fields paid by the EU.
Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the Regional Directorate of the EarthDelia Foundation in the city of Velgo-Ternovo, will be appointed to his seat until January 2014.
Only the Deputy Chief of the Atije Foundation, Aliyev-Velí, continued her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the agency are not mentioned.
Turkey is calling an American diplomat in connection with a report of espionage
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey called the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent reported that the American Chargé d'affaires and Turkish officials had discussed the message on Monday.
The German journal Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept reported that the documents provided by a former US National Security Analyst, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a priority intelligence facility for American and British intelligence agencies.
According to the Turkish news agencies, the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyyip Erdoğan, has undercut the importance of this message, saying that all the leading countries are spying on each other.
Previous reports that the German General Intelligence Agency has also made Ankara a subject of intelligence have led to a more angered response from the Turkish Government.
The largest Chinese companies united against Alibaba
Chinese companies, among which the largest Chinese real-estate developer, Dalian Wanda Group, and Tencent Holdings (Society, Massenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese searcher) are setting up a company to compete in the online trade with Alibaba.
But catching up on the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which even left behind its American rivals, eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Union of Major
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, 70 per cent of which will be Vanda, and 15 per cent each of the Internet companies, says Wanda Group.
The company is scheduled to register in Hong Kong.
The SP will combine Baidu search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China, with about 438 million users), Tencent, and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 fashionable hotels, the Wanda group manages at least 49 commercial properties all over China and 40 shopping centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a movie studio and a theme park in Qindao (a city in the east of China on the shore of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors per year and to generate a profit of $960 million per year.
Wanda also owns the American AMC Entertainment Holdings Network, making the company the world's largest cinema operator.
By 2015, Wanda is planning to install all its shopping centres, hotels, and entertainment sites with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the newly created rival Alibaba.
According to Dun Ce, who will head the new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new site should be the world's largest online-to-offline platform, notes Dong Cet.
The point of online-to-offline (O2O) is to get customers on the Internet to go to regular offline shops or to buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the sale of coupons such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest "bird" in online commerce," said Wanda Van Jianlin (a quote from Bloomberg).
"Now there is no real O2O site in China, and in this situation everyone's chances are about the same," he says.
The Chinese Internet market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will more than triple by 2015 from 2011 to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, with Bloomberg data from official statistics: this is more than any country in the world, with the exception of India.
And it is projected that this number can grow to 850 million by 2015.
Union of the Rich
The head of Tencent Ma Huaten was the richest man in China until recently, but according to the Bloomberg millionaire index, the founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, has already outpaced it by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his share in Alibaba.
The Baidu leader, Robin Lee, is now ranked third among China's richest people, while Wang Jianlin of Wanda is number four.
"It's very interesting to see that the three richest men are working together to challenge the richer one," said Bloomberg, director of the China Center for E-Commerce Research in Hangzhou Tsao Lai.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Aliba right after it was created: "Rome can't be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not just rivaling not only new companies, but also the well-deserved leaders of the world's Internet trade is attested to in the previous year's report on the financial performance of Alibaba in the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as the middle of eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than the two American competitors combined.
Alibaba's net profit over the period is almost double the sum of the competitors - it has almost tripled in the year to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has an immense potential to generate money, thanks in large part to his mobile apps," comments Bloomberg's report to an Analyst from Hong Kong's Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba article on the US Securities and Exchange Commission's website, the company's active mobile users in July numbered 188 million, well above the March index (163 million).
In the last quarter, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions were on mobile devices.
Alibaba has to name the value of her shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 Bloomberg analysts, the company can be valued at $187 billion after the stock is sold.
According to Bloomberg, Alibaba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) can take place on September 16.
The Road-show company, which precedes this event, will start on September 3.
It is expected that Alibaba's release to the IPO will be record in the history of NYSE and will enable the company to attract about $20 billion.
So far, the United States stock market record has been in the Visa payment system, which in 2008 made an initial investment of $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food in the trade networks should be from Russia, and the deputies of the State do.
They have drafted a bill on the subject.
This is to be done by amending article 8 of the FM, on the basis of the State regulation of trade in the Russian Federation, and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, of at least 50 per cent of domestic products in shops should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are products that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in winter, so they will be given a “shortcut” to avoid possible discomfort to the buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amends the tax code of the Russian Federation, setting a lower rate of VAT of 10 per cent for the sale of all food items of which Russia is the country of origin, and reports to the newspaper Izvestia.
On 27 August, a bill was submitted to the lower House of Parliament to amend the FZ “On the Retail Markets”, which proposes to re-establish in Russia farm markets in which small-scale producers can sell their products.
Chief of Police, Magalufa, charged with corruption
The complainants submitted evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the State Attorney of Malorca on Friday.
The Chief of Police of Calvia in the Malorca resort was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar-owners in the scandalous Mafalufé’s unbridled drinking center.
The Chief Inspector, José Antonio Navarro, was detained as a result of allegations of corruption by a number of businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street on which most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the daily online Mallorca Diario, the complainants submitted evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the Malorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's office on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish National Guard on charges of corruption and will be interrogated by the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that the disgruntled owner of the nightclubs said that protectionism by the authorities seriously affected their business.
"The argument is no longer about making money, it's about surviving," said one of the businessmen to the court.
We cannot put our livelihoods at risk.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was hit in the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video, which showed an 18-year-old British vacationer blowing 24 men in a bar run.
The Island authorities have since tried to stop drunkenness among the resting Magaluf by minimizing the number of scandalous drinking runs in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where the blowjob incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and Carnage runners together were fined a y55,000 ($73000).
The Magaluf Tourist resort, mostly popular among young British vacationers, was also the scene of many accidents in a state of intoxication associated with the crazy fun known as "balconing", when people jump from one balcony to the next or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
WEEKS prepared a cold surprise in South Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide Airport.
A further 5 mm of rain fell on the city by 9:00 p.m., followed by 6.6 mm, which fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short rains with a stormy wind, including a storm that began just before 8:00 p.m. and spilled almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter released the early spring last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
The squalid conditions are expected to be one of the reasons for the delay in landing Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land right after 7:30 p.m., but hit the wind-shift zone - a sudden change in speed or a short-range wind - and was forced to get up.
The wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to rise during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay in the flight caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including the Emirates from Dubai and the Qantas from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is predicted in Adelaide on Tuesday, with the probability of one or two rains.
The costing of the construction facilities in the Russian Federation will be re-evaluated
The Federal Antimonopoly Service has special control over pricing, the regulation of the construction industry, as well as the problems of connection to the network.
The FAS has set up an expert council on the promotion of competition in the construction sector.
At the meeting, the head of the FAC Control, Construction and Natural Resources Office, Vadim Solovyev, stated that “the current calculation of the construction budget is completely incomprehensible”.
The regulatory framework renders pricing opaque and can result in an undue cost of construction, considered by the FAS.
And they suggest that the cost of building public property at the design stage should be based on market-price-based designs, instead of the current estimated standards and the single cost of technology operations.
The proposals have been included in the road map and are currently under consideration in a ministro.
“Replacing the traditional construction estimates with the design element calculations should result in less corruption in the industry,” explains Vadim Solovyev's WGB.
Because the cost estimates now count every bolt and ballet, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the records, unfaithful construction companies can bury “integrated tractors”.
In the ministro, the FAC agrees.
"The first work on the costing of the design elements is already in place: methodologies for the calculation of the cost of the design solutions, the calculation of the cost estimates for these indicators, "speaked by the Head of the Department of Urban Planning and the Architecture of the Minster, Helena Zhukov.
Road construction has been selected as a pilot.
The experts, however, believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the head of the Pro-Invest Building Company, Anatoly Demianco, has said, the estimated standards have long been out of date, but no other business mechanism has yet been proposed.
“As far as the proposed design calculations are concerned, in practice this is difficult to implement, as the construction of buildings often uses very different technologies”, he argues.
It's no secret that the construction market is developing in large part thanks to government order.
According to the Chairman of the NP “Expert Community of Professionals of State Order”, Catherine Lezine, today the State is the best-paying customer.
The Deputy Director of Engineering of the Rosatom Capital Building Industry Center, Vladimir Malakhov, has noted that today the market is subject to conditionally split into companies that have access to the portfolio of contracts, and to companies that have monopolies and do not allow competitors to do so.
He believed that a transparent market could be created only if access to contracts was as secure as possible from someone ' s influence.
The Expert Council has been called upon to form a system of public order in such a way that the same performer is not entitled to more than one contract of more than 1 billion roubles or more than 1 billion roubles.
In the ministros, it is believed that this approach needs to be assessed in terms of business impact as well as the efficiency of building management.
As Elena Zhukov explained, in this case it would be necessary to assign the employer the functions of the contractor, which would result in an increase in the number of the customer and the budget for its maintenance.
In doing so, the client ' s expertise will need to be able to assess the quality of the work performed by the contracting organizations, as well as their safety.
Often, such a disaggregation will need to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly qualified bidders due to a lack of interest in obtaining a public order for part-time work and a small sum of the contract.
The vice-chairs of the Institute of Purchasing and Expert Consultation Centre, Alexander Eustashchenkov, believe that the State-ordered procedure has now become a business game for the care of the contractor.
An example was given: “a participant in the application must state `specific' without the words `or equivalent', `must be', `to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', 'to be', "to be', "to be" etc.
Thus, clients often abuse their right to prescribe the content of an application submitted by the contracting organizations.
Another problem 44-FZ, in the view of Eustashchenkov, was the need to assess the quality of work at the application stage through the participant's paper-based proposal.
In considering the participant ' s application, it is only the qualifications of the contractor, but not the quality of the work that has not even begun, that is, the expert suggests.
The quality of the work can be assessed only when it is accepted.
The expert board also proposed that the margin of income from the top to the lower echelon be moved to the point where the intermediate contractors would disappear.
The Chairman of the Council of Experts, the State Secretary, the Deputy Head of FAS, Andrej Czarikovsky believes that this is not the case, as the contractor must be responsible for the order.
Or it'll be like in a well-known reprisal of Arkady Rykin's Athele: "Do you have a problem with buttons?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip again went to school on Monday, after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and mines fell on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as the Territory was rebuilt after the fighting.
The start of the school was a source of joy and arousal to the rocket-affected settlements in southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the south city of Ashdod, the Pashos Kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed traces of fragments from the walls and rollers before the students arrived.
"We're a bit afraid, but we're happy to look to the future," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Sa'ad and an English-language teacher at his school.
It is true that many children in our area need to return to a normal life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that suddenly she'd start going back to school "a bit odd."
"It was a hard time, and we didn't leave our homes at all," she said.
President Reven Rivlin visited the kibbutz, which is close to the Gaza border, to express his support.
Before the ceasefire halted the war last week, thousands of people in border settlements, such as Sa'ad, did not go out or left their homes, moving to safer areas far from the Gaza Strip to escape from rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a fragment of a Palestinian mine, are in doubt of the need to go back.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which had made a great deal of effort from the Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study carefully and said, "We will do our best to give you knowledge and to keep you safe."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately put an end to the fighting, but key issues remained to be resolved, such as the Hamas demand to lift the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its arms and return the bodies of the two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
A new phase of the proximity talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians, three quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, as estimated by the Palestinian side and the United Nations, have been killed.
Israel contests these figures and states that at least half of the people killed were militants; however, it has not provided any material evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gazan militants fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged and demolished, and it is estimated that 250,000 people have taken refuge in more than 100 schools, which have been converted into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in the shelters and the fighting continued, the education officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon open up so we can complete our education, like the children of the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammed Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in a school in Gaza.
According to the popular criterion, real property prices have shown the highest winter growth in seven years.
The housing cost index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for the Australian capital rose by 1.1 per cent in August, and RP data was reported by RP data on Monday.
This increase has led to a combined increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double that of 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
The director of RP Data, Tim Lowless, reported that Sydney and Melbourne run a two-tier market.
Figures of RP Data show that in Sydney, the price of housing rose by 16.1 per cent in the last year, while in Melbourne it rose by 11.7 per cent.
The next major markets were Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin, where the average price rose from 5 to 6 per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government cost cuts took place, where prices rose by just 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lowless said that, now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties put on the market within the next few months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"Bearing in mind the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current conditions with low interest rate, it is likely that the cost of housing will still grow in the next three months," he said.
How do people live in the oldest house of Ufa?
In the former home of the gold and miners of Yevdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October revolution, the former Greater Casana, there are 18 apartments.
The 18th-century house has not changed much since it was built, except for the old age.
Foreigners go here as a tour, and the tenants are more affected than they are happy, by their privilege of living in the oldest Ufim house, whose walls remember General Alexander Suvorov.
The date of the building is not accurate, and the historians point to two dates, 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out the building is not 300 years old.
Old courtyard, always open door, violin stairwell.
The doors to the apartment are located close to each other, the walls are cracked, and the street is visible in the light of the shrouded plaster.
Seems like it's all about being honest.
And the locals say, "You don't think it is."
Living in an 18th-century wooden house is very hard, says Tatiana Lucianova, a resident of apartment number 3.
The object is on the state's guard, but the money for it hasn't been spent for decades, and we feel like museum artifacts that the authorities have just forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still clinging, but the foundations are rotting.
Many of the tenants still go to the toilet outside, and they wash once a week in a public bath.
How can you be content in such circumstances?
The road goes right under the windows, there's not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana is moving the curtain.
Now you can see what you've just heard before: there's a traffic stream under the windows.
You see, the windows are dizzy all the time, we can't open the windows, we're used to the noise.
You get used to it, you get used to it, you get used to it.
Our apartment is still fine, thanks to his husband, his hands are golden.
Plus, we have two rooms, the three of us with our son.
And other families have a much worse environment, and on the second floor, the ceilings are a little over a foot high.
To contrast, Tatiana is offering a visit to a neighbor from apartment 6 to Ludmile Old Man.
A nice, hospitable woman at the door offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a single-room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live with my husband and my daughter and my granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been another place, and Ludmila's eye-scrolling a room: antressoli, two sofas with a letter of "g"; one of them is a granddaughter with a laptop.
It's very narrow, and it's not much different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical."
But from the ceiling, the water system is not good.
Ludmila speaks of her apartment at the same time as an Italian woman whose home is on Roman ruins.
I mean, it's one very old and recent, daily and legendary thing:
The water duct was run about 40 years ago during the last repairs.
At the same time, we got a small kitchen in a box and a toilet from the former cupboard.
We live just where Demidov and his family lived on the second floor.
Our apartment isn't privatized, and why?
At the Ufa Real Estate Center, it's said that privatisation doesn't matter.
We'll get a single-room apartment anyway, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, they promised to dissipate us, but it didn't go any further.
I'm not used to complaining, and I'm not gonna.
In this apartment (room!) there was a dynasty: my grandparents, my mom and dad, my husband and my daughter and my granddaughter.
Things have been going on in that time.
For example, big rats ran in the kitchen.
Look at the wall of the fridge, it's a metre thick!
They say the solution was on the balls, so it lasts so long.
The house is well built, thanks to Demids!
That's probably the only reason why no one's been killed by a falling ceiling or his own.
Only the building is still slowly dying in front of us: the planks and logs of the house rot, the floors have fallen, we have been licking with cement, but it's not worth it, the solution goes to the ground, like a well.
They say it is, under our room a secret lair and a move to the White River, which was especially made by the old men who once lived here to be able to escape the danger, in case.
They've been chased.
Ludmila Old Austin tells us how some historian came to see them, begged to let him start digging in the apartment.
And then he convinced me to give them a place to live in exchange for one of his own at the October Avenue.
Ludmila to the historian refused:
Where are we four in one?
And here, there's a small hope that it'll make the place more spacious.
If we agreed to the trade, we wouldn't have won anything.
The Old Ones didn't win anything, though.
Ludmila's biggest dream to be scattered, and her 16-year-old daughter was given a separate room.
So for two families, a two-bedroom apartment has been set aside instead of the most majestic ruins in which two generations live.
The cute, miniature girl Olesha Karsakov from apartments 11 and 12 shows up on the second floor of the house.
There, in two small rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, her large family lives.
There are seven of us, two of us.
You can see what the conditions are.
The groove falls off with bits, as do the window frames, in the walls of the kitchen and in the rooms, holes in the holes.
The water in the crane is cold all year.
As you go through the apartments of the oldest house in Ufa, you can make sure that the Lorrentyev wives in apartment number four are the happiest.
They're occupying the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of space!
It's a 75-square space, it's been written by three people.
We live in the right room where the legend is that Suvorov was staying in Ufa, says the family head Alexander Dmitriyevich Lawrence.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One bad thing is, everything's cracking up, falling apart, falling apart.
Neighbors must have told you!
The most agony we have with the floors is that the wooden planks are rotting, the ground is literally getting out of the way.
I've put up the sockets, the bows, and there's nothing in the hall, and in the other room, we're swinging like a swing, it's so shaky.
Alexander Dmitriyevich can best tell about the house of the merchant Eudokim Demidov.
A gold-producer is viewed as a native, and he speaks with admiration.
In fact, the identity was unique: the owner of the Kagin and Ushan factories built houses, licked guns and bells, and held Ural mines.
The heirs of the property are proud to be an ancestor, but they don't want to live under the same roof as history.
I settled here as a child in the 1940s, says Alexander Dmitriyevich.
Then there were wooden carriages, stables, and guard booths, then demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to clean up our house, but something was in the way...
The story recursed in 2014, and it was once again lured to a new place.
As a command, we got all the files, ran the right offices, and all of a sudden, we found out that moving to the apartments was moving to 2015 or 2016.
Somethin' no longer believe in all this...
Two years ago, Lawrence went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashcortostan to learn about the fate of the home.
The tenants didn't take the tenant.
Sent from one table to another, and then, as a mockery, a paper without a sign and a stamp, "The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the settlement of the tenants."
I even get the feeling that our home has been out of town for a long time, because it was first number 57, then it was 57 A, and now it's 57/1.
It's like it's been demolished in the '70s.
The Russian Planet has been approached by the head of the Information and Analysis Branch of the Ufa Land Office, Vladimir Barabash.
The House on the street of the October revolution, 57/1, is part of the old-age settlement programme.
I can't be held responsible for the actions of the officials of the 1970s, but I know there was a plan at the time to demolish all old homes, despite the historical significance.
Luckily, this has not been the case, and the decision of modern authorities to rebuild all the old homes on the street of the October revolution, which are of architectural value, has been successfully implemented.
The residents are about to be resettled in new apartments.
According to Barabash, the reconstruction of the Demidov House will be done by Italian specialists who have been involved in the renovation of the buildings in Venice.
Italy now has an architectural biennal, and the Old Ufa project is presented there, among other things.
I hope that by 2016, the entire old Kasan Street will be restarted, says the official.
Homes will be of the right kind, in line with what was earlier, three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to be an open museum for all.
In addition, a decision has been made at the Government level to make the street a walker on weekends.
On weekdays, unfortunately, it's not gonna work, too much of the city's roads.
He promises to resettle people from a future museum, Vladimir Barabash, in 2015.
In fact, it is unlikely that they will be content: their new apartments will be the same size as the current ones.
Only from another era.
A forest fire broke out in Primorje because of the storm.
The dry storm has led to a forest fire in the area of the Hunting Landscape in the Primorsky Region.
There is a build-up of forces and assets at the site of the fire.
The conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of the air force, according to the management of the Air Force.
Basili Medvedev, Deputy Chief of the Air Base:
A fire in a hard-to-reach area was detected by an observer pilot from an An-2 patrol aircraft in an area of 3 hectare.
The wood left on the old burner is on fire.
The strong obscurity of the area and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable fire-landing sites pose a major problem in the carnage.
We need an MI-8.
The movement of forces by the MI-2 and AN-2 aircraft at the airbase is very difficult.
After the discovery of the fire, four parachute firemen were quickly disembarked.
The main task of the specialists is to put out the fire and to set up a site for the delivery of additional fire-extinguishing equipment.
In the area of lunch, an additional three paratroopers were transported to the village of the Hunting Helicopter.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the fire area is ready, the specialists will be moved to the location of the carnage, on the website of the Primorsky State Administration.
My dad never hugged me.
Never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to an immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley in Midland in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19 years old, worked in the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry's rehearsing a comedy, "The Roots of Rudy", which is based in part on imaginary conversations with his dad and grew up in a series of radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, and the melodies are happy.
But Henry had to get through some of the hard memories of childhood.
After his mother's death, there was "a lot" of treatment, and Henry's often thinking about his dad's relationship.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've just heard his voice, "Stop the fuss.
Get off your sister.
Come on!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were old when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the form of a beer, the beauty of a punch in a cricket.
I've never talked to him like that.
He was such a smug guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a lithing shop in Dudley and, although the conditions were better than in his father's day, he was able to see what his life must have been.
It's a bit better now, but it's the dark, smoky, depths of the labyrinths of the underworld with fire and smoke and a lot of soot.
My dad was in the bathtub and just lay there, and you heard him sing for himself slowly because he wanted to wash off the lithium shop.
When I got there, I realized he'd been doing it for years and years to earn us a living, and I started to value him more.
Still, Henry got out of childhood without parental love.
My dad never hugged, never said, "I love you."
Only when mom got sick at the very end of her life, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he needed when he was a kid.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, who he's been married to for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother himself was diabetic.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So, when I got very, very well and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to take radical action.
So I started a serious fitness class, and I also had to go to a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one's eating carrots.
The change in Henry's career trajectory may be reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Ever since he got a confession from the critics for his Othello, he's gone to the theater.
Followed the "Fault comedy" and then August Wilson's "Faults."
This work differs from sitcoms and comedy, which were an inseparable attribute of his rich professional life.
He began his career when he was 16 and worked in the factory.
DJ spotted him imitating on the stage, and wrote about him in "The New Faces."
His TV career began in the middle of the '70s: "For a long time, I was the only black parodist/comic on TV."
He was at work.
I didn't just have to grow up in front of the public, but I had to learn to be an effective fun delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on TV, and it was very hard.
Lanie in the "New Person" in 1975
Since his manager was entitled to the "Black and White Show Malestroke", a light entertainment program in which people "blacked their faces," Henry found out he was in it for five years.
My family didn't like it.
I kind of want it to never happen to me, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange, reprehensible position, I was working on the big spots and learning to work with the crowd.
But what was "the award-winning light entertainment classical on British TV for years and years" was "the black man's game parody."
Imagining the characters who used to bully the black culture in Britain and sing it, Henry worked in an alternative comedy project in the '80s.
The first season of "Lennie Henry's Show" was aired in 1984, and in the '90s he was known, among other things, as Chef Gareth Blacklock of "Shef!" comedy.
The commercials, the documentarys, the TV series, and the role in the movie took over the next 10 years of his life, but after his show on BBC in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "what are you gonna do next, Len, 'cause it's a little bit like you're dragging time or slowing it down."
And then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 titled "What's Good in...?"
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
You can't say I'm being taught that in high school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of the middle-class white people with panties and cabbage at the bottom of the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we've been interviewing for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You need to try.
Don't swear it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of those words out loud, and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 strings of Othello's last monologue for a document transfer, and he got caught.
I got the feeling I could do it.
It's like my head's been fixed.
"That's what this is, it's a big deal, take it seriously, learn your text, do a little study.
So the rehearsal process was hard, and I've been reading this play months and months before we set it up.
And she was a success.
They seemed to have been waiting for a disaster, and it didn't.
Soon we started the "Failure Comedy."
All of a sudden, I'm at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it to the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt his business was to entertain the public.
"A quiet voice inside me said, "you're gonna have to work for 10 minutes while they're fixing the computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my job.
I can let someone else deal with it.
"You play in the play, stay in the role."
Henry's in "the fences" at the Duchess Theatre.
It was hard to learn the text for "the fences."
Panic's pretty good, it's got a lot of muscle.
She was also well-accepted, so it was like a sign from the top, showing, "That's what you have to do."
He's saying it, of course, with a loud voice.
So I'm sticking to it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the rehearsal.
By the way, Henry still has a comedian's mind - all the way to our conversations, it's the outbursts of his humour, and when he starts, he's finished imagining.
I just decided not to work in a stand-up, because this thing with the instant reward from a full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you're going to do this all the time, it could be a dead end.
I sometimes work at Apollo Lives when I want to, but I don't really enjoy it as much as I used to.
I'm asking if he'll ever give the stand-up again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the start, the middle, and the end of the path -- I don't think I'd ever want to give up on it.
So this is his new embodiment?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and this is a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya is registering civil servants to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya began a biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government's payroll.
Staff members who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid are referred to in the Government application.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Keniata has promised to reduce corruption in public institutions since he took office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million ($700,000) a month was lost by payments to “invisible workers” and other financial irregularities.
The Government suspects that wages continue to go to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports BBC reporter Wangyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All public servants are required to report to the identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data will be collected by means of a biometric registration procedure, as reported in the Government application.
Anyone who does not do so without a valid reason will be struck off the payroll, as reported.
“This procedure will contribute significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of the Government - thus putting an end to the problem of `invisible workers', said Ann Wygour, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers for the Planning and Structuring of Power.
Dozens of Turkish police officers have been arrested in connection with a “conspiracy” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the Government”, reports local news agencies.
The police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriet Daly News.
Some of them participated in last December in a corruption-detection exercise, which was aimed at vetting Government officials, including four Government ministers.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of establishing an organized criminal group and tapping a phone.
The Turkish President, Regep Tayyyip Erdoğan (then Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of the measures being taken against him and others in power, by the Islamic cleric Fathullah Gülen.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (1 September) after the summer vacation.
This day has traditionally been a big event for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenius Yazenyuk has taken his daughter to school.
There he told the expectant reporters that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do his best to protect the country for future generations:
The first September ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful sky.
The entire Ukraine, the vast unified Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexan Pastukhov, headmaster of a school in Slavansk, where his daughter, Jacenyuk, went to, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future life.
The first day of the school is traditionally marked by the fact that children wear embroidered shirts, hold balloons in their hands, and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, he may have found the impressive leader she needs.
It is followed by a glow of fame from the world of banking, media administration, and the Tory Party's internal circles.
In fact, she has her own experience in senior positions.
Her career began at the Bay and Co Global Management Consulting Company, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the Pearsons media world.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, retiring when a male co-worker in a lower position in Pearson's head company.
It is said that her earnings are close to £1 million.
Its political ratings are also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of the BP, when he was trying to bring private-sector experts to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet.
Her husband was Tori's former counselor.
Previously, in May, I called the Chairman's work a poisoned cup.
The BBC is not just a massive and complex organization in the very heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two focussings: inside as the top level of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but out as a voice of public concern and upheaval when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopoly, which requires complete radical reform.
But what new president would risk coming, trampling and ruining an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he were to lose his job in the process.
It's a hard decision.
It wouldn't be so hard, so a lot of people would be happy to see the BBC go down in size, after a redefinition of its powers, finance, and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies defy cozy old habits, inevitable negotiations on the value of a license pose a particular risk to BBC.
For a modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British take a share in the world's most definitely the largest media company.
BBC tells a good story: it states that the results of its work cover 96 per cent of the households and are only 40p a day for each of them.
In fact, Beeb’s popularity is clearly on the rise: 53% support it today, up from 31% 10 years ago.
The BBC model has changed: I now get news headers on my mobile phone and watch the missed program on the iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope it's found it.
Perry from Texas says that a humiliating tweet was written by an outsider.
The tweet from the confirmed account of the Texas Governor of Republican Rick Perry on Sunday night contained an insulting image of the D.A. from the Demokrats, who is in the center of the prosecution for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another one from Perry's account, in which the tape was dissuaded.
I just got a tweet from my account, which was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I got it out," a later record.
The assistants of Perry did not immediately respond to the communications with a request for comment.
Although the records were downloaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was not clear who was in the real position to publish it.
The earlier tweet contained an unfaithful cartoon on the DA of the County of Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who was found guilty of driving in a state of intoxication in April 2013.
Perry banned funding for her office when she refused to resign, which led to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 elections.
The sign on the tweet says, "I don't always drive a car in a state of intoxication that is three times as high as the acceptable level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I'm blaming Governor Perry for telling me about it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg didn't conduct an investigation with a grand jury against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political trick.
His strong legal team has asked the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the indictment, saying that the law that is used to persecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is vague, which is in conflict with the Constitution.
Perry has halted funding for $7.5 million from the state's State Public Control Department, which is based in Travis County, to pursue corruption in the Texas public sector, when Lemberg refused to resign.
The Veto has raised a formal complaint from a public control group with a left-handed view.
The tape of Perry's confirmed account is often updated, and sometimes it becomes a celebrity.
At the fifth Iowa Party Congress during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry responded to rumours that he could quit the game by tweeting a picture of himself running next to the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to the "normal state"
One of London's best-known developers warned that the real estate market in south-eastern England has "returned" to normal levels of activity.
Homes in the capital have been the subject of lively demand and fast-growing prices, with widespread fear that the credit bubble will push Bank of England to set limits on mortgages in June.
Tony Peedley, the founder and chairman of Berkeley's elite construction company, said on Monday, "Since the start of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013, "and this has provided a "stable working environment."
The London real estate market was successful during the recession, as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
The city's prices rose by 18.5 per cent in the last year alone, according to the Land Cadastre, significantly outpacing the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for private, affordable, and student schemes of Berkeley rose by about one fifth last year, reaching £423000 at the end of April.
But the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also halted the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around a potential “mansion tax” before the next May general election.
The London Foxtons Real Estate Agency last week warned that the April reform of the mortgage market, under which stricter loan conditions have been introduced, would also result in a decline in market growth in both real-estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgages in June, suggesting a further cooling of the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its forecast of a rise in London real estate prices for 2015 to 3 per cent, on the basis of the fact that real estate prices have begun to weaken.
In the meantime, transactions fell by a quarter over the previous year in the most expensive parts of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair, and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
Still, the demand for houses in the capital was very lucrative for Berkeley, raising the volume of sales above £2,2 billion.
Mr. Peedley added, "The demand for the right item with the best design and the best location has remained the same and, reflecting it, the sales have continued for a long time."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes this year by the end of April, about a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
The annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 per cent from the previous year to £380 million, and the income rose by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Peedley announced that the expected revenues of Berkeley for this year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of the analysts, a profit of £450 million is expected for the whole year prior to the payment of taxes.
Berkeley's stock was held at £23.96 in the afternoon on the London Exchange.
Photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence are online by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence is on her way to the 85th annual American Film Academy award.
Photos of a nude actress, Jennifer Lawrence, who won the Oscar award, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to have a cataloguing picture of another 100 stars.
A representative of the star of the Hunger Games confirmed that Lawrence's picture was real, and he denounced the hacker for "invasion of private space."
The law enforcement authorities have been contacted, and they will be following anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photographs originally posted on the 4chan photo-sharing site are allegedly due to a lack of Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged “catalogue” of the victims of the break-in includes the names of dozens of women, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is not clear how many of these images are real, though the star "Scott Pilgrim Against All" Winstead on Twitter also denounced the break-in.
"Those who look at the photos that we took with my husband a few years ago, in private at home, - I hope you're proud of yourself," Winstead tweeted.
But Victoria Justiz, from Nikolodeon "iCarly" and "Victoria the Winner", denied that in the photos she tweeted: "These so-called pictures of me naked, people.
Let me stop it in the foetus.
Buzzfeed told me last Sunday that a representative of the pop star, Ariana Grande, denied that the photos on which she was believed to be real.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's novel of love and the letter "J" that lauded the critics.
They dissolved, and that's the best way to say it, and they slowly fell apart, like a box of cardboards left behind in the rain.
Only at times did a woman tell him that he was too serious, hard to communicate, tense, closed, and perhaps a bit irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw irritability in himself.
He was stew-like, yeah.
The last victim of this detestable thing was a small affair, from which he expected more than usual to be freed from a lonely and boring life, and perhaps even some sort of satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a tremblingly fragile lady with shaved hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village, even more remote and severe than Port Royben.
She came to the south with a companion older than herself, who Kever thought her aunt was, the last one to inherit a house in a raw but paradise-like valley, the joyous name of which is "Paradise Valley."
No one's been in the house for years.
The pipes flowed, in the bathtubs, the spiders, the slugs left their tracks on all the windows, confident that the house was theirs; the garden was full of weeds, like giant crows of cabbage.
It was like a cottage from a kid's book, both frightening and enchanting, with a complete secret garden.
The author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose "J" novel was included in the Booker Lounge in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Eileenn sat by the hand, in the broken sheds of high grass, enjoying the sudden warm spring day; they both tampered with the cheap console, which provided the country with quiet music and quiet news, when, after glance at her crossed brown legs, he remembered the old song of a long-forgotten black performer, who his father loved to listen to by putting the curtains in the house.
You've got too big a leg.
Because of their aggressive nature, songs of this kind on the console were no longer played.
They weren't banned - nothing was actually banned - just no more losing.
They've been helped to become archaic, like the very word "archaic."
Public taste was doing things that would never have been achieved by orders and regulations, and just as people in the books selected memoirs of rich people who grew up in poverty, cookbooks and love novels, they selected ballads from all the music.
After enjoying this day, Kevern began to play on an imaginary piano and a ruthless, comical voice to sing Eilynn's big legs.
Eileenn didn't get it.
"It was a popular jazz pianist's song called Fats Waller," he said to her, putting two fingers on her lips.
That's what his dad always did to stop the letter "J" before it went off his lips.
It began with a game they played when he was a kid.
His dad played it with his dad, as he told him.
Start with "J," forgetting to put two fingers on your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew he was supposed to do it, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileenn never heard it.
Jazz didn't play, either, even though it was not outright banned.
Improvisation's out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the tune began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with wit.
His unpredictability was getting on people's nerves.
And jazz was the wit of music.
Although he was 10 years old, never heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kever knew about a jazz from his dad's semi-secret CD-ROM collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileenn that Fats Waller was black.
In view of her age, she hardly remembers a time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no law or pressure.
Society was obedient, which meant that every segment of it agreed to the thanks - the thanks of those who had been spared - for the principle of group predisposition.
People of African-Caribbean origin, in temperament and physical traits, were well suited for entertainment and sport, and sang and ran.
The Indians, as if by nature talented in everything about electronics, have taken on the task of making sure that no family is left without an online phone.
What was left of the Polish Diaspora was doing plumbing; what was left of the Greek was slapping dishes.
The people from the Persian Bay and the Levant, whose grandpa didn't get out of the country fast, when what happened, if the world was going to happen, out of fear of being accused of arson, in fear, in fact, that the fire would swallow them up next, open up restaurants with labynettes and booby-tips, and shook up, and sank at nothing.
To everyone by their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads before, Eileenn was hard to see how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could have been put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," said Kevin.
Unless maybe for people with big legs.
My dad never offended anyone, but he loved the song.
He said too much, but the running garden gave him an illusion of safety.
No word could penetrate the sound insulation of the giant leaves, which look like cabbage.
Eileenn still didn't get it.
How could your dad like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on her lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in a bad way, shutting down the eye of Cavern.
There was nothing in the whole world but a corsage of her black hair.
Nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if you say so," she said, staying in her mind.
But it still doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big a leg?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Ankles, maybe a bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too soon.
"I like you just because you have fat ankles," he tried to say instead.
I'm so perverted.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Tried to make a joke often made him uncomfortable, for, like his father, he was lacking in a soothing charm that would alleviate the cruelty of the jokes.
Maybe his dad wanted to be brutal.
Maybe he wanted to, too, kever.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and rose from the shed, overturning the console and spilling the wine they had been drinking.
The booze wine, so the intoxication couldn't justify it.
In her excitement, she seemed to be trembling like palm leaves in a storm.
"I like you because you have a dumb head," she said...
I don't like it, though.
He was sorry for her and for the rudeness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her eye when she repelled him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that, in the main, she was like this place.
The same big ice ocean fell on both of them.
The same misguided men, even more sensitive and whimsical after what happened, if their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered in fury from the pub to the pub, ready to raise their hand on any woman who dared to say no or tease them.
Dumb head?
They'd show her a dumb fist if she wasn't careful!
First a kiss - a kiss is now the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; an antidote to the fresh ballad that the console gave - to kiss her first and then to hit her.
An overstatement, according to Kevern, was because kissing itself was already a hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons on the building showed him he needed to go.
He got up out of the bar like an old man.
She felt the burden of lead herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She was watching him go, and from the top window, she was watching him go, and her companion was a man who himself was a hard man.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a need for empathy for him and for men at all, even though some of them put a hand on her.
The man who turned his back on her, with his back bent, shy, shattered, all the ability to fight left him - why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember a single thing, until today, when she would see it?
Again, one Eileen Solomons looked at her legs.
Twenty years before the above-mentioned events or so on, Esme Nussbaum, a smart and robust 32-year-old researcher who worked at the Offnau, the informal Public Intensity Watch, has prepared a small report on the persistence of low and medium levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to be reduced if it did not stop at all, taking into account the means and forces that have been devoted to its elimination.
"A lot has been done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "to soften the innate aggressiveness of the people who fought in the thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these misguided branches and narrow splinters of the land, where, despite the swaggering swathes of churches, the tender breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in history.
Some qualities, however, seem to be inexhaustible.
The higher the spire, the lower the passions it is.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows up stories of overwhelmed hurdles, and announces its ferocious belief in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does the old rudeness continue to be strong both in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is also evidence that new and bitter rancidity is emerging in homes, workplaces, on the roads and even on playgrounds.
"You have a frustrating habit of writing too much," said her research manager, reading the report in its entirety.
I think you should read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum put her head down.
I also have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you gay?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I'm asking," finally said Luther Rabinitz, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbism, or feminism.
We don't have any prejudices here.
We are the servants of the community without prejudice.
But some sorts of hyperresponsibility, completely acceptable and laudable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, like what you've shown me.
Obviously, you are the one who is preconceived against the Church, and what you call "vilest" and "gross," others would interpret as an expression of natural life and energy.
To continue to be sick of what was happening if the world was sick, as if it had happened, if ever, yesterday, was to deprive the country of the life it needed.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinitz was talking.
Behind his head, pink, like flamingo, the LEDs echoed the tips that Offnau had given to the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, value your husband, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, talk, explain, listen, say yes, apologise.
Talking is better than silent, the word of a song is better than a written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I fully understand what you're trying to say," replied quietly to Esme Nussbaum, when she made sure her research manager was finished talking, "and I don't want to say anything but that we have not been cured as effectively as we are persuading ourselves.
I am concerned that, if we are not ready, we will find that we are repeating the mistakes that have led to the very beginning of what has been done, if the world has come to an end.
Only this time, we will cast out our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinitz put his fingertips together in a piramide.
That gesture was supposed to mean endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "referring to `mistakes' the actions that our grandfathers have or have not done.
You go too far, and when you talk about them throwing their anger and their distrust on "others."
In your place, a man should not need to be reminded that by understanding the past, that is, by protecting the present, we don't talk about "us" and "they."
There was no "us" and there was no "other."
It was a time of mess - that's all we know.
"For which, to be honest with herself," dared to put Esme in, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what's done is done.
It was then.
You don't have to say anything else, we agree here.
And as no one should be blamed, you don't have to justify it if it was appropriate or if there was something you could fix.
But why the past, if not to learn -
The past exists to make us forget it.
If I can add one word to this -
The Pyramid Luther Rabinitz fell apart.
"I will review your report," he said, releasing her.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who was on the sidewalk, as the passers-by described, "in anger."
Coincidences happen.
The Army of Lesotho states that the coup was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The Army of Lesotho denied that a coup to overthrow the Government had been set up, claiming that they had acted against the police, who had been suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane left the country, claiming that the country ' s army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in Maseru.
The Premier took his family to neighbouring South Africa, claiming to have been threatened with an attack on his life.
The army spokesman, Major Ntlelet Ntoi, said that there was no real coup, but that the army was responding to a threat from the "political fanatics" that the police tried to arm.
“What happened this morning was that the command of the Armed Forces of Lesotho took action by receiving a number of intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police that are actually planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who have been ready to cause chaos,” he reported to the American Voice.
A South African government spokesman, Clayson Monjela, said that the army's actions looked like a coup.
“Although no one has claimed to take power by force, according to all the information, the actions of the Armed Forces of Lesotho so far have the main signs of a coup,” he said.
The Army of Lesotho reported that the soldiers had returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mottejoa Metsing is running the government in the absence of Tabane.
Thabane stated that he believed he was under attack in an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Thabane suspended the parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his unified Government.
He stated that his actions had not undermined the Government, despite allegations of the contrary.
Chelsey's half-defendant, Marco van Ginkel, will spend the coming season on a lease in Milana, reports Milan Channel.
A 21-year-old Dutchman will be arriving in Italy in the next hours for a medical examination.
Last season, he only went to the London Club field three times.
Let's remind you that earlier, Milaan leased from Liverpool to the attacker, Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at the lowest rate in 13 months
Growth in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The last value of the eurozone’s Business Index (PMI) on Markit fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed, and enterprises have been hit by a growing strain between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The values precede the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will expect the bank to have a clear plan on how to cope with the eurozone’s recovery, as well as the risk of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is a suggestion that ECB head Mario Draghi may give further signal later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone, similar to those used by the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the brake effect of growing economic and geo-political uncertainty on producers is becoming more evident," said Rob Dobson, the senior economist Markit.
The PMI of the German manufacturing sector, Russia's largest trade partner in the EU, fell to the lowest 51.4 in 11 months.
In the meantime, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a source of real concern, as does Italy ' s weakening from stable growth to stagnation.
The signs that growth has faded in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add confidence,” said Mr. Dobson.
The slowing down of the industry is likely to add oil to the fires for analysts who are waiting for the introduction of additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI has grown to 57,3 its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economist of the IHS Global Insight, said, "The best thing to say about the August business index of the eurozone's production sector is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: “The producers of the eurozone seem to find life very hard at the moment, as the current upsurge in geo-political tensions - especially those related to Russia/Ukrainian - add uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has apparently hit the business - and especially the consumer confidence - and is likely to result in some of the orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially the big ones.
He said "more and more like it," that the ECB would, of course, have to do some kind of quantitative mitigation, "although we suspect it will be limited."
The people of Mariupol will set up a live chain against the militia.
In Mariupol, until last week, it was quiet - no one was trying to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Azov Sea lived and worked.
Now the people are horrifyingly waiting for the "militia" to come.
According to the polytologists, the separatists are breaking into Mariupol to get to the Sea of Azov - a city of Novoazovsk was recently taken, which was not a part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupols decided that the Ukrainian army, even though it would defend them, had a bit of a force against the well-armed members of the NPD-LDC, and they were going to help the military.
They're digging trenches, building roadblocks and reinforcements.
On Saturday evening, a number of thousands of people arrived on the eastern border of the city, and they rose up in a living chain singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They're gonna do the same in the event of an attack.
The volunteers collect and transport equipment and food, collect medicine, publish a newspaper.
The city is gradually shutting down shops, shutting down banks and ATMs.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the terrible takeover of the school, like the children who have been in it still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were children, were killed during this three-day test, which shocked the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated on death during the school atrocity.
Just 10 years after the terrible takeover of the Neslan school, in which 334 people, including 186 children, died, the heroic survivors of the catastrophe last night warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, seized and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the start of a new quarter, it seemed to be some sort of extreme evil.
Tragedy has united the East and the West in a disgust, which in an amazing way has then turned into action and hope for the future in the face of the bitterest woe.
Ten years later, we went back to Beslan in South Russia to find some of the victims who cheated on death during the school atrocity.
We've found amazing young people who have stood up to the troubles, even though the memory of the terror hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that currently plagues Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now end.
The girl in the picture is trying to get back in the shelling gym.
It is recorded in a picture of a well-known Russian photographer, Dmitri Belyakov, when in one of his underwear he tried to get back into the shelling gym after the mine exploded.
In the confusion of Hades, she was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There was a fear that both of them had died, but in fact, they had survived.
"The woman told me to run as hard as I could, but I couldn't," said Hades.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
Soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she'd fully recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago the pain was back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few fragments left in my knee.
Her goal now is to be a dentist, to help people the way the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it certainly didn't break it," she says with a challenge.
"It's happened to me, and you can't change that fact.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who's been there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it any other day.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dr. Gapoev was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we wanted to go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the takeover stays with her, though the memory is a bit dazzling every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our misfortune, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from Britain and everywhere.
When I see a picture on the Internet where I go through a school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn't happen again.
A boy who ran through a hay of bullets, thinking his mother was dead.
It was his first day in school (the Russians start school at the age of 7) and survived three days of captivity, hugging their mother, Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She told him to run.
Fearing that she was dead, he ran, and on the way he saw the baby crying, grabbing the baby by the hand, and ran through a hay of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said, "Damir told me his mom was dead.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara got out and was in the hospital with a wound on her legs, in turn thinking her son was dead.
After their reunion, she said, "I was crying out of joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now a non-existent News of the World), where he was rewarded as the Protector of Children from Barnardo's Premier Tony Blair and his wife Shery.
"This terror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can tell you, it's fading in my mind.
I remember right after I threw out all my toy gun.
But now I can play computer game with the shooting, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I was playing with in the courtyard who never got out.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy shop, where I was allowed to pick up whatever I wanted, and a car ride with an open horse.
But now he is fearful of places like Ukraine, where wars have led to the grief that he and his friends have endured.
This terror is coming back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry to all those who are suffering from these horrors," said Damir, who last week volunteered at a convent.
I'm so willing to help.
I want to be a cop someday, and I hope I'm enrolled in the Academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48 years old, said, "37 kids have been killed in our block, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence right after the takeover, just no kids screaming and running around, and this silence lasted for months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London wept when I told our story.
I realized then how people on the other side of the world can understand how we feel, how we can support.
She was grateful to "Sherey Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Cherie and just tell her it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat a borsche, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot at them with his water gun, and they ran off and played with him.
And it's only been a month after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so ready to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I still think this world hasn't been a better place in 10 years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of kids have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is a news report that they listen to when they're bored or when they're doing something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and quiet boy, he's neither aggressive nor evil.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not focused on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym every once in a while and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember he was lying on the sofa, turning his back on us for hours.
I didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him hurling all his weapons and other military toys, and Damir is 17 now, he's taller than me, pretty, smart, and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for hours I was so sure he was dead and I'd never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion, and I got up on my feet, I looked back, and I saw the hell around me, when the body parts were all over.
I was pretty sure it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember yelling at him, "Damir, run, run," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran.
So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
George Ilien, 17
A boy whose shocking post-capture picture was the key to the tragedy in Beslan.
Rest: Leaving Beslan George Ilyan with his mom Fatima after the takeover in 2004, and right George today
His blood-blooded face had a pattern of fear when he escaped death, when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarity in Beslan.
His 54-year-old mother, Fatima, the Chief Doctor, took him to school on her first day of school before taking his eldest son, Vladimir, to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the courtyard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of a nightmare," she remembered.
Not all alone, there was a family of our family, but all of them were killed.
Only my Georgia survived.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's no day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it's been yesterday, some of the scenes of these days all the time in front of me.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
The picture of Georgie (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember George so wanted to go to school that day, he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of crying Georgia in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but I also think that this picture makes people from all over the world feel our pain.
George now says, "It's important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused it?
This world goes to something very bad.
"I can't figure out how this is happening, 'cause if you ask people, no one wants to go to war, as it happens?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need to go through decades to forget her a little bit.
It has affected my health, and I still feel it.
I've been having nightmares for about three or four years because of the takeover, but now I'm getting better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym every September 1st.
I want to pay a tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to the University of Medicine in Vladikavkaz.
I'm gonna learn to be a cardio surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a military man, but I didn't get any health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
George Farniev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was at the feet of a murderer.
Improbable: George Farniev was at the feet of a murderer while he was invaded, but he was still able to survive.
During the takeover, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a killer bomber.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We think it was yesterday," said Georgie, who wanted to go to the FSB intelligence officer, but failed because of the damage to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that kids are easy to deal with bad things, I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the following year, it was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I passed out.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was in this famous picture.
Survivor: George Farniev today with a picture of himself at the hospital open on his laptop after the takeover.
My pain is immense, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
As far as my physical condition is concerned, I'm well.
I need to be careful with the knee that's been damaged, but now I'm walking well.
Still, my health didn't let me go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent out my files, including my medical records, and they said it was not possible.
My second thing was pets, so I went to veterinary.
I've been there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals from cats to cows.
He said, "I know I'll never tell my kids about my experience.
That's not what kids should know, and of course it's not what they're gonna get through.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when my anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies to mark it.
I know George won't go.
For him, it's got to be even stronger, 'cause he was there, and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God he came back to me.
He stays with us.
George's a grown-up now, but he's still having this nightmare.
It's hard to accept when something so terriblely unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had a number of surgeries, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he's 50 percent overwhelmed this nightmare, but you can't get over it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will stay with us.
A lot of friends and neighbors were killed during the takeover, and it only makes my pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and loved.
My son is with me, and it's the best gift God can give me, but my heart hurts for those who have been killed.
I know the families where the new kids were born, but I know the widows who never got married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart sprung out of my chest the moment I saw it in the hospital.
Now I'm looking at what's going on in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
War is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We've been one friendly country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure a lot of children have already been killed in Ukraine and a lot will be killed.
If we could grab all the rebels and get rid of them, as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A baby who was moved to a safe place by a SWAT fighter.
Saved: Alena Zkaewu is being taken to a safe place by a Russian Special Forces (left).
Now she's ten (right), and she doesn't remember a monstrous crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when a small Alena was hand-held by a Russian policeman from a captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, her ten-year-old sister, Christina, and her brother Mahar in the school gym.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was spared, but Alenina's mother and sister died in a deadly slaughter.
Her father, Ruslan, has been remarried since then, and he and his new wife, Svetlana, have a little daughter, who he called Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alona, who is now ten, remembers nothing about the takeover and blooms into a smart and cheerful girl, say the neighbors.
"They're a big happy family now, and Alona and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great dad, and he wants to keep them out of all memory when he's celebrating his tenth anniversary.
You can see why.
Semi-defendant Sindzi Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund "Borossia", said he was looking forward to re-entering the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyous career event.
Of course, I'm very glad to play for "Borussia" again, - quotes the Bild words of Kagawa.
I feel so good.
It's full of positive emotions, and I'm looking forward to getting back on the field in the form of "Borussia."
Remember, Kagawa moved to the MU from "Brussia" in the summer of 2012 for 16 million Euros.
But he was never able to join the English club, spending only 38 matches in two seasons in the England Cup, punching six balls and giving eight performances.
A man is charged with attacking a girl at the Pelican Walking Cross in Fife.
A 78-year-old man will be tried on the charge of attacking a 3-year-old girl at the Pelican Walking Cross in Fife.
Gordon Stuart allegedly hit a girl at the Pittenwin Pass in East Newk.
The prosecutors said that Mr. Stuart was running his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and hit the girl, causing her injury.
Stuart, 78, from Anstruter, denied his guilt in the Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the royal attorney, has set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel, and Holland won't stay in Vladivostok.
A duty-free shop at Vladivostok Airport put up a sign prohibiting a number of world political leaders from shopping in the shop.
No perfume, no wodka, no cognac.
The department of the shop decided that US President Barack Obama, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President François Hollande, Vitaly Clique, Julia Tymoshenko, Japan's prime minister, and a few other well-known companions would not be able to win vodka, cognac, and perfume in their shop.
And put an appropriate sign on the door.
Previously, Obama was not allowed to enter an even less accessible facility, the MGU Dietary Cafeteria, as reported by the General Service.
Whether the American president ever wanted to eat in a dietary canteen in Russia is unknown, but the banners seem to be very clever.
Is there any cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to the agraries
The Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, believes that under the embargo, the Russian agriers should learn new technologies in order to produce the customized cheese.
The Board was given during a visit to the Agrocomplex company by the South Pacific Company.
The head of government also advised the rectors to redirect to Russian meat, the quality of which is at an appropriate level.
The annual food import embargo has been in place in Russia since 7 August.
Valentine Maslakov, the head of the Russian team, is content with the results of the DecaNation.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result, given the lack of focused training for the competition.
Our athletes have been at their own level, saying "All sports" to Maslakov.
Third place is confirmation of our high command level.
It's nice to see the French, and even Americans, have a minimal advantage over us.
We have to bear in mind that we haven't been ready for this competition.
The season was over, and we didn't commit our leaders to the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we've been second at this tournament, but this season, we've been re-engineered.
The French, on the other hand, set up a capable team of 13 European champions.
They have not concealed their intention to win this year, as they have publicly declared on many occasions.
But even such a composition of the hosts of the competition was not able to stand up to the Americans.
So I think the Russians have come to such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were in order below the same Brilliant League.
Season over.
Of course, sports don't matter much more, much less in team-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And as a result, I agree, it's absurd when at 1500 meters, men are so into the tactical stratagems of the race, that they show the result below the average... of the feminine race.
4 hints to improve the quality of underwater images and videos
If you want to take a picture or make a video underwater, you have a number of options.
The cheapest option is a watertight soap, such as Nicon Colpix AW120, or an action cell, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures at the family holiday with a few cameras, all at a cost of about $350.
No matter what kind of equipment you use, there are a few rules that need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Recheck your equipment.
Even if you have a watertight cell, make sure the cell battery and other compartments are closed tightly.
Also, set up your camera for the type of picture or video you're going to be filming.
Some photo and video cams have camera or object-type modes that optimize the display for underwater conditions.
And before you jump in the water, figure out how deep your equipment can sink.
Some of the cells are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our buyer's guidance and digital-cam ratings for both conventional and watertight models.
Take a few shots, because a lot of them won't.
The miners have a VCD that will help you pack up the images, while the action cams don't usually have them.
Even if you have LCD, it's gonna be hard to see underwater, and the frame design will be a random process.
So do a few frames.
Also, if your camera has a series mode that takes off a number of frames with a bit of different display settings, use it.
Stay at the surface.
The number of light drops significantly, the deeper you dive under the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you are filming in a pool, a river, or an ocean.
This will also enable you to pass more colors on the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Draw closer to the objects.
It's a good tip for a land-based picture, but it's even more important underwater due to dark light conditions.
Most importantly, if you're filming an action camera, this equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you're gonna have to get close to the object of the shot if you want to fill out the frame.
Bilal Mahov's 2012 Freewill Olympics Bronze Priest can go to the Greek-Roman struggle.
This was reported by Sazeed Sajid, the main coach of the Dagestan team for the free fight.
He did not rule out the participation of a sportsman in the World Cup in Tashkent in September 2014.
Billal Mahov is currently at the "Classic" team, and he quotes "R-Sport" by Sajid Sajidov.
In fact, Billal was also in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth First, he was the winner of the freelance tournament and the third prizer in the Greek-Roman competition and decided to focus on the free fight.
It's been a long time since we've been talking about a new phase of our career, our heavyweight going to be in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'll tell you more, Mahov can go to the world championship in Tashkent - if he wins the outfit.
But the final word is always for a trainer's staff led by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of man whose identity might shake things up, even in a gigantic organization like the National Health Service.
He was an anesthesiologist, who dedicated his career to freeing the sick from the pain of the disease as well as from the pain of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalled, was an MI-6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson realized that while the doctors are interested in diagnosis and disease, those who are being treated are mostly concerned about something very different -- pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength in myself.
In his struggle with symptoms like the flu, he found that he resented his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to go faster, not later," he remarked.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson found out he was unusual and unexplained why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a co-worker to get a chest X-ray.
Only two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The X-ray results are back.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the plevre, or lung cover.
For most of the cancers, it's hard to figure out the exact cause.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all people with lung cancer have smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the reason is contact with asbest, fibrous building material, which was once called a "wrath," but which is now known to be fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that you can ignore.
Asbestos, after all, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the United Kingdom since the 1960s, when the industrial recommendation ban entered into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked in close contact with it: pipe insulation, construction, carpentry, and docks, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it hardly seems to be a cause for concern today.
But this peace of mind is wrong.
Britain is now at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic.
More people die from mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
At an annual death rate of about 2,500, more than twice as many people die of the disease as from car accidents.
Annual mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are experiencing its fatal effects now is that, while the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually prohibited by law in 1999), mesothelioma tends to take decades to develop.
And the attack on mesotheliomas is not limited to veterans in industrial engineering.
Asbest was, and in many cases stays, in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we go to school, and the shops we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma ignores class, level of wealth, profession, or age.
The Bastions of Choice, from the fashionable London superstitions to private schools, have not been saved.
The House of Parliament is infested with asbest.
Even the hospitals that are meant to treat us have been the reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a trumpet insulation.
In fact, he had to think about where he might have been in contact with the asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It seems that there might have been a lot of asbest in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years interning," he wrote.
All the students, the nurses, the doctors, and the transporters used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
It was a question he, unfortunately, could give a partial answer to.
"Of the four doctors who have been interned at the Gaia Hospital and who have subsequently developed a mesothelioma in the last five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I'm the one who survived."
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with a mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
It's not like it's been so long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die eight months after the diagnosis.
She's always fatal.
So now we can just repeat the question of Lawson, "How many of us are going to get the same disease?"
According to Professor Julian Pito, a leading mesothelioma expert in the United Kingdom, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when an asbestic epidemic in the United Kingdom is expected to overwhelm itself, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people don't think they're gonna die like this right now.
Asbest Mine in Québec, Canada
A quick look at the records from the court halls, where the victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma’s attack has spread.
In this June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to having been misinspected by Janice Ellen in contact with asbestos.
She worked on the Internet for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, running a dress section at two sites, one of which was a major shop in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she began working for M&S.
Now she has two children over the age of 20.
"Before it happened," she said, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbest.
I didn't think it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbest.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They have their name from the word "asbestiform", which means a fibrous structure that informs them of strength and flexibility.
Of the six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roofs, floor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler sutures, even in car brake pads.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage”, which can result in death.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crokidolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbest, and experts suggest that “there are strong, though circumstantial, reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of mesothelioma patients [in the United Kingdom]”.
Marks & Spencer has been exposed to asbest at the company's main shop on Oxford Street, London Alamy
Janice Ellen may not have thought of himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Pito suggests that her history is far from unusual.
He carried out a study of the sick, which suggests that “a significant percentage of mesotheli, when there is no known exposure to work or home, is likely to be due to the exposure of the environment to asbestos”.
Most of this, he says, is due to the "normal use and impact of the weather" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddad Consulting report, which addressed the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even at the very center of the government, may have been unwittingly exposed.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical mines and pipelines behind the parliamentary committee spaces had been contaminated with ash, the fatal fibers of which could be driven by something as harmless as “severe air streams”.
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case the opposite seems to be true.
Although the Office of the Chief Executive of the Parliament insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a “pure health certificate”, it now recognized that it was necessary to work on £1 billion to renovate the Parliament by improving the electricity and removing the asbestos, and that, after the 2015 general election, members of Parliament might meet at the QE2 conference centre near, rather than at the Westminster green berries.
The Goddard report noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed in accordance with the different rules”.
It is not possible to know if this mismanagement error will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who have never been able to locate their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, he's suspected of being exposed to asbest when he was working in the hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that was successfully sued for asbest," he said, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places where I worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45 years old, and he was in the middle of the operation late tonight.
All of a sudden, I started to get sick.
It started very fast.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain was coming out of a pleura, a shell around the lungs.
But like Janice Ellen, he just didn't have a reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
After all, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Surprisingly, the doctors took x-rays of the chest and put in pleural catheters to get the liquid out of the lungs and send it to the test.
Still, his condition was undiagnosed.
Gradually, his health improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms came back, often after he was doing sports and breathing hard.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients went to his room with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with a mesothelioma.
But even then Abbott didn't link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was tens of years older and worked directly with the asbestos.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and the doctor who consulted him showed his C.T. results and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera-enabled sensor was introduced into the cavity between the casing of his chest and the casing of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just go on," he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year's, "I've been told it's a mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosed by mesothelioma
All of a sudden, Abbott went to see the Macmillan nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the magnitude of the epidemic.
"Asbestos appears to have been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where there was often asbestos insulation on pipes," he said.
People who have been exposed to asbest in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
So the mesothelioma is now affecting the younger people of atypical professions.
The most dangerous insulated pipes in the hospitals were in the basements, so it is unlikely that the patients would be affected.
But many of the staff who went through the pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the dining halls (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to a toxic substance.
For a few decades after the war, it turns out that the hospitals were a place where, in theory, they saved the lives of the people, but a place that was a threat to the life of the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
Schoolmates set up their Bunsen burners on asbestos pads.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and city halls because of its remarkable insulation and fire-resistance features.
Schools, too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos for the first time in a class.
All over the country, in countless chemistry classes, schoolmates placed their Bunsen burners on asbestos pads.
Websites have emerged to address the problem of asbestos in schools.
In the meantime, in our homes, harmless things, such as floor tiles or roofs of barns, tend to contain asbest.
"It's an industrial venom that's in a lot of our constructions," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in a case against the Gaius Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden barn in the 1970s.
So watch out for the garden sheds.
The effect of diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a lot of time to get to know this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to go on, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to go out and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not gonna see Christmas again.
One of the hardest things was to move from a doctor to a patient.
As countless patients before him, he remembers how confused he was with the volume of information he needed to receive.
"It was hard to understand," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I've been given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not gonna see Christmas again.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, because it is the mechanic of how we support life - the very act of breath - that causes the cancer that kills.
Most of the mesotheliomas are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When the asbestos breaks down and the fibers inhale, it can be stuck in a pleura, a pulmonary shell.
Asbestos fibers irritate the plevre and can cause cell mutation.
"The problem is the inhalation of needles of asbest fibers," by Professor Tom Treger, cardiothoracic surgeon, who went to Gaia Hospital in 2001.
It's the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbest, ironically, now leading a mesothelioma treatment center.
The apprentice knew Lawson and treated some of the others who might have been exposed to internment at the hospital.
When the needles of the asbestos fall into the tissue of the lungs, he says, "by breathing it out into the periphery where the shell is located.
This is, in essence, an invasive process from the start.
Normal treatment options for other forms of cancer are far less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is a cause of heated controversy.
Some people think it's worth a try.
The apparel doesn't agree.
"I can't cut out the plevre," he said.
You can't get around her with a knife.
In the meantime, this cancer is "not very good at chemo," which is "acting," but not curing.
"Sometimes there are sick people who live long," says Treger.
But in the end, they all die.
Luckily, some patients live a lot, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen J. Gould died 20 years after he was diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After he was sick of mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis, was single-handedly turned into a support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Hello, Rocky Central," he used to say cheerfully when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very active.
First, Abbott was offered six rounds of chemo therapy, which would take four months to extend his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "screwed to make things a bit more positive."
After meeting with a number of experts, Abbott decided to continue the treatment with Professor Loick Lange-Lazdunski, a Professor of Thoral Surgery at Gaia Hospital.
"We had the advantage of not needing a direction, I just called 'em, and they accepted me," Graham admits.
The average patient would have to receive a referral and approval for funding.
Money is critical for mesothelioma patients to receive the best available treatment.
But when such treatment is at last inefficient, many patients face another financial cause for concern - about the future of the families they will leave.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what's changed in the 1960s is that it's become clear that even very small quantities could be at risk.
That's when the company's bad faith was talked about.
Andrew Lawson and Gaius Hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a "full-value settlement", according to Morgan, because Lawson could not prove clearly that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with the asbest in the Gaia Hospital.
After an investigation of his death, the representative of the Gaius Hospital still confirmed that “the bess in the basements in question was removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, tying a fatal contact with asbest to one company or place of work - usually tens of years later - has proved to be a major problem for mesothelioma patients.
Many of their former employers have replaced the owner or closed down.
Insurance records may have been lost.
And those who defend themselves from lawsuits know that they have no time on their side, of course.
In response, a number of new legislation has emerged this year to make it easier for mesothelioma patients to recover compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under the Act, a £350 million fund, funded by the insurance industry, was set up for those who have been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact, but who have no one to sue.
In such cases, the sick will receive 80 per cent of the sum that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case, about £1200.
Some 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, as many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350 million is a very good job for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal written by the insurers for the insurers," he says, insinuating that the sum is a quarter of what the insurers would have to pay if they hadn't interfered with the time period and the Mesothelioma patients would have been able to track down the companies and file a claim in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, the former Minister of Labor and Pensions, admitted that the law was "improved."
But both Penning and Morgan admit that while seven people die every day, quick action was needed.
"People are suffering so much, and they need help today," said Penning in the second reading of the Bill of Mesothelioma last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lange-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considered effective.
This was followed by radio and chemotherapy, a tri-therapy in which Lange-Lazdunski can brag 40% of the survivors in five years.
Abbott sensed a surge of energy.
"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's some kind of force that supports you.
When you give up, things can get worse very fast.
Graham Abbott went to surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
The next scans didn't show any sign of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots in my chest.
I was about to turn 50.
It's not a life-threatening thing.
It's the end of life.
And again Abbott went through six cycles of chemo.
Now there's no sign of tumors.
But the process is both physical and emotional.
You can think about the practical things -- the finances when I die, for example, or about showing my wife how a timer works on a boiler.
When you get bad news, you get sad.
We have to look forward.
As Ally's dad, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
The first time I was diagnosed, I told the girls I had a disease, which means I'm not gonna live to be old.
They reacted in a very different way.
Tamsin's very social and vigourous.
She told all her friends, and a lot of people called us very quickly.
Ally was more tempered.
She didn't talk much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for mesothelioma patients, such discussions do not match the hope, even the simplicity of the chance to survive.
This disease carries with it (even in the end for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "the mesothelioma is not a threat to life.
The bodies of embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen the pot and to increase the resistance to heat.
Pliny the Senior describes asbestos.
Now there's a painting that doesn't ignite.
I've seen it make napkins smoldering in fireplaces on banquets.
The modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and tissues.
Large asbestos mines are being opened in Canada and South Africa, and soon thereafter in America, Italy, and Russia.
It's the perfect thermal insulation for steam engines and the Industrial Revolution turbines.
Global production of asbestos is increasing to over 30,000 tons per year.
Predential statists identify premature mortality among those who work with asbest and who are thus denied life insurance.
Nelly Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke states that the particles of asbest in her lungs "were, of course, the main cause of death."
This is the first case of this type.
Kershaw's employers, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not accept responsibility.
No compensation.
During the Second World War, ship-building is an intensive development, one of the most deadly professions in terms of exposure to asbestos.
Voluntary Industrial Ban on Imports of Blue Asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful health action for exposure to asbestos in the United Kingdom.
Global asbestos production has grown to more than 4,213,000 tons per year.
Britain imports 139,000 tons.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety in the United Kingdom requires that all contractors working with asbestos be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is illegal in the United Kingdom.
All use of asbest is illegal in the United Kingdom.
The Mesothelioma Act was passed in the United Kingdom.
A compensation scheme of £350 million has been declared.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in low-cost building materials in many parts of the world.
World production is at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters swear to avenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to stand for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to start a long-awaited protest in the Hong Kong business quarter, as the activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the statement.
The decision of the All-China People ' s Congress in fact allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't fool our expectations, but it still angered us," said the lawmaker Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They tricked Hong Kong's men.
And it's obvious we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China's decision, Lee Faye, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that it would be too “hootic” to allow the popular nomination of Hong Kong's leader for election.
Since 1997, when the British handed over control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to let the people of the region vote for the head of government since 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the Sunday decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives the Hong Kongs the right to a direct vote; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of the Peking Commission for the selection of candidates.
And according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision was made after the summer, when one of the largest and most public protests in Hong Kong took place over the years.
Behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to shut down Hong Kong's financial area if Beijing does not guarantee a true universal right to vote.
On Sunday evening, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers stated that their movement was moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise in the waves of protest in the weeks to come.
They did not, however, give details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “thinked the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can be taken only if all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other option.
It is with great regret that we report that, to date, every opportunity for dialogue has been exhausted and that the seizure of the central region will certainly take place.
Government authorities in Hong Kong had been preparing for Beijing ' s statement for a few days, and security measures at Government headquarters had been strengthened on Sunday, with the involvement of the police and the barricade.
Many in Hong Kong feel that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
Inflows from the mainland increase competition in goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and free speech, are beginning to weaken under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize Occupy Central, saying that its demonstrations put Hong Kong’s business life force at risk.
"The protest they're talking about can result in a lot of economic damage, depending on how long and how long people will be involved," said the lawgiver Regina Ip, who has been critical of the movement for a long time.
We do not want the concern that Hong Kong is getting out of hand.
It's an image that's bad for investment.
Chinese public media has also been reporting in recent days, in which Hong Kong’s democratic activists have been shown by subversives sent by Western powers.
This summer, the activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
And in July, tens of thousands went to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
American prom culture goes to university life: first-year students are invited to come on a private jet.
We are happy to respond to such a demand by launching the UK's first lux-travel service for current students.
To give a bright impression of coming to the university, the company also offers transport options such as a private jet, a Rolls-Royce Phantom, an Aston Martin or a McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also stated that the service was thinking about safety.
This service is the ideal alternative for students who usually have to move their stuff all over the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new options for the VIF, we look forward to helping students this year to get to the university with the best of effort and the best of luxuries.
The representative of the company stated that, as the service was just running, the order had not yet been received, but added that “the student will start ordering the service in the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that, despite the fact that the student needs to pay £90,000 a year, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
The current student is quite different from the student 10, 20, 30, or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: more important than ever to make an excellent first impression, and the VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Student Union has criticized this service as being detached from reality.
Megan Dunn, the NSS Vice-President for Higher Education, said, "This project seems incredibly detached from the lives of most of the students.
Many of the students who are going to go to university this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis, when available financial support in the form of loans and grants has not been able to keep up with the fast-growing spending on basic needs, before they can even begin to think about taking out thousands of pounds on something like a simple entry to a dormitory.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police behaviour after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come up raise their hands and say, "Hands up, don't shoot" while they're waiting in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protest in Ferguson, Missouri, in connection with the murder of an unarmed teenager, Michael Brown, Blogger Miriam Zoila Perez observed a change in the Internet chat among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who had left comments put the gender above race when it came to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as the tension in the Middle West grew and national attention was drawn, Perez saw the responses of white women, who focused 100 per cent on race.
Compared to the response of black women shortly after the 9 August murder, a personal essay with such headlines as “the thought of Ferguson on behalf of a white woman” and “Femenyism is not just about oppressing women” appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they have shown a significant change.
"In feminism, I don't think there are a lot of people talking about the white color of the skin and the privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic for the crisis we're facing, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so racially related, they felt they needed to point it out.
For an English-language professor at the University of Ohio, Mitchell Ferguson exposed the problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as “female problems” in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's happening to me and my partner, and get 150 liquor from all over," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how colored people are being attacked in their own country, silence is overwhelmed.
"Why is it safe for women to talk in public about relationships, but not about public safety?", she asks.
For black women, like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly share those problems; they faced a complex reality every day.
While white women now unite race and gender in feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Till 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and this was almost always based on the rape of a white woman," Hattery told us.
Needed a white woman to back up the story to justify the lynching.
From Hatteri's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white surrogates, such as Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation in the late 1800s and found that the struggle for the right to vote would be effective for one group alone: women or blacks.
"They've decided to put all the eggs in a basket of women's right to vote, and the blacks' right to vote was due to appear later," told Hattery.
Looking back at such things gives us a clear picture of why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We've never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took 10 years for white women to unite against the lynchings of the Southern Women ' s Association for the Prevention of Litigation.
This group came up almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, said Mitchell.
From Mitchell's point of view, the rise in the response of white feminist women to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminist women had to deal with the problems that black women had to deal with in several generations.
"Really, it would be great if the activists who have such [conventional feminist] ideology would take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to contraception?", asked Mitchell.
The second-wave feminists, who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to see what this means.
A well-known white feminist activist, Gloria Steinem, used Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown's murder, and published a sharp article by a columnist, Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans take a more active part in the racist protest.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger of the body - and the view of the racial problems that are very different in the public polls - will be at the top of the change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem is vouching for a more intertwined feminism, which includes both race and gender, her comments on race in America are still surprising to some.
Researcher Christina Sommers of the American Business Institute, author of "Who Stolen Feminism?", told She The People, that young men in the United States, especially colored young men, are "more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remark about Ferguson contradicts her earlier criticism.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but very little for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, "The Watcher of My Brother" to help the vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking young men, a bitter reaction from many feminist women, including Gloria Steinem, followed.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem that promotes the frontline of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested some 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the south-west border of the country this year, immigration reform has resurfaced – this time as a problem of women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present the problem as important to women, she just needed to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of workers are granted [men's immigrant] visas, women who come with them find themselves in a position that is vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are resonant with women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich pig house is for sale.
The picture of a house on sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out to be a big pig resting in the living room.
It is sold for £12000, a separate home with a single bedroom on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was a picture of the living room of the house - a picture of a pig with a head resting on the couch.
The Real Estate Agency, Connells, reported that the pig in the picture was the homeowner's pet.
“At the same time, the picture was misplaced and has already been deleted,” the company's representative reported.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique separate home with one bedroom."
Despite the fact that the agency has removed the picture from its website, it is still in advertising.
The sale of the house generated interest in social media, where some asked if the pig was sold with the house.
The Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the fourth round of the US Open game, Caroline Wozniatsky, is of the view that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to complete the year with dignity and try to get to a new level, handing out Basili OSYPOV from New York.
How do you generally rate your results at the Big Helmet tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad I won the Roland Garros.
As for the other three, I was not stable, especially at the end of some matches.
Now I'm, of course, upset.
I couldn't even get to the quarterfinals.
What challenges do you have before the end of the season?
After an offended defeat, I have a huge motive to get to a new level.
I have a lot to work on, and I'm gonna do my best to make it a good year.
The Asian series of tournaments has begun in a couple of weeks.
Member of the State Committee on Physical Culture, Sport and Youth, former World Champion Nikolai Valuev, has offered to give GTO bonuses on entry.
He said that, in general, the norm would be the same as in Soviet time, that people would pass the norm by pull, run, and other exercises.
Let us recall that the 12 constituents of Russia will begin to implement GTO standards on their territory on 1 September.
I also invited the schoolmates who had passed the TOC to give the bonuses on their entry to the university, lamented Valuev.
For example, you can add a little bit to the EEG.
There are also proposals to give an extra off-the-job for the employees who have passed the sports test.
There's a new millionaire in the city of Harvey in South Wales after winning the lottery.
Player at the Harvey lottery this month.
There's a search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth, where one lucky guy will take home almost $1.1 million from a lottery game on Saturday night.
The newsstand in Harvey brings gold to the grand prize for the second time in five years, and the last win was $1 million in November 2009.
But a successful victor still has to make a statement.
The owner of the shop, Steve Forward, said that the win was a big deal in a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone's very excited.
We thought it might be a secret win.
The eight Western Australian winners celebrated the win-wins last month, marking the end of a few successful weeks for state players.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, following a massive $7.5 million win from Belmont just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple has been playing for 20 years and has reported that the win has given them an opportunity to travel around the world to buy a new home.
A millionaire from Harvey brings the number of winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.

This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will bring to the Government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, and the Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry, Oleg Pluijnikov, has presented a round table, which was held on the Moscow Motor Show in 2014.
The plan has been commissioned by the Government, and one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted at the end of September - early in October, says Plownikov, the proposed measures deal with electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of gas-fuelled vehicles in Russia is already in place.
The plan (with a copy of the report) is designed for 2014-2017.
Criteria for the assessment of electric and hybrid transport are to be developed and how to stimulate the use and production of clean vehicles.
A report to the Government setting out the tax and customs support measures for electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; a soft credit and soft lease scheme will be available by April 2015; and proposals for lowering car prices, encouraging localization and building a service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
Regulatory changes are to be made in 2014 - 2015 to facilitate the construction of the charger infrastructure (parking, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials will, in the course of 2015, make proposals to regional authorities to also encourage the use of clean transport - in the form of an advantage in traffic and parking, for example, and by February 2016 - and to expand public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Department of Economic and Social Affairs will include in the list of performance indicators for regional authorities criteria that reflect the effectiveness of support for the production of clean transport and for the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric vehicles in Russia is still in the form of some 100 electric vehicles sold in the country as a whole in 2013.
In early 2014, an import levy on electric vehicles was lifted, so sales would be about 500 grand, foretells the Chief Executive Director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrei Pankow.
But the five-fold growth does not make the electric car any more visible: in 2013 in Russia, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million light and light commercial cars were sold.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors is imported into Russia.
Renault is preparing to start the import, the company's focus is on corporate clients, says Renault's Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships in Russia, Nicolas Remiz.
Most of the other manufacturers of electric transport have taken a stand-by position with regard to Russia.
The development of electric vehicles is also available to Russian manufacturers - "," GAZ, "but the output is minimal.
For example, in January and July 2014, ASM Holding reported that Autowaz had released 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low due to the high cost of electric vehicles, admits the Director of Autowaza for Engineering Sergei Amanyov, without the control of a break in this segment...
The development of the Russian market for electric vehicles, in addition to the expensive machinery (those motors that are sold in Russia, on average twice as much as the equivalents of internal combustion engines) hinders the inexperience of the charging infrastructure (tanks - units), and sighs at the CEO of the Autostat, Sergey Celkov.
Due to the high cost and slow rate of the reduction in the cost of electric vehicles in the next three to four years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, foretells Mikhail Podorozhanski, editor-in-chief, who agrees with it.
Automotive manufacturers, on the other hand, say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the normal cost.
The Russian market for electric vehicles has good prospects, and the main thing is to build confidence in consumers that “electronicity” is real; this will be facilitated, in particular, by the emergence of new charging stations, by the President of the BMW group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimma.
Such infrastructural projects are being carried out by, for example, Rosseti State Company: a number of stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon be available.
Negotiations are also under way with other regions for the construction of a gas network.
According to the director of Rossete, Vladimir Sofyin, the company believes in the market for electric vehicles and is ready to build gas stations all over the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country, and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of different brands.
In addition, Rosseti, as a network company, has no right to sell electricity, and an opportunity is being explored to do so with regard to the charging of electric vehicles.
Punkov considers the most effective measure to control the formation of a market for electric vehicles in Russia to be the lifting of customs duties.
The zero rate will be in effect until the end of 2014, and the possibility of an extension, an extension of the grace list, is being considered.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environment (the idea is discussed and all the machines are involved) will also support the market, but not as strong as the customs preferences, Pankow thinks.
The transport tax in Russia is low, says Pankow, unlike, for example, Norway, where the fall in the tax has led to a sharp increase in the sales of electric vehicles, now accounting for 12% of the market.
Russia also needs incentives for motorowners, such as free parking in the city centre (as already done in Moscow), I'm sure Pankows, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles along the marked lanes, which Russia has not yet.
A private jet crashed in Colorado.
Piper PA-46 crashed in Colorado, U.S. state.
Three of the five people in it have been killed, handing over ITAR-TASS.
The survivors have been taken to the hospital.
The accident took place a few kilometres from the Denver airstrip.
The causes of the tragedy are now being identified.
In Donetsk oblast, they deal with the Donbass Battalion's captured militants.
The punishers were surrounded by Ilowaysk.
They were loyal to their own commanders, and dozens of silos died under fire.
The survivors say that if they knew what the real situation in south-eastern Ukraine was, they would not go to war.
One hundred and eight prisoners are lucky.
The Donbass Battalion's punishers survived the "meat chopper" in which they fell under Iloway.
In the army of the Donetsk People ' s Republic, the militants spent a few days, in fact abandoned by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When the headquarters reported that the ring could be removed from the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But just a couple of minutes later, there were bullets and bullets hanging from all sides.
"On the basis of the information I was given, we had a hallway, and we were allowed to go out," he says, "and so does the Deputy Battalion Commander, who has a call for "Lermontov."
And when we went down to the bottom between multipole and Rednosel, there was a cross-fire with anti-tank controlled missiles, with "threats", 30-millimeter grenade launchers, BMD automatic guns, small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three cars in the back, and there were only two of them left.
"Lermontov" states: almost immediately, at least 60 people were killed, dozens were injured, and many died later.
The survivors are now being treated by the people they come to kill.
Now the prisoners are amazed that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give them food, medicine.
While their own commanders defrauded them and condemned them to the right death.
We've just been betrayed, they say.
The column, the entire battalion to be destroyed.
To the Donbass Battalion, like many of his companions, Alexei volunteered, for the Ukrainian news was talking about the atrocities allegedly committed in the south-east by the separatists.
This is where Alexei saw a very different picture.
His mother was killed in Lugansk, not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that there was a mortar attack going on, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces, "one of the soldiers, Alexei, told me.
I wanted to leave the Battalion after that.
We didn't get out of Ilowaysk, they said we were in a ring.
I've already made a deal with the commander, and the report has already been sent out.
We were taken to Ilowaysk from the pickup with Zurahov.
According to the prisoners, there's a 300-350 man trapped in a "cot" under Iloway.
Now, some survivors have admitted that if the time could be reversed, they would never have joined the retaliatory battalion.
All the prisoners were handed over by the militia to the DNR forces.
Everyone's gonna get checked out for war crimes.
The region has a food price-limiting headquarters.
A headquarters has been set up in Krasnoyar province to limit the price of products in the region if necessary.
The decree on the establishment of this structure has already been signed.
Members of the Government of the province, representatives of the Executive and the supervisory agencies have been part of the headquarters.
All together, they're going to be watching the prices of the country's agricultural products.
– Will Kyiv make up for $140 million in losses to Rosnefti?
The head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, stated that the company estimated the damage from the shelling of the Lisican NPP in Ukraine in the amount of $140 million.
He spoke about it in an interview with Spider.
"We estimate the cost of $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government for the payment of compensation," said Sechin.
According to him, the renovated Lisican NPP was planned for commissioning in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There was no fighting, there was no "exploited rebels," but the Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial site.
In addition, the technological oil in the pipes was missing," he said.
Recall, on 18 July, in connection with the bombardment of the Lisican NPP, the oil storage tank was burned down and the buildings of the two warehouses were destroyed.
The Lisican NPP, the main oil refinery in Ukraine, was launched in October 1976.
The total capacity of the LSN is about 7 million tons of oil per year.
The plant is able to release fuel from the Euro-4 standard, as well as the Euro-5 diztonium batches.
In March 2012, the oil supply to the Lisican NPP was suspended due to its loss.
At the plant, it was decided to start the repairs.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisican NPP, together with other Ukrainian assets of TNC-XB.
The Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea launched a short-range projectile in the direction of the Japanese Sea.
According to South Korean media, this was about 10:30 a.m. local time from the province of Chagando, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
As Interfax was told in the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff, it is believed that the missile fell into the Japanese Sea after flying about 220 km.
The ruble falls in a context of geo-political pressure
On the Moscow Exchange, the dollar rose at the opening by 3 cop to 37.15 roubles, down to a boolean basket against a background of geo-political tension.
ETS bids for a dollar began with transactions at 37.11-37.2 roubles/$1 in an average of 37.16 roubles/$1 in two minutes, which is 4 cops above the previous closure.

The Russian market continued to fall rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but there was no panic this time.
He continued to be cheaper and rouble, and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Investors are now pre-empting the deterioration of the geo-political environment and possible new sanctions against Russia.
But so far, it's more like an artificial hysteria, spiked through the media, especially the Westerns.
There are not many options for new sanctions against the Russian Federation.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to be severely weakened against the scaffolding basket.
The geopolitic background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, the Russian indexes and the national currency can be adjusted.
Orenburg Airlines will be suing Ideal Tour
Orenburg Airlines brought a total of 4.7 billion roubles to Ideal Tour.
There are two cases on which the meetings will be held in October.
There will be different judges to try the cases.
According to Interfax, the first claim was filed on 14 August.
It's a little over 425 million roubles.
The meeting is scheduled for 7 October.
The second application was filed on 18 August.
It's 4.24 billion roubles.
The meeting is scheduled for 2 October.
Journalists in the Russian Union of the Touring Industry have been told that there are different judges.
In July, there was information in the media on the debts of Ideal-Tour to Orenburg Airlines in the amount of 1.5 billion roubles.
The CEO of the airline, Victor Zukin, is talking about a sum of 1.6 billion roubles.
The CEO of the Aeroflot, Vitaly Savelyev, calls an even larger sum, two billion roubles.
Twitter has tried to be more interesting to new users
The Twitter microblogs tool has changed the user registration process to involve new players more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have left their microblogs.
The new Twitter users will now view a large number of re-advised accounts during the login to make up their own reading circles.
The recommendations are drawn up on the basis of the interests indicated in the registration.
With this, Twitter automatically ticks the subscription for all automatically selected accounts.
That's why the user will have to take the ticks himself so he won't be able to read those he's not interested in.
While users of the microblogs service used to see only the avatars of the recommended users, Twitter now produces a model of one of the blogger's popular tweets to help impress a man.
This is the largest change in Twitter registration in the last three years.
Twitter has been active in modernizing the service recently.
This activity is related, above all, to the continued efforts of the service to achieve cost-neutrality.
In 2014, the microblog service experienced a slower growth in the user base and a drop in reader activity.
The company is now desperately in need of more consumer loyalties, which would have been left behind for a long time.
It is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising.

Automotive recycling programme resumed on 1 September
Since 1 September, Russia has been re-launching a car-recycling programme.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion roubles will be available for this purpose.
As explained by the Head of the Ministry of Promigration of the Russian Federation, Denis Manturov, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation through the reallocation of support from other areas.
The programme will address all vehicles over the age of six.
The amount of compensation will range from 40,000 per car to 350,000 roubles per truck.
Previously, Russia had a similar car-recycling program.
The main difference in the current project, the Minister explained, is that not only is it expected to use the machines to get a discount, but it is also possible, if the car is over six years old, to buy a new one with a discount on the old one at the Treid in the dealer's hand-off to Interfax.
More than 16 billion roubles were spent on the previous federal disposal program, which was in place from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
As a result, the production of passenger cars in 2010 was about 1.2 million (a plus 101.4 per cent as compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game on modern journalism
The game designer Nicky Keyes, a well-known coming out-Simulator, decided to release a game on modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
The Keyes began work on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact is now very well known.
The source of inspiration for the game was the events in Ferguson, where protests are under way, which began after a policeman killed an unarmed black boy.
The focus of the project, which has no name yet, will be the way in which the narratives of the stories have an impact on their impact.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will need to take a picture of what's going on in the areas where the police and the public are fighting.
A hero can take a different picture of what's going on, which will have an impact on the course of events.
If he pulls off the scene so that the police look like heroes and the protesters look like bandits, the police will be more likely to treat him and let him go where a normal man can't go.
If he's going to cover things differently, his pictures can turn peaceful protest into a massive uprising.
The points in the game will need to be Twitterd by the hero, where new subscribers will appear, if the photos in the game prove to be popular.
The game has no name yet.
The date of entry and the platform on which it will appear is unknown.
The case, however, has published an image showing how an event can change depending on how a picture of it has been taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Keyes, he explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but he wanted to focus it on events in the Gaza Strip, not protesting in the United States.
After he began to collect material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
But when he saw the media report on events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on what had happened.
Nicky Keyes is an independent developer who publishes browser games.
His best-known project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which describes the events in Keyes' own biography, is about how a bisexual teenager is trying to tell homophobic parents about his relationship.
Heleteus is dragging Ukraine into the bloodbath
The Minister of Defence of Ukraine, Valery Geletey, has been called upon to prepare for the next “tens of thousands” of victims, and has drawn the people into a bloodthirsty confrontation, as stated in the report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
“In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the remarks made by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valery Geletheus, who declared “the completion of an operation to free Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the “Great National War”, in which the losses would be numbered“tens of thousands”.
The level of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who has published the post on his Facebook page - a subject for the study of non-military specialists - is described in a report by Russian diplomats.
They hardly believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: "The Russian side has already threatened, through informal channels, that if resistance continued, they would be ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us."
In doing so, he stated that the “Operation for the Release of Eastern Ukraine” had been completed.
Perez Hilton erased all the intimacy images of the stars and apologised.
Today, more than 60 Hollywood stars have been terrorized.
Hackers hacked primitive passwords in iCloud in smartphones, after which their intimacy images appeared on the web site of Blogger Perez Hilton.
Not for long, really.
To recall, Jennifer Lawrence, an official of the Star of the Hunger Games, has already reported the theft of photographs from her cell phone, and has also confirmed that all images that are “shining” on the Internet are real.
Perez Hilton, the creator of the same tabloid Web site, apologised to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her workmates for publishing their frank images, writes The Independent.
No, no one made me do it.
I haven't been contacted by their agents.
And now I'm going to delete the candid picture of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice," a Twitter blogger.
But all the candid images of the stars are already on the Internet.

Tony Stuart has an accident back on the track.
Tony Stuart's return to the track was just over in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stuart hit the wall for the second time, after his right front bus exploded on 172 laps, putting an end to his performance.
Stuart took his shattered car to the garage and then left without talking to the reporters.
The head of his team, Chad Johnston, said that 14 team members were upset, but now he's gonna focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I'd like to have a better try and a better finish for him," said Johnston.
We're gonna go to Richmond, and I hope we can do better there.
Stuart first hit a wall earlier in a race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Bush, which required repair to the right side of his car.
"I began today with a pretty big hope to get to the end well," said Johnston, adding, "just failed."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart's car was loaded on the tow truck, and the team was ready to go.
Stuart skipped three NASCAR Spring Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver on the ground track in the North of New York State.
He decided to come back this week, and he needed to win either Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to take part in the chase.
He returned to work in an investigation into a tragic incident, in which a 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. was killed, who was on the track to express his dissatisfaction with Stuart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the cause of the accident would be investigated for at least two more weeks.
No decision was made as to whether Stuart would be charged.
The three-time champ was greeted with loud cheers and applause when he was presented before the race.
Started at 12th position, Stuart was in the first 10 at the start of the race, getting to the fourth position.
Then on 122 laps after Bush's restart number.
The car 18 got off the trajectory on the way out of turn 2 and hit Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart went on, but he's down to position 21.
Sobchak and Vittorgan are having lunch with a cigarette from Guenetski in Odessa.
Xenia Sobchak and Maxim Wittorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV host has not failed to report in her Instagram.
True, one picture was very amazed and very confused by the couple's fans.
The picture was taken from Guenetski.
"At breakfast at Mikhalych Mikhalych Zhenetski Maxim explains what instagrams:) #odessa", he signed a picture of Xenia Sobchak.
But there's nothing on the table but cigarettes.
No coffee, buns, butter, etcetera...
The fans of the couple thought Xyusha was also a smoker, and they condemned her for it.
"Whose cigarettes?, "Smoking kills!", "What kind of a cigarette breakfast" , "Shouldn't it be at lunch, but only cigarettes on the table )) ", "Ksenia, do you smoke too?", agitated for her favorite, the followers of her blog.
Remember, Sobchak recently bragged about what a delicious dinner she had for the first time in her life, Maxime Whitorgan.
"Happy is when you come to the house, and your husband has ready a dinner for you at the time of your visit (for the first time for a marriage, but it's delicious. The main thing is not to say at the end of the supper with the words of anecdote, "so that every day will be," she bragged her husband, Xenia Sobchak.
The picture shows that Maxime is making something with a lot of vigour, and the table is already full of salts and baked chicken.
The Bulgarian prison officers conducted a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria have held a national protest against the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the return of the previous working conditions, which had recently been changed.
Wages are also part of the list of requirements to be discussed with the Acting Minister of Justice, Christo Ivanov.
For a month, the officers protested against the new schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the Prison Service Union met with the Ministry of Justice on a number of occasions, no agreement was reached, it is reported to the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
The negotiations are still under way, as the Head of the General Department for the Enforcement of Sentences, Rosen Gelazkov, has reported to the BND.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protest.
The Army is in control of the new Thai Government
General Prut (right) appointed the Minister of Defence, Prait Wongsuwan (left)
The Thai military ruler and prime minister, General Praut Chan-Ocha, has announced the composition of the new cabinet of the country, in which more than a third of the positions are occupied by the Generals or the Retired Generals.
The army received key positions: the Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praut Chan-Ocha was officially appointed as Prime Minister, following the King of Thailand's formal approval of the appointment of the head of the Interim Military Government to the post.
The 60-year-old military who took power in the country as a result of the bloodless coup d ' état of 22 May was the only candidate for the prime post.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
The army had previously appointed members of Parliament.
According to Prauta Chan-Ouch, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations in which protesters demanded the resignation of the Government of Prime Minister Yingluck Chinavat.
For the record, Praut Chan-Ocha will be a temporary prime minister, as the military is planning to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
But there is a fear that the military is trying to strengthen its authority in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May
With the total paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties have been temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country ' s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Jinglik Chinavat.
Some journalists and public figures have also been detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army removed Brother Yinglik Chinawat Thaksin from his post as Prime Minister.
Both of them enjoy popularity among the rural population, especially in the northern part of the country, which has led to their success in the elections on a number of occasions.
However, many middle-class and capital elites have joined the anti-government movement, which has paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one's ever said it'd be better in a meadine salad, I didn't promise you that, the waitress from the new Palm brasser.
It has to be formally admitted that it is, but the mind and the stomach remain constant.
We all know for a long time, we say "Belgium" -- we mean media, we say "Mids" -- we mean "Belgium."
Restaurants like to say in depth that the success of an institution depends on three factors: location, location, and once again location.
There are places that don't fit well, it's even good, but it's bad luck.
So, when I sat at Palm's table, I remembered that there was once a City Café (after the same TV show), then an Odessa-Mom, and a restaurant called "God" and a "Friends" beer.
Now it's beer again, but it's not nostalgic-soviet, it's Belgian.
Only the tip of the iceberg was placed above the ground: a bar and a couple of tables, and all the rest of the space is devoid of any hint of sunlight.
But it's fun, like in the kids' room: red, yellow, and green walls, colorful chairs, and instead of windows, TVs, where the girls swim.
The Belgian institutions in St. Petersburg are no longer new, so to compare it to something.
There are eight types of spilled beer (260-300 roubles per 0.5 l) and countless bottled beer (170-1550 roubles).
The companist-positive waitress has a fun presentation of the menu, saying, "Mids are full of big seed," and it should be noted that it is the service, despite some of the disadvantages, that is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpectedly.
Well, who, for instance, has to predict that a meat loaf with a Walloon prune (280 roubles) is actually a carpaccio, also cut so thin, that perkament paper would seem uglyly thick in comparison to it.
You can only taste something if you warm up the poultry.
It's worse with the salads.
Classic leash (260) would be the right thing to do to make it a crime against the people of Belgium: some scalding iceberg, once baked a long time ago, scalding Kenyan beans, beans of bacon, and some marooned onions.
You don't want to meet anyone with such a lazy salad!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was not positive either.
If on unripe quarters of tomatoes of cherry or overcooked shampignons it was still possible to close your eyes, why do the mice look like they've been defrosted and cooked a number of times in their life!
I already know there's some pretty normal white sea mice in here!
They're served in pots "in your choice" (490-560 roubles for 0.5 kg).
Sous half a dozen, the one from white wine, celery, and carrots, didn't work out.
Vegetables are there, and there's no flavor, and if there was a wine, it was still a mystery.
Well, they're good at moths with homemade mayonnaise.
Chicken water here is not a sour, so dense, so you can decide, in your mood, the first or second dish in front of you, but just a nice cream soup.
It was said that the bunny was cooked by a local cook in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
On the lookout, the situation was diametrically different: rosemarin suffocated everything.
It seemed that the rabbit had been fed exclusively with rosemary bushes in his lifetime, so that the meat had acquired such an extraordinary fragrance.
But on the other hand, the rabbit's leg was an excellent -- no, just a brilliant pears in a caramelized crust.
The Palm waffles offer not only sweet but also nutritious, with beef, chicken, or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce was too watery, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager on the table was very informally enquiring about the lunch experience.
So we should come again.
The dollar rose to over 37 roubles on the news of new Western sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
By 10:29 a.m., the dollar rose by 26.9 kopecks to 37.02 roubles, and the euro rose by 30 kopecks, up to 48.73 roubles, as shown by the Moscow Exchange.
The currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closure and was worth 42.28 roubles.
Prior to the Crimean events, the dollar peaked on February 19, 2009, at a cost of 36.43 roubles, and on March 3, 2014, it was 37.005 roubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is long-term, with the euro, and with the dollar.
The long-term prognosis presumed this mark, says Anna Bodrova, Senior Analyst of Alpari.
Anything related to Ukraine will be reflected in one way or another in the course.
As long as this goes on, the investors will respond.
Today, the rumours about the invading of troops have been unsubstantiated, but the market has been very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news was cut off yesterday.
The week is expected to close around this level - 36.90 and 37.05 roubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, the price of oil is weak, the policy, the sanctions, the problem of the transit of gas through Ukraine, all the links in the same chain.
Inflation is also expected to rise: from 5 to 10 per cent of current fall prices will be added.
There will soon be an end to seasonal vegetables and fruits, and there will be a vacuum as the nets are redirected to other suppliers.
"The dollar went to the 37 rubles mark, passed it, and went back, some strong hysterical, no," comments the head of the Market Analysing Department, "Opening the Broker," Konstantin Bushuev.
They will still see if the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
The Ruble, he said, was severely weakened by the end of the tax season, followed by news on Ukraine, and the CB last week stated that it was moving completely to a floating rate before the end of the year and was not taking any foreign exchange intervention.
When you look at the day-to-day swing, it's no different from the previous one in the month, and it's just the 37 rubles, and the analyst goes on.
And so, in terms of trade, nothing powerful has happened.
The turbulent times for the currency market were, I'll remind you, when there was a strong demand for the currency at the end of January, as well as the third March, when the CB sent a record number of the currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, it's an increase in the revenue from export operations, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers through import costing, says the Chief Analyst of UFS IC, Alexei Kozlov.
One of the negative aspects is the travel of imported goods and services.
The sharp swings in the Russian currency have significantly reduced the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, led to an increase in inflationary pressures, and, as a result, led to an increase in the cost of borrowing, which in turn is hindering the development of the country’s economy.
As far as the stock market is concerned, the depreciation of the rouble is somewhat flexing down the price of the equities expressed in the roubles.
For example, the MIFB index fell by 1.67 per cent during the trade on Thursday, and the RTS index lost 3.27 per cent.
This significant difference in the relative drop in indexes is due to a reduction of more than 1.5 per cent in the rouble during the day.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is due to a massive desire to buy a currency.
As practice has shown, the emotions are gradually obliterating, and the ruble quotes are either partially or completely reclaiming the lost positions.
"We think we'll soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency at the level of 36 roubles to the dollar," notes Alexei Kozlov.
The genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed.
The British woman reported that she had spent many years thinking she was gonna die after a misdiagnosis.
Caryn Rogers spent most of her teenage life thinking she had only a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had a disease of Charco-Marie-Toot, a group of hereditary disorders that cause nerve damage outside her brain and spine.
The charities organization CMT UK reported that misdiagnosed is a common problem among people with SMTs, because so little is known about this condition.
Some 23,000 people in Britain are believed to have a CMT that can cause motor symptoms, such as muscular weakness, unsure walking, and squeezing toes.
Patients can feel numbness or pain, and the condition is not cured and progressing, which means that the symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from the attack by Friedrich, a state for which the prognosis was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be tied to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "I knew as a child I couldn't do what the others.
I fell every day, and it took me more time.
I've never been able to roller skateboard or skateboard with the other kids, and I've been bullied a lot at school for walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after a few surgeries to release the Achilles tendon and straighten her legs, she looked in the medical file when her doctor left the room, and it said she had AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose where I shouldn't, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I got the information back, I was shaken up, and I got the worst panic I could get.
I thought I was gonna be in a wheelchair at 18:00 and die before I was 25, and I was gonna lose all my powers in this space.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and she asked her doctor.
He just got up, hugged me, and he said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease, 'cause you'd be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you have something that's a much less life-threatening thing.
After a few genetic tests, she was found with a CMT.
"When he explained what SMT was, I thought I'd pulled out a happy ticket," she said.
The British SMT Charitable Organisation has announced a month of information about SMT to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on the businessmen of the Washington zone is on the rise as the economy rebounds
The recovering economy means more customers, more sales, and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
The state and local tax bill for companies across the country has moderately increased last year, when economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and a company in the Washington zone is no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia have combined to pay 27.6 billion dollars to state and local account in fiscal year 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent over the $266.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden on state and local business last year rose by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, as compared to 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after the next year, when the accounts fell, in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes have increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to a study done by a professional service firm, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county ' s tax revenue, 56 per cent, is from business taxes, while 36 per cent of Maryland ' s tax revenue is from firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, generates the lowest level of tax revenue, proportionally from business.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to the return to the value of the real property of companies, according to researchers, which raised real property taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years of growth of less than 1 per cent.
While large states, such as California, New York, and Texas, account for a large share of this revenue, the same seems to be happening in the Washington zone.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia have combined to pay $10 billion in real property taxes on the state and local level last year, an increase of $9.6 billion over 2012 - an increase of 4.2 per cent over the previous year.
However, the observed return of real property value has no similar effect on the rise in state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real property taxes are just over one-fifth of the company ' s tax accounts.
Virginia and D.C. companies pay about half of state and local tax accounts in the form of real property taxes.
"What's going on in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around D.C., belongs either to the government or to a non-profit organization that does not pay the property tax," said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the State Taxation Center.
So Maryland has to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are available in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from business cannot be fully explained by the re-emerging of the real estate market.
Business income also seems to be on the same page, according to this data.
Firms in the region have declared a state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion over 2012.
Maryland raised $1 billion in corporate income tax, most of it in the region.
Although the trends are in the same direction, the tax burden on entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase at the same rate in all three locations.
The level of growth in the U.S. was the same as the national average, 4.3 per cent, while the growth in Maryland was much faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenue rose below the average of 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, there was the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) of 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the county it is relatively high at 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year revealed that Virginia has lower taxes on state and local business and, in general, a more favourable climate in terms of taxes on businessmen than in Maryland.
The county was not estimated in this study.
Despite her advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from her neighbour from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed a law lowering the corporate rate from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent this year, as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continued to meet its tax revenue targets next year, the law could have raised the rate of income tax for business even to 3 per cent by 2017.
In the meantime, the small business in the Washington zone seems to be feeling better, and so it pays more state and local taxes, according to a recent study.
Taxes to entrepreneurs in the form of an individual income tax from small business owners - the transition structure that is used by most small firms - in the County of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher rate of growth than the taxes on entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in business tax revenues is likely to continue this year, with the revenue of the state and local trade tax, which rose by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 as compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington zone may lag behind, as lower federal spending has an impact on the region ' s labour market.
The Bronze Age of the Russian judo
The Judo World Cup brought two silver and seven bronze awards to Russia.
By this rate, the Russians have only given up the major favor of the Japanese competition.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk began on Monday, and the first day brought a silver medal to the Russian team.
Beslan wisenov, who was in the category of up to 60 kg, was the owner.
In an equal final struggle with Boldbat Ganbat from Mongolia, however, the outcome of the stand-off was a single comment from the Russian.
And the second day of the tournament was the most successful for Russia, and three medals were won on Tuesday.
In men's competitions, up to 66 kg of silver was given to Mikhail Pulyaev and bronze to Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian won the 2011 and 2013 world champion, Massashi Ebinume.
Han-Magomedov, who had lost a compatriot in the quarter-final stage, was victorious in a consolation tournament and was the owner of a bronze award.
In the women's tournament, up to 52 kg, Natalia Kusutina also reached the third grade.
In the semi-final, she lost an active world champion, Mailinda Kelmendi, from Kosovo, who played under the flag of the International Federation of Judo and successfully defended the title.
In the argument for the bronze, Kusutin won Ma Inan from China, but after she finished the tournament, she admitted that third place was not what she was hoping for.
Once again, Kelmendi, who had won Kusutina earlier in the European Finals, was a barrier to the Russians' path to gold.
On the third day of the Chelyabinsk tournament, the Russians put bronze in the back of the Russian team, which was in the category of up to 73 kg.
In the quarterfinals, he was abused by a former Moldavia representative, Victor Skohortsov, who is now a member of the UAE team.
But then the Russian won two fights and became a rewarder.
The Majors played at the Home Cup with a holnostop injury, which he plans to heal in the near future, so he will pause in the competition.
As for the ex-Moldovan Svortsov, he and he got to the bronze medal at this tournament.
Interestingly, another member of his country, who had acquired UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko, with a bronze, completed his performance in the category of up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the CM-2014 also brought the Russians one bronze, which in the category of up to 81 kg was conquered by Ivan Nifontov.
In the hard battle of the small finale, he was defeated by the opponent, Alan Schmitt.
On Friday, the tournament was played at the same time by three sets of awards, but the Russians traditionally confined themselves to a single bronze in the men's tournament to 90 kg.
She was the owner of the questions, and the Russian team was assured of the medal: his competitor in the comforting final was a fellow countryman, Kirill Denisov.
However, the contraction did not take place: the opponent of the question was unable to reach out to the Tatoms due to the injury.
The man's bronze was conquered by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - it was put in the pool by Renate Saidov, who was in the category of over 100 kg.
In the comforting finale, he won a pure victory over the Brazilian David Moura.
That's how the individual part of the world's supremacy ended.
On the last day of the Chelyabinsk tournament, on Sunday, the world's championships were played in team competitions.
The two Russian teams, both male and female, were among the main bidders for the award, but, as in the individual competitions, the representatives of the beautiful sex were unlucky - they didn't get to the Medal.
The Russian judoists, on the other hand, have won the command silver.
In a decisive stand-up, in a persistent struggle with the score of 2-3, they gave up to Japan’s team’s major fans of the competition.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after the pure victory of Khan-Magomedov and by the will of Denis Yartsev (up to 73 kg).
But in the more heavy weight categories, with their Japanese rivals, Murat Habatchirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiyev (100) failed.
The same scenario also led to a bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian team, with 2-0, gave way to Japanns - 2-3.
The Russian president, Wladimir Poetin, was present at the Chelyabinsk team, who, after the end of the tournament, congratulated the men's silver team.
"The second place is a very honorable one, but I want to say that it was clear that you could be the champions," said Putin, whose words are RIA's "News."
To lose to the Japanese, to the judo leaders, there's nothing wrong with it.
But I'm sure you can win from them.
Russia's team at the home world championship was much better than it was a year ago at a level like that held in Rio.
At the time, the Russian team had only three medals, one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by the Arsen Galstyan and Mansour Isaev Olympic Champions.
We're all, of course, big maximalists.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember, if a man in the Olympic cycle is in the top eight, he's a potential winner of the Olympics.
In a sport like judo, the Russian Minister of Sport, Vitaly Mutko, summed up the results of the tournament.
Japan's team was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various dignity, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will take place in the summer of next year in Astana.

Joan Rivers' family hope for the best
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her arrival at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter has expressed her hope today that an 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in her statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday, following an emergency call that she had a cardiac cardiac arrest at a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopie, reporting to the source.
The doctors are deliberately keeping her under narcose and under strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which is still “heavy”.
The response was wide, including multiple Internet support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Repa.
The kings will be able to do it.
The band's debut album, "Royal Blood", was a new hope for British rock, which brought rock duets out of the clubs straight to the stadiums.
The Royal Blood duo has only been on the stage for a year, but has already been nominated for the BBC Music Award, the Arctic Monkeys Opener Tour, and a visit to the New York dressing room from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut single album received 100,000 pre-orders a few months before the release, and the contract for its release is in the Warner Music Major label.
In view of the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation is a lot worse than the new lana Del Rey or another sweet-voice representative of the "new R'n'B", but a duo of British-like bullies playing with the volume and intensity that was last in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the stakes for the first album for all the above-mentioned circumstances have been particularly high and have already been fully justified.
The duo didn't have to take a name that could have been invaded before, except for a very desperate, hairy metallist, and the blood of which kings, they think, are running in their veins, too.
This is, of course, first of all about the characters at the last level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood is designed to shake the stagnant blood of British rock, leading it to a new height.
Prognosing the success of this business may be a bit early, but there are some things that can be said.
A dozen songs in 30 minutes is not so much a presentation of a phenomenal composing gift as a strong and strong declaration of intent.
Of course, some of the merits of individual numbers cannot be denied: let's say the pilot single "Out of the Black" is a drum band, not a melodic line.
The musicians joke about this song being even easier to rat than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing record of the "Better Stringers" with a Shakespeare quote in the title.
The truth, however, is that each of these songs will sound great at a heavy rock party, but when played in a row, they converge into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And it's not necessarily bad, even the other way around.
Royal Blood's power is that they don't claim credit for the new Lennons and McCartneys (previously being labelled Motjörhead's successors), but they've got a lot of rock-duettes out of the ghetto indies.
Their music, despite some diversity, is made for stadiums, in a space of less than a couple of thousands of people, and it's obviously narrow.
The secret is, in part, the tricky use of bass, which replaces the guitar in a common format that was invented at the start of the "White Strikes".
But it's not just about the tools, it's about the way we write the songs.
The heroes of the Zero Retroroc was very hard to choose beyond the postmodern paradigm, and they were very reluctant to accept themselves as separate creative units, not just epigons.
Royal Blood is already sounding so strong and insolent that it has been successful in embracing some of the repetitiveness and hardness of the musical material.
And in the end, who said rock has to be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMASON has just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: an online shop and a video producer, and a hundred other things - he buys a Twitch streaming video service for $1.04 billion (US970 million).
This news was a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected Youtube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, selling Twitch to Google's video service for a good billion looked complete, and that combination was natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set out to be a streaming service of a general nature, a YouTube version in real time.
Instead, it quickly turned into a platform where gamers aired their inner-game moments; "Youtube for real-time games", says Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos where all-Knowledge people (mainly old) play games like "The Mystery Theater" are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is, YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that Youtube is buying Twitch has been met with no particular interest, a classic example of a well-established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It's a secret why the YouTube deal failed, given that, according to information, he was willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from Chief Executive Officer Twitch Emmett Shear: "We have chosen Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us get to them faster."
Another secret, to be fair, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me, who say they're gonna do better sports than watch it, it's hard to see the attractiveness of watching a game instead of getting a joystick on their own.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3:00 a.m., when she crawls through the Resident Evil, and it's a very different thing to watch some outsider get 20 shots in the head in a row at Call of Duty.
All the games you can watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them, without controlling the angle of view on their own, can be a recipe for a headache worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speeds in which the Rogers Bannisters of this e-century complete the game in record time are entertaining.
But if it's not a virtual game or a humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will be even interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and this is the fourth-largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon make it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch will go to Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could just absorb Twitch.
But Twitch has something that any company would love to get: a mob of young men that advertisers want.
As the head of Twitch Shire, Amazon, and Twitch said, "the two believe in the future of the game," and this channel does not show any sign of oblivion, even - oh - as an entertaining sport.
The 2004 attack killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to the surviving hostages - almost all of the students now, to the dead's parents, to the cemetery keeper - the City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, head of the Mother Beslan committee, Susan Doudieva, who took part in the special operation by a member of the MES, says Elizabeth Antonov, a reporter of the Social Department, who was working on a special project.
Upon his return to Moscow, he met with Aslambek Aslahanov, who 10 years ago was an adviser to the President on the North Caucasus and was negotiating with the terrorists, as well as with the FSB 'Supervisor Vyacheslav Bocharov of Russia.
What's really shaken me over the time I've been working on this subject is that Beslan didn't seem to have been there for ten years.
The subject is very painful for everyone who has anything to do with it, and people find it hard to talk about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very heavy.
But we can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job," said Antonov.
A special project was developed by Rambler & Co's Infographic Holding Studio, which has been working for the company since spring.
Previous special projects focused on the First World War and the 15th birthday of Vladimir Putin in power.
The Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea launched a short-range missile
North Korea launched a short-range missile in the Japan Sea, reports Renhop.
The launch was carried out around 10:30 a.m. local time by the province of Chagando, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
The missile was supposed to have fallen into the Japanese Sea, flying some 220 km, and was reported to the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee.
Members of Parliament proposed to speed up the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative is successful, the Russians will not be able to keep the data on servers abroad from 1 January 2015
A bill has been submitted to the State Duma to reschedule the date of entry into force of the Russian Personal Data Act, from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative framework of the lower house.
It was co-sponsored by members of the State Duma Vadim Tholin, Jaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeniy Fedorov (One Russia), Vladimir Parahin (Just Russia) and Alexander Jushchenko (CPRF).
Such a change, in the view of the proponents of the initiative, would help to ensure more quickly and effectively the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the preservation of personal data and to respect the secrecy of correspondence in the information and telecommunications network.
The Act, the entry into force of which is hastened by parliamentarians, requires Russians to keep their personal data on the Internet in the Russian Federation.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, store, store, clarify and extract the personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation in the databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as to indicate the location of such databases.
The Act also entitles Roskomnadzor, on the basis of a court decision, to limit access to information processed in violation of the Russian legislation on personal data.
The Act also proposes the creation of so-called “blacklists” of offending websites, an automated information system, “The Register of Perpetrators of the Rights of Personal Data Entities”.
This law was passed by the State of the State in the summer.
The bill was authored by Andrei Lugovoy and Vadim Follin of LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko of CPDF.
Money and Yushchenko are also co-authors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the Act.
Those who don't have data centres in the Russian Federation will have to pay for the rent.
Commenting on the bill currently before the State Duma, the first head of the Douma Information Policy Committee, Leonid Levin, stated that he saw no problem in rescheduling the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
According to him, those companies that will not have their own data warehouses for Russians in the Russian Federation by 1 January 2015 would be able to lease them, for example, to Rostelecoma, who has repeatedly said that they are ready to lease their servers and are already providing their servers, to Mail Group, Western companies that are now providing their servers.
"In addition, there are a few independent data centres ready to cooperate in this field," he added.
"If the companies decide to implement the law and continue to work in the Russian Federation, I see no problem - they will have the technological space for accommodation," summed up Levin.
Disputing Bill
Immediately after the bill was published, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed concern that, if the bill was passed, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, it is the online booking of airfares and hotels.
In the view of the association, “the bill deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data, making it imperative that their record-keeping, systematization, etc. be ensured only in the databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to set up a mechanism to inform the user of the location of the record, to systematize his/her personal data.
In such a case, it will be possible to choose the territory in which the said actions will be carried out.
The adoption of such legislation to “localize” personal data in other countries has led to the loss of global services and to significant economic losses.
Participant of the test with a bucket of ice water twisted her jaw
Isabelle Roberts, from the United Kingdom, yelled so hard when ice water was poured out on her head, damaging the bone structure of her face.
This test by a bucket of ice water went wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she was so yelling during the test with a bucket of ice water that she twisted her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts yelled so fervently when the ice water was poured out on her head that it damaged her facial structure.
"The water was so cold, I yelled, but when I was doing it, my jaw began to get stuck," she said to The Mirror.
The water's on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts, seconds before the accident.
I tried to shut my mouth, but it didn't close, it was stuck, and then it came to me that something was wrong.
Then my mom and my sister got the same understanding, and they began to laugh, but I had to be taken to the E.R.
A 20-year-old woman from the United Kingdom was taken to the hospital to fix her jaw after taking part in a popular festivities on Tuesday.
The video became an Internet-sensation and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The U.S. Army handed over more than 400 prisoners
The Army of Novorossia claims to have hit the Ukrainian Su-27, and denounced the opponent for violating the cease-fire agreement.
As at 10 a.m. on 1 September, the military handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax by a representative of the press service of the Army of Novorossia.
He added that “by air defence forces in the area of Mereška, Su-27 aircraft was shot down, in violation of the cease-fire arrangements”.
According to the Agency ' s interlocutor, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions when shelling Lugano airport.
The Spokesman noted that the militia had been able to damage two Ukrainian air force helicopters at one of the field airfields overnight, as well as to destroy two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
"The casualties in the enemy's life - up to a hundred dead and wounded, have been surrendered to thirteen men," summed up the staff representative.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed groups of the “People's Republics” of Donbassa announced the transfer to the Ukrainian side, within the framework of the cease-fire regime, of 223 prisoners and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, at night, the NPD Army, according to the Army of Novorossia, “stopped an attempt by the National Guards in violation of earlier agreements to remove heavy equipment from the area”.
The militia then reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs in a short-term combat, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 military personnel.
According to the headquarters, the total loss of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariupol) during that night was five tanks, eight armoured combat vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian troops was surrounded by militias in the Ilowaysk area of Donetsk oblast.
Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, has asked the leadership of the “people's republics” to release Ukrainian troops from the environment.
In the DNR, they agreed to do so on the condition that the enemy surrendered arms and ammunition.
The first tens of soldiers began to leave the surrounding localities on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion, Donbass, Semen Semenchenko, an additional 14 people left the Cotla on Sunday night.
In his Facebook account, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are "in captivity to the 137 regiments of the 32nd Division of the Russian Federation and the 9th Tank Brigade of the Russian Federation" where they are treated well.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence of Russia have disproved reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO of the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
MID of the Russian Federation: Russia will respond if the EU imposes new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take action to protect its legitimate interests in the event of the imposition of new anti-Russian sanctions, as reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
A report from the Russian Foreign Diplomacy Department states that the “convictions” of the European Council of 30 August have demonstrated the failure of the EU member countries to overcome the inertia of their unspeakable support for the Kyiv authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, on the basis of “absolutely unsubstantiated allegations of the presence of the Russian Armed Forces on the territory of that country”, as stated on the agency's website.
The MFA of the Russian Federation deplores the fact that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member States, is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in intensifying their confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as for a full-fledged “dialogue between the warring parties”, underscores the agency.
The agency ' s website also states that there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbassa, where there has been a full-scale humanitarian disaster, as well as an increasing number of civilian casualties.
Let us recall that within the next seven-day period, the European Union is planning to develop specific proposals on sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, EU representatives are working closely with American officials.
It is expected that they will correlate the measures taken over the period of validity and severity.
New EU sanctions can affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an expansion of the sanctions on Russia in the areas of defence, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Violent ways to save on university textbooks
With the cost of university textbooks for many students in excess of $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who is about to go to second grade, has come up with a tricky way to cut the cost.
He developed a system of how to lease books from seniors, offering nominal compensation to them to delay their sale.
"My textbook on math, which is usually $180, I got a semester for $10 and a cookie for "Chick-fil-A," says Schroeder, 19 years old, who is a student at the College Covent in Georgia.
The necessary literature for the last semester would have cost $430, he says.
He spent 120 dollars.
According to the College Board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and apprentices, but the student has a number of options to reduce the cost.
Students are increasingly choosing Internet shops and creative ideas like the Schroeder system.
Book rents are becoming more popular, allowing students to use the book for a semester, and are often much less expensive than buying it.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookshops, reports that the volume of book rentals has doubled since 2011.
Industry studies show that about a quarter of the books in university bookshops during the last spring semester have been leased, says the vice-president of Nibo, Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookshops, according to the professional association National Association of University Stores.
Here's an introductory course on how best to make a lucrative deal.
Online shopping
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one-third of what you see at the university bookstore.
The ninth edition of Mathematical Analyse by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler is about $290 on the list, but a new copy can be bought for 239.99 on the Web site of Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Buying used
If you don't mind someone's mark or injury, used textbooks are a good option.
The Mathematical Analyse is sold for $93.49 in use on Chegg.com.
Matt Kasadei, 25, a fourth-year student from Brigam Young University, says he paid 42 cents for Amazon.com for a second-hand version of the textbook "Strategic Media Solutions: Understanding the Business of Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48 new.
Professors such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the College without Walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, invite students to ask their professors if previous editions can be used.
Sometimes the renewals are not relevant to the class.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small share of the value of the last edition.
In addition to the websites of Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to the purchase of used books.
Leasing
The idea of renting a textbook is to think, if you treat it well enough, you don't forget to get it back, and you don't want to keep it after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent a "Mathematic Analyse" for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the shop where you pick up the books, including any fines you can make for the markings, accentuation, and damage.
If you rent a book, remember, if you do not return the book, the fines can even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
E-books, instead of traditional textbooks, are another option.
At times, such books are leased for a period of time from the distributors, such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematic Analysis" on Chegg.com will cost about $61 for six months.
Bracey says that students who study literature can often find the most lucrative prices, as many classical works can now be downloaded free of charge, while literature in natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look around.
Joe Galt, 29 years old, who is about to go to Pepperdin School of Law, recommends using the ISBN number to check the price of a book, as it guarantees you that you are looking for the text you need.
Before ordering on the Internet, Galt says, make sure you see if the book is in the warehouse.
He didn't have a hard lesson.
The delivery of the book he bought was postponed for four weeks, and he eventually paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin stated that the Far East Development Fund was inefficient
Russia’s President, Wladimir Poetin, was at a meeting on the control of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East, and that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, was inefficient, is reported by Interfax.
"15 billion roubles are still on the deposits," the President stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State requested that the approval of the list of pre-developing territories in the Far East be expedited.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of the TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this fall.
The Federal Assembly, noted the President, had not approved the list of pre-development territories in the Far East and their criteria until 1 July.
Vladimir Putin has also set out the main challenges for the development of the Far East.
These include improving the region ' s accessibility to transport, removing infrastructural constraints, both on the domestic market and for export development.
Among other things, there is a need to create the prerequisites for attracting additional investment to the region, as well as for the creation of pre-development areas to become competitive with the key business centres of the APR, the President stressed.
Let us recall that it has been previously reported that the Territory of Pre-Developing Development can replace the EEZ.
Why Watch the Galaxy couldn't save the cashier's fees
Sylvester Stallone's unstoppable 3 has returned less than $30 million from her $90 million budget in the United States, while "City of Sins: The Woman for Who Kills" has returned only $12 million from her $70 million budget.
Home Videos with Cameron Diaz brought only $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's films, such as "How to tame dragon 2" also disappoint the profit.
The Telegraph article by Robby Colleen points out that when it comes to children's movies, it may be about the bad quality of the films themselves.
Colleen called 2014 the "worst" year in the history of children's movies, and he called "How to tame dragon 2" a barely "functioning" continuation of fantasy.
However, when it comes to films that target a few older audiences, the problem does not necessarily lie in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic for every movie that was leased in the summer with at least 2,000 copies between the Day of Remembrance in May and 20 July, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the view of both the viewers and the critics, suggest that this year's film yield is similar to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that this may be about changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of streaming Internet services, such as Netflix.
Directed by John Fauro, who is currently working on a fast-running Disney movie, "The Book of the Dschungel" said to Hollywood Reporter's website, "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what was before.
In contrast to the current fall in cash charges in Hollywood, Netflix's income from the streaming replication service was $1.2 billion, almost double last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Stephen Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comics franchises, and foretelling Hollywood's "scratch."
In the light of the current recession, some commentators claim that there was some truth in his gloomy predictions.
As a number of potential cashier hits are expected in the summer of 2015, including the Avengers: The Ages of Altron, the Minionos and the Jurassic Park, others in the movie industry are more optimistic.
"People of H" Simon Kinberg recently called a drop in cash just "circle," he said to Hollywood Reporter, "The next summer will be the cashier summer in history, and no one will be worried about it."
Productive sanctions do not frighten the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants in Europe and Japan, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
Generally speaking, the common market has so far preferred to replace banned imports with products from Latin America, Israel, and China, not from Russia.
"Better there's a low-salt cucumber than a bad mozzarella," lamented the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio about the quality of the cheese that the suppliers offer him in exchange for the Italians.
Mozzarella and the burratea cheese ended at the restaurant first, with a short period of storage.
Parmesan must be available for a few more months.
What do we do?
Go to Russian?
In 2005, I was at the Dorogomil market.
Mariano Valerio makes such an eye, which is clear: Shocking memories do not let him go until now.
The meat was on the carts just 30 centimetres from the floor!
It's cats!
Rats!
So I said, for our restaurant, we're never gonna buy anything from the Russian market.
I don't know, maybe things have changed now.
But the other day, I got fish from the Far East for a test.
So it turned out to be bad!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio marvels at the fact that many of Italy’s usual things are for a Russian manufacturer in wildness.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in a cooling cell for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It has to hang out to be soft, so that the muscles relax.
I've done all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where'd you get such sweet meat?"
I told you, it's yours, you Russians!
Why don't you guys do that?
At five minutes of walking from the Barlotti in the French restaurant Brassery Bridge, there's a stop-list in the kitchen that lists the missing items: French oysters, seafood.
The chef of the Bressery Bridge and the Shot bar, Régis Trigel, is less pessimistic than Valerio: the oysters from France have already replaced the oysters from Tunisia, and instead of the French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
And Régis is more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Blue cabbage: 200 roubles!
I say, "Why, on what basis is it so expensive?"
They say, "Well, we have to make money too."
But this cabbage shouldn't be worth more than 80 rubles!
Far East oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15-20 years, you know how much their shell weighs?
The price is that it's super-delicate.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of fear for foreign cooks.
The standard story is, "The first three months were all right, then quality fell."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibre and quality.
A lot of restaurants in Europe don't know what's gonna happen to them when they run out of cheese.

Sentence Menu
On 6 August, President Wladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure Russia's security, which are mostly called food sanctions.
The import of beef, pork, meat and co-products from poultry, meat delicacy, fish, clams, milk, yogurts, tomatoes, cheese, vegetables, fruit, peanuts, sausages and sugar syrups is prohibited.
Restaurants have started shopping with suppliers: the prices of food have risen, and we need to look for analogues from other countries.
This will have the greatest impact on expensive restaurants with monocourage in France, Italy, Spain, where the products were delivered directly from the “materian” countries.
The commons have had to be reconfigured before.
For example, when Rosselhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef in early 2014, and a year earlier the import of American and Canadian meat.
In return, the suppliers made deliveries of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the summer 2014 sanctions have been far more severe.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved the amendments to the presidential decree, which debar the male Atlantic salmon and trout, lactonous milk, seed potatoes, sugar maize, peas and onions for planting.
The Italian man, Valerio, hopes that the sanctions can still be relaxed.
In the meantime, some of the restaurants exist in an uncertain environment.
According to East West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imports in the bonus segment was up to 70 per cent.
"Dear restaurants will have to change the menu to what local farmers and other countries do," says Sergey Mironov, a staykeeper, the owner of Restconsult.
If the chef is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
But we have very few cooks like this, and it can take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from Brassery Bridge is ready for this: we're gonna have to give up 10-15% of the dishes, half the menu's gonna be reworked.
In mixed-cooked restaurants, foods like marble beef beef are already being replaced, says Sergey Mironov.
"Cyres from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Chile, Tunisia, Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of East West.
Cream and dairy from Europe are analogous to Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the United States can be replaced by a hen from Russia and Belarus, a salmon and a seed from Norway, a salmon, a semgo, a trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of European vegetables and fruits can be offset by domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget online restaurants will be more easily reconfigured than the bonus segment: there are hardly gourmets that can distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian.
Although it's gonna be hard for Ginza Projects, he thinks.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants with different brands and menus.
It's gonna take a lot of time to replace you," says Mironov.
In Ginza, no comments were given, citing the absence of owners in the country.
The owners of the Caucasian and Central Asian Cafés stress that the products from the former Soviet republics are more flavorful than the Europeans.
But there are a lot of restaurants that the sanctions are not going to touch.
These include institutions with the Kitchen of the Commonwealth of Independent States: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive foods in the Georgian Kitchen," says Hatuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the "Wai Me!" Café.
All the cheeses are made for us in Russia, and we don't use exotic greens at the root of many dishes.
No dishes have yet been removed from the menu at Cohle.
Timur Lanski, the owner of Chichon N1 restaurants with Uzbek kitchens, the sanctions don't make any sense, he'll only have to change lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia were to import from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we would even win the price, it would be cheaper for us than it would for us to import from Europe, he said.
You can get cheaper cuts, lambs, tomatoes, cucumbers, and fruit.
But what comes from Central Asia is much better than a “plastic” from Italy, Spain, and Turkey.
We all know about Uzbek tomatoes that they're delicious, sweet.
No one speaks of Spanish like that.
After the imposition of the sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of the Environment of Uzbekistan, Olymboy Artikov, stated that he was planning to double the export of fruit-bearing products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan declared their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of the sanctions.
The fastfood restaurants that responded to the "Dengue" request are also quite quietly responding to the sanctions.
McDonald's press said that localization was over 85%, and the network was working with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of Subway Russia's supplier department, about 80 per cent of the products are being purchased by the network in Russia, although the supply of vegetables and the price of meat from imported raw materials may be time-consuming.
In the “Tremke”, “sanctioned products” were not more than 4 per cent.
The sanctions and the Vocker noodle have not been affected.
KFC, Burger King and "Child Potato" did not respond to the "Deng" request, but other market participants argue that Burger King is much less localized than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, the resters are ready to buy more Chilean than Russian Far East.
On his buckle
For the time being, the moratoriums have been complaining that, due to an increase in demand, even local foods are on the rise.
“The average price for Grabley's products rose by 10-15%, and for the Italian restaurant "Cerry Meo" by half,” says the restator Roman Rosenkovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of the dishes will grow by 5 to 10 per cent, admits Kolbaya.
East-West does not deny this: “For example, Belarusian dairy products have cost 10-15% since the beginning of August.
"The Brazilian suppliers have almost doubled the price of pork," complains Sergey Rak, Deputy Director General of Stardogs.
Chicken ham traveled 35%.
Waiting for China's prices, maybe they'll cool off the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned 8% increase in prices.
Now it's very unwelcome to raise the price, "speaks the cancer.
According to the statistics, the increase in the general supply in the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8%.
This is the smallest number since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is not clear how fast it is: while most retortortors have been saving up for the next two months in the hope of waiting for the swings in the purchase price.
But what happens in two months, no one knows.
In front of the city hall of Moscow, there are ten tents decorated with green and wood.
In the middle of the scene, the musicians play waltz.
It's a regional food festival with the fun name "There's Time."
"We've been going to do a local food holiday for a long time, and this is where the sanctions are, we hastened, we set up a festival," says one of the organizers.
Behind the scene with the musicians, the Greek cook Anastas cooks a macaroni salad and homemade candy, and there was a master class the other day to make borsche with caramelized apples.
All of Russia's products, tell the organizers.
In the tents, an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian national economy.
Med from Bashkiria, reindeer from Salehard, veggies from "Lenin Soul", cheese from a crumbling Italian Jay Clouse.
"A fish for restaurants can be easily replaced by another fish of salmon from the Far East," says Philip Galkin, the owner of his fish shop.
We're catching nerks, kettles, cucumbers, boobs, chalices - "Kings of salmon."
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon, 'cause it's a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take it in your hand, it doesn't even move.
And you can't hold our far-eastern salmon.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace Italian mozzarella with domestic
In the window of his tent are shrimps with a tag called Magadan, cod, omul, muzzle, meadows from Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin's sure it's time to go to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, fish catches in Russia in 2013 are over 4 million tons, and a large proportion of fish go to Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are about 800,000 tons.
The boot, "My People" has been working since 2012, sells fish via an Internet shop, and has served a dozen more restaurants, such as "Simple Things", before the sanctions were imposed.
Now, there are 15 more restaurants that have applied to Galkin.
The same sushi can be made of our fish, he's hot.
We've got a bit of a problem, we've tried a lot of prescriptions.
Now we sell sushi on an Internet shop for a million roubles a month.
Our fish are a few times cheaper, and delivery is a maximum of 15 roubles per pound.
As a confirmation in Galkin's tent, I'm getting a shot of "Filadelphia" with a kettle.
In contrast to the seven rolls, these have to be chewing longer, but the realization that this fish is ours, the national fish, gives us strength.
There's even halibut rolls and sea bass on the website of "My People" shop.
In sushi bars, it is true that the replacement of Norwegian salmon is preferred to Chilean salmon.
Galkin explains this because the cooks are lazy to come up with new recipes for long-eastern fish.
"The Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us," explains the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitri Eusev.
The situation is similar to that of other products: Russian producers could have taken up a free niche, but this is not the case.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project, Boris Akimov, it is now possible to talk more about the import of imports from Europe and America from China, Israel, and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and large quantities.
They can fast replace banned imports, unlike our farmers.
That is to say, the ban will be won in the first place by the major producers of other countries,” says Akimov.
In the last month, however, the restaurant industry received a more disturbing signal than food sanctions.
In the wake of the mass unplanned checks, the three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
“We are looking at the nature of the claims in order to determine the actions required for the prompt opening of restaurants for visitors”, stated the McDonald's press office “the money”.
No one really understands what's next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, it is one option that can be survived, an anonymously speaking company’s catering company.
But if they start closing McDonald's all over the country, the script will be very different.
"Europrotocol" in place of HIDB reference
Casco payments can be made without the help of GIELD, so the CB will encourage the introduction of the Europrotocol in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has drawn up draft guidelines according to which, from 1 September of this year, an insurable motorist will be able to do without a GIEACPC certificate.
It is true that this is only a case in which the incident was documented on a “europrotocol” without the involvement of the road police.
So if there were only two cars involved in the accident, there were no physical injuries, the damage did not exceed the limit, and the two drivers agreed on who was responsible for the accident.
Since 2 August, the europrotocol limit is 50,000 roubles, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad oblasts, it will be raised to 400,000 roubles.
The point is, often even in the event of minor damage, in a situation in which an accident can be handled by a “europrotocol”, drivers who have been in an accident call for a DPS.
After all, if there was a casco policy, it would not have been possible to obtain compensation for it without a GIEACPC certificate.
The parameters set out in the draft guideline are intended to remove this obstacle to the introduction of the Europrotocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment for a casco for an unmanned accident by GIELD should not be lower than the limit for the Europrotocol.
At the same time, however, it cannot be above the limit set out in the Casco Insurance.
The idea is, of course, useful and theoretically able to unload both the DPS and the roads.
But it's probably not going to make the motorists or the insurers happy.
The latter already point to a serious risk of an increase in fraud, which may result from the introduction of new rules for the payment of cash.
As far as drivers are concerned, it is hard to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
The driver will, in most cases, wait hours for an inspector to take care of a minor accident, because it's more secure.
And we don't know what it's gonna be easy to beat the crooks or to convince the drivers of the trustworthiness of the Europrotocol.
Saving certificate will make name and irrevocable
The Minfin wants to ban bearer saving certificates, but will let the banks make them the equivalent of irrevocable contributions.
The Minfin is preparing a bill to prohibit bearer saving certificates.
This tool has recently become more popular, as the stakes here are higher than on bank deposits.
The reason is that the bearer's savings certificates do not go to the deposit insurance system, and the bank is less expensive, as there is no need to contribute to the Treasurer Insurance Agency (CAA).
The picnicity of the situation is that this step is to be taken by small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, and will be affected by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which are estimated by the ASB to control 98 per cent of the relevant market.
The Bank of Moscow has an estimated share of about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained in the ASA, is that the customers of a small bank who have bought such a certificate, if their license is revoked, try to get the money from the ASA.
Some depositors, without sufficient financial literacy and with the purchase of bearer ' s savings certificates, may assume that their investment is insured.
A well-founded lack of insurance for these certificates, if the bank's license is withdrawn, can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency, there have been cases in which bearer of the bearer's certificates have sought to recover insurance through the court,” the ASA stated.
The problem, of course, is inconceivable.
After all, no one will pay the buyers of the certificates, as they have no legal right to be reimbursed by the State.
If the instrument was not covered by the ASA, it would also prohibit metal accounts in which the funds of the citizens are recorded in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts do not go to the deposit insurance system either, but their existence is not yet at risk.
The fact is, perhaps, that bearer certificates are a very handy securities, which can in fact be a quasi-denegue.
Their movement is, however, almost unchecked: any bank customer can buy a certificate, hand it over to any citizen, and before cashing it out, a lot of owners can change.
It was no coincidence that the bill stipulated that a saving certificate must be a specific security document to be kept in the depository.
And to sweeten the pill to the banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right to pre-default.
That is to say, the analogy of an irrevocable contribution that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protest in Newport and Cardiff
This weekend, protesters protested against the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for what was described as antisummit.
Stephen Fairklow has been following the events for us over the weekend and talking to protesters from all over, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will be supplying arms to Iraq to counter militants from the Islamic State terrorist group, reporting on 31 August to ITAR-TASS, with reference to the decision taken at the end of the meeting of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reported to send 30 Milan portable anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
The deliveries will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it has been decided to allocate an additional 50 million Euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Mrs. Merkel will deliver a government statement in the Bundestag on this subject.
So far, Germany has not supplied its weapons to hot spots.
The views of the people of the Federal Republic of Iran on the transfer of arms to the Iraqis have been divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the militants of the Islamic State, while others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militia hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
The Donetsi militia bombarded a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reporting on 31 August to ITAR-TASS.
This was reported to have taken place in the Taganrog Bay near the towns of Chirokino and Benomnoy (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media report that two shoreguard boats have been bombed.
It is clear that the incident took place today at about 4:20 p.m.
Teenagers were taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
TWO of the young boy Bushhuoker was taken by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went camping shortly after Sunday at Gowetts Lip in Blackhit.
The concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team, including local police and rescue units, was sent out, and a couple were found around 11 p.m. near the Bridal Vale Falls.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell down and hit her head.
The officers stayed with a couple for the night, and they got up at the winch on Monday morning.
They were taken in an ambulance in a stable state to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two Unions Meeting
The high-level talks in Minsk have not solved the problems for which they have been convened but have created a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future of the Eurasian Union.
Even if it is a worrisome matter (the situation around Ukraine cannot be held late), the EU and the Customs Union have for the first time discussed a number of “hot problems”.
Whether such a structure can work effectively is not clear; however, it is clear who removed the cream from this summit.
The questions in this regard fell off on the evening of August 26, when the Belarusians, followed by the rest of the Europeans, saw the new president, Lukashenko, in the news.
The Belorussian leader set an example of a well-defined politeness, it was the behavior of a man who just hit the jackpot -- and was planning a decent old age in a higher society.
How Maidan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival of the three main European commissioners (EU ministers) in Minsk, who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to address the final briefing on their behalf, is not just a legitimation of a 20-year-old president.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European politics and as the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior Analyst of the Belarus Institute for Strategic Studies, Denis Melyantsov, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to talk to the Minsk tone in the same way as it used to.
"The fact that Kathryn Ashton met the Tet-a-tet with Lukashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to be defrosted," he said, "the fire."
This iceberg has a hidden part: the preparation for a break-up by the Belarusian authorities began well before November Maydan in Kyiv, in the summer of 2013.
“The results have also been achieved with the EU – the successful negotiations on the simplification of the visa regime and readmission, the dialogues on modernization – the Fire interviewer, and international security talks have been held with the US.
The States even lifted some of the sanctions.
With regard to the Ukrainian events, they themselves, and the reactions of the leaders of Belarus to them, have only encouraged the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure denied the joining of Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militia in Donbassa with all its severity, did not have a dispute with Moscow.
Minsk has not withdrawn from the Customs Union, nor from the CSTO, and the Russian airbase is stationed in Baranovic.
Brussels and Washington have seen a balanced view of the Ukrainian issue in Minsk, and have been appreciated by the Belarusian experts.
As the Lukashenko movement to political diversification proves to be successful, it will be clear how often Minsk will be able to host EU+TC meetings in the near future.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Kathryn Ashton was not able to respond quickly to questions about what Brussels expects from the new format.
The Spokesman Ashton Maya Cosiancic just said "Fire" that the issue of war and peace was not a priority.
It was also reported that Kazakhstan could be the next place to meet on the Ukrainian issue with the first persons in the new format.
A drop of degnet for Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he confessed to being so, and he was personally asked by the EU.
At the final briefing, however, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties do not object to the fact that Minsk remains a central venue for the meetings, both in the format of Russia-OSCE-Ukraine and at the level of Heads of State and high-level representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” has become a fully handcuffed European leader who is helping to solve the global problem.
Best friend of a European farmer
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Trade and Energy Commissions, led to the conclusion that the main theme of the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbassa, but the economy.
In fact, the meeting ' s calendar of future gas negotiations and to address the concerns of the TC countries under the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU is more ambitious than a peace declaration without a date or number.
The trade commissioner, Carl De Gücht, nevertheless pointed out that the EU representatives “came to Minsk to find a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, not vice versa”.
In the economy, however, the crisis in Ukraine also seems to be working for Belarus.
Its effects, and above all, the West-Russia sanctions, give Minsk, who is still experiencing the sanctions pressure, the long-awaited space for maneuver.
According to Mises, head of the Centre for Research, an ex-nominator for the President of Belarus, Jaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are keenly interested in the capacity of Belarus to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation, bypassing the sanctions.
In doing so, supply schemes have been put forward, for which Vladimir Putin at the summit shattered Minsk.
"The initiators of these schemes," underlined Romanchuk "the Fire", are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and these schemes have now been destroyed.
The Russian business is in dire need of some way to rebuild it, even through the mediation of the Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is the fact that many Ukrainian companies are willing to start production in Belarus of Ukrainian raw material, also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion in export to Russia, and Belarus’s production and trade schemes can now be very needed.
Romanchuk believes that the role of the owner of the EU and the TC is ideal for Lukashenko and for the development of economic links with Europe.
He recalled that the loss of the EU agrarian sector from the Moscow sanctions was estimated at Euro5 to Euro10 billion, and the European Commission was currently offering only Euro125 million to the agriers.
The Belorussian President can invite Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for the Eurofarmers.
This can raise the authority of Lukashenko in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hostages without an initiative
Kathryn Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the irony is that the official Minsk is decoupling its active role in the birth of the TS+EC format, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague has stressed that the new format has been initiated by Kyiv.
“It was your suggestion to come together, without any stumbling block, not from the bay to take a decision, after the signing of the Association Treaty with the EU, to address the situation at that time in Ukraine,” he addressed the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.
The observers, however, interpreted this as an attempt to appease Moscow, which was said to have initially been against the Minsk intermediation, which has greatly increased its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic agency, it is carefully emphasized that Belarus, in organizing the EU-TC interface on its land, has no self-serving purpose, and the ultimate aim of such a format is to create a single economic space in the future, from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
“It is in the spirit of the concepts that, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, are putting forward and advancing the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation,” said “Fire” in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, an agency that has recently carefully chosen the words.
In Moscow, there may be zones of paid entry.
The Government of Moscow is considering the introduction of pay-as-you-go zones as a method to deal with the congestion of central roads, similar to other major cities in the world, handing over to M24.ru, with reference to the Moscow Vice-Maxim Liksutov for transport.
One of the options that has been successful is the fee entry.
It's an expert opinion, we're going to study it, we're going to look at all the negatives and the positives.
To say that some decisions have been made on this matter, not yet,' said the Lixuts.
The mayor stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar to Moscow, was very important to the capital.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the construction of the Central Ring Road, added the Lixuts.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of something that does not have to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there was enough bypass infrastructure, there was no need to have a transit traffic in Moscow,” said the mayor.
Maxim Lixutov also stated that the introduction of the laundered parking lot had significantly unloaded the capital streets.
And, he said, the capital authorities don't plan to stop on what they've done.
On 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergey Sobyanin, participated in a ceremony to mark the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CADA).
Boring Sinable
Frank Miller's and Robert Rodriguez's movie "City of Sins 2: A Woman for Whom it Is to Kill" made a very wrong revolution.
The first "City of Sin" (2005), filmed with minimal but symbolic participation by Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between the movie, the comics, and the literary nuirus.
The sequel is also in its own way a revolution: in the sense that it breaks the fundamental to modern thinking chain of "thesis-anti-thesis-synthesis" (assuming the tease of the universe of nuar and the antithesis of the cosmos of comics).
From now on, it should read "thesis - antithesis - chaos".
"City of Sin 2" is chaotic on both the dramatic and the philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in a bad way.
Yeah, some of the characters are familiar with the first City, though, here, the big man Marv (Mickey Rourke), I remember, finished his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, just in time to pick up - in the role of this national maid - knives and other axes with strangulations.
But the old men are literally pushed out with the elbows of newcomers, as if they'd been in the city from some other movie, the meaning and the story of which the viewers are told not to worry.
So, his own story, shamelessly shattered by the authors at the most interesting place, by the super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Theirs is the lustful-frid Eve Lord (Eva Green) and for something avenging her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this mix-up in which, let's say, Dwight's face is not different from Johnny, all the more so because faces, like other parts of the body, are crushed with inexorable regularity, is not a problem, not even half a problem.
They're not humans, we know it's the archetypes of a nuar: a fatal bitch, a self-confidenced player who's been in the honey trap of a sex detective, a corrupt senator.
Well, when an archetype waltzes with an archetype and an archetype chases, it's not a movie, but an abstract painting.
And it's funny to ask abstract art questions about the logic of a story.
Plus, even in this messy world, there's something permanent.
Fighting whores from the first city still hold a round of defense against the slums of the forces of darkness that besiege them.
And Detective Hartigan's phantom is no, and he's gonna look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem with City of Sin 2 is another.
Frank Miller was good at how a drawer talentedly combined a comic and a noir, and as a director, he turned the picture of how to move the comics to the screen.
Comic and noir are two aggressively opposing "realities."
The modern form of the comic book was born in the late 1920s, when the novels of Dashil Hammet "Blood Harvest" (1929), "The Maltese Falcon" (1930), and "The Glass Key" (1931) created a canon of nuar, then a hard-boiled school.
Or pulp fiction.
The comedians gave Hollywood many dozens of characters: from a seaman, Popey, a spinach eater, giving him rich power, Superman, Batman, and stinging Dick Tracy to Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, and all the other "revenors."
But in any movie on the basis of comics, there was something bad: the characters who were drawn were persistently reluctant to grow up with screen flesh, and they were still pretending to be in the world around them in the will-in-the-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-
Simply put, they were completely devoid of "existence."
Noir, on the other hand, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the wars of the world, the traditional novel - with experiences, character, family scandals, and history - has lost all credibility.
What are the Forsythes, what are Tibo and Rogon-Mccars, what are the Bolkons and Rostovs even thinking after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated into a soap opera, and the criminal - that is, by definition marginal - the novel rose to the level of the Philosophy.
Hammet found out on his own skin what it's like to work as a paramedic on the front.
He was a communist.
As, by the way, was at least close to the company and the genre columns of Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, the directors of Jules Dussen, Joseph Lowes, Edward Dimitrick.
So the noir, the archetype of which they set, is, firstly, rude and cynical, and secondly, purely social.
It's almost an American version of socialism.
The first "City of Sin" was just what was unnatural, but organically combined the comic to the nuar.
For the first time on the screen, the comic was alive, with no shyness in his graphic nature, rather than pretending to be a real movie.
The dream of a corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered the kills, and the senator covered up the monstrous sadist son, was worthy of Hammet's pen.
And the paintings are like the heads cut off by the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the brilliant James Ellroy, the author of the Black Orchid, and the best -- that is, the declarative nausea, the neonoura.
"City of Sins 2" is not even a retreat, but a surrender of Miller-Rodrigues' radical style to the comic book tradition.
It's probably in a lot of ways due to 3D technology.
When you watch the second City of Sin, you feel like you're incarcerated in a glass ball in which the snow falls in a toy cliff.
Most of the time, though, it's not snow, it's blood shrouds, but what's the big difference?
Well, there's nothing to talk about about sociality.
After all, it's only possible when somewhere, somewhere we have sometimes, even on the side of a dirt swamp, but there's a normal world where you can get a girl down the road or say to a sad parent that her ruiner is grounded.
But when there is no place for sin in the city but sin, then sin is no more a sin, but a standard.
Boring as any standard.
Chaos City of Sin 2 is just boring.
For the sake of justice, for the sake of a domestic lease, he gave this unleavened sin a small but pepper.
The titles warn us: The film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In view of the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode of which a man's fingertips break, it gives a hell of a humor.
Hammet would love it.
French socialists have to "shut up and bring France to order," says the key ally of Frassois Holland.
Mr. Valle called for a deeply divided left-wing force to “exemplify the warmth” of the attacking socialist president, whose changes have not been approved by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay with him," he said, voicing applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured him that his Government would not call into question the disputed 35-hour working week in France, despite the inflammatory proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economics, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland begged his fellow members of the Socialist Party to stay “unified” with the Government.
But Christian Tobira, the Minister of Justice, put the sticks in the wheel, coming to a meeting of dissenting members of the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lost their faith in the future”.
Marin Le Pe, the leader of the extreme right-wing national front, expressed contempt for the constant internal conflicts among the socialists, saying that she did not imagine that the new Wall Government would last longer than a few months.
François Hollande is a naked king, but a nude and Prince Manuel Valle, who is forced to gather a new government when the summer has not lasted.
"And the new one won't last the fall or winter," said Mrs. Le Penn to the reporters.
She reiterated her party ' s call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and was ready to run.
The ruling party of France survived the defeat of the March municipal elections, and the extreme right-wing national front was the first in the EU elections in May.
The Sunday Journal du Dimanche poll found that 76 per cent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling apart into several rival factions before the end of Mr. Holland's term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a politician at the University of Cyans Poe, warned that the French would soon lose their patience if the new socialist government failed to correct the economy and record unemployment.
"He doesn't have much time, but public opinion needs to feel that something is changing fast," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation can get worse.
"City Free of Drugs" has no legal action.
The Sverdlovsky Court of Arbitration left the action of the Regional Department of Public Assets Management to the City without Drugs Foundation unaddressed.
The agency intended to recover more than 7 million roubles from the organization as rent for a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the appellant failed to appear in court on two occasions.
Today, the Sverdlovsky Regional Court of Arbitration has left out a claim from the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the Region (IGISO) to the City without Drugs Foundation (one of the founders is the mayor of Yekaterinburg, Eugenius Roysman).
The regional authorities intended to charge the organization with 7.3 million roubles as rent for the building.
Today it has become clear that the appellant failed to appear before the court on two occasions, which is the reason why the decision to refuse the hearing was made.
The reason for the absence from the IOGISO office was not clear, and the head of the legal department, Maxime Titov, did not answer the phone.
No contact was possible with the Fund either.
Let us recall, this is a mansion that has occupied a foundation in the city centre on Belinski Street, 19 on a non-reimbursable basis since 2011.
Such a decision was made by ex-governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Department of Public Property Management of Sverdlovsk Region filed a claim with the Sverdlovsky Court of Arbitration for the eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the action, the agency ordered, through a court of law, the non-concerning of the free use contract to be the home of a memoir.
In the view of the IOGISO Directorate, the agreement did not include substantial leases for the cultural heritage object.
The Sverdlovsky Court of Arbitration dismissed the claim, at which time an appeal was filed with the 17th Court of Arbitration, Permi, which was granted.
The Fund then filed an appeal against the decision in cassation with the same court, which was not upheld, after which the decision was appealed by the Fund to the Supreme Court of Arbitration, but the Court accepted the board.
In 2013, a new lease was entered into, under which the fund again began to pay the rent, as told by the head of the city, Eugenius Roysman.
The rent was set at 300,000 roubles per month.
The previous state administration has donated this building to us, recognizing our anti-drug credit, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration has decided otherwise," he said.
Tatiana Drogojeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the Mayor of Yekaterinburg was asked to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, Father Alexander Kosintsev, a member of Yekaterinburg's Gordum, invited the city's Speaker, Eugenius Roysman, to resign.
The result was a criminal case against a person who was arrested on suspicion of the murder of a pensioner, Oleg Keenev, a member of the mayor ' s parish.
How Eugenia Roysman was found in a criminal case
On 1 July, it was reported that a criminal case had been brought for a “smuggling” (art. 128.1 of the Criminal Code) on the blog of the mayor of Yekaterinburg, Eugenius Roysman.
This was reported to the DG of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Sverdlovsk oblast, where Anna Filatov, the Director of the Defence Law Center, made a statement.
According to her, Mr. Roysman accused her of having blogged her of having been involved in the crimes her ex-husband allegedly committed.
The Mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone will turn into a wallet
In the run-up to 9 September, when Apple is due to present her new designs, the press is getting more and more leaks about what you can expect from the presentation.
Referring to United States media sources, the 6th generation of iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint Apple project and payment systems for Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re/code, Apple can also announce a project with Visa, MasterCard, and American Express at the launch of new products on September 9, which will make the new iPhone 6 mobile wallet function available.
The companies themselves refuse to comment on this matter.
This function makes it possible to pay the shop's cash with a smartphone.
The user will ID the payment by fingerprinting it with the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will have a first-time NFC (near field company) technology that allows for a non-contact payment by means of a smartphone and an appropriate reader on the cashier.
The NFC technology itself will be made available by a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (former Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC function was first introduced in 2004 as part of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors, and more than a hundred other companies that joined the so-called NFC Forum, an association for the promotion of this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with the NFC function, Samsung Nexus S, was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced a Google Wallet system to enable users to tie bank cards to their Google account and to pay with an Android smartphone.
American experts stress, however, that, despite the massive investment of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, American retaliators are still cautious about innovation and are not willing to spend money on the equipment of their shops with such systems.
So now the observers hope that Apple’s entry to this market will still make the retellers quicker and more likely to implement this technology in their outlets.
MFA of France: Paris's position on the delivery to Russia of “Mistralei” has not changed.
The official representative of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Roman Nadal, stated Paris ' unchanging position regarding the delivery to Russia of a type of Mistral helicopter.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Holland) in an interview with Le Monde on 20 August: "Today, the level of the sanctions does not hinder the delivery.
It's a European decision, not a French one," quotes Mr. Nadal "RIA News."
So the representative of the French foreign-policy office responded to a question as to whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would have an impact on the change in the position of Paris to implement the contract.
Read more about the transport of helicopters to Russia in the log "The Fire" "Mistral" is almost ours.
National Security Council of Ukraine: In the past 24 hours, seven soldiers have been killed in the zone of the force operation
The representative of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Andrei Lisenko, reported that seven Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the area of combat in the east of the country and 25 others had been injured in the past 24 hours.
The situation under Iloway is extremely complex.
No details will be made available until the withdrawal operation is completed.
At the end of the operation, information on the losses and the reasons for the situation will be made public.
Those responsible for such a situation will be held responsible,” Mr. Lisenko added, refusing to discuss the situation in more detail under Iloway, where a number of Ukrainian battalions have been encircled.
According to the representative of the SNBO, “every effort is being made to return the soldiers in captivity”, reports ITAR-TASS.
Mr. Lisenko also noted that the Ukrainian military had withdrawn from Luganska Airport in the direction of the locality of Georgievka.
For more information on the situation in eastern Ukraine, see the “OJ” “Arsen Awakov: the first Ukrainian military has left the area of Ilowaysk.
Norwegian Cruise is approaching a $3-billion-dollar deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.NCHL.O, the third-largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stage of negotiating the acquisition of a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc., for about $3 billion, according to people who know the situation.
The deal would have enabled the Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, to have access to cruise vessels of the “Lux” class and to the secured clients of the Prestige Cruises, as it competes with the larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CL.N).
The agreement can be announced this week, the sources on Sunday, warning that the negotiations can still fail.
The owner of the Prestige Cruises, a private investment company, Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of the shares of the Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to stay unnamed, as the negotiations were not open.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, manages 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America, and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 per cent over 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, works under the brands of Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa, and South America.
She announced an income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6% higher than a year earlier.
The 29-billion-dollar cruise industry is expected to have a positive effect in the next years on the growth of the middle class in emerging economies, such as China and India.
The competitors try to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered to the U.S. regulatory authorities for the first public posting of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's main shareholder after an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it is now, in 2000 as a result of merging with a cruise operator belonging to the Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment, and a casino under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thei.
Apollo invested $1 billion in the Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned a share of 28%, Apollo owned a share of 20%, and a private investment company, TPG Capital LP, owned a share of 8% in the company, as reported at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of the cruise passenger flow in North America, according to the records of the first public posting of Prestige Cruises.
Crimea Radio Company can receive 250 million roubles of subsidies
In Minocom, Russia is offering 250 million roubles in 2014 to the State-run radio and radio company Krim.
As can be seen from the draft Mincom-Community Regulation, which is available on a single release portal for the preparation of regulations, it is planned to spend a subvention “to cover the cost of creating the conditions for massive information coverage of the social and economic situation and for the development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.
The money will also be used to buy equipment, repair the roof, and power systems in a news company building founded in 1959, RIA News.
Hong Kong Democratic Movement Activists are blocking the Chinese representative's statement the day after the election decision.
A group of citizens loyal to Peking stood in the vicinity, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the All-China People ' s Congress on Sunday has set a procedure in which only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the Hong Kong Chiefship election in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of a majority of the members of the nominating committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to go to the ballot box and has made the activists of the democratic movement promise again to stop Hong Kong's financial center with the Occupy Central protest.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Peking’s publication of a document describing China’s control over Hong Kong, in June, the activists of the democratic movement held an informal referendum on the elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the business center of the city and set up a sit-in strike.
The Lee briefing is organized by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-China People ' s Congress, Djang Rongshoun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Office of the Feng Wei State Council, were also to address a series of briefings in the course of the day.
Activist students said that they would meet at the Hong Kong Head of Government in the afternoon.
Britain has not mentioned democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to add 400 ha of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
The Israeli authorities have announced their intention to add 400 hectares of land to the West Bank of the Jordan, which is the Palestinian Authority.
According to BBC, the decision to join the land in South Bethley is linked to the desire to retaliate for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli Minister of Defence announced the occupation of the Territory on Sunday and ordered the military to set up an administrative office on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saïb Arikat, the world must hold Israel accountable for “the continued settlement activity in the West Bank of Jordan and East Jerusalem”.
Putin asks Kyiv to start negotiations on the “statehood” of eastern Ukraine.
According to Russian news reports of his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the “statehood” of the segregated region.
His Spokesman, Dmitry Pescove, later made it clear that Putin did not mean to suggest that East-Ukrainian territory under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be reviewed in order to enable the Russian-speaking region to defend its rights and interests.
But Putin’s call to the Kyiv government to start negotiations with the pro-Russia rebels as equal to the obvious strategy that it has followed since the beginning of the bloodbath five months ago: to help the separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossia de facto independence in order to get closer to Russia, not to the West.
In an interview with State-run First Television Channel, Putin denounced the Ukrainian military campaign to return the separatist-held territory to the eastern Donetsk and Lugan oblasts, which was seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently called the occupied territories Novorossia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the fame of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that the peace talks would take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians began campaigning for the parliamentary elections on 26 October, and while Government forces attacked peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, the “plenary of the illusions” reported by ITAR-TASS.
“We must immediately begin meaningful negotiations, not just on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to meet the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Sandov said that Putin’s words about statehood were in the context of a wider autonomy that had been discussed over the months with the leaders in Kyiv in an attempt to quell fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the Eastern Regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not an issue for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of the Spokesman of the Kremlin to correct the “unfaithful interpretation” of Putin’s words has highlighted the decision of the Russian leadership to deal with the separatist uprising in the East in a way other than the open invading of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much harder battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6,5 million people were not Russian, and the polls before the conflict showed wide support for the desire to stay inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international fora would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact by handing over to the Kremlin de facto control of the territory that would link Russia ' s main territory to Crimea.
On the Black Sea, which was joined five months ago, there is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic sea resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov Region and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and lithium factories that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian Army.
The Ukrainian President, Peter Poroshenko, proposed during his inaugural speech on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislators, after new elections, weigh the constitutional amendments to enable the segregated regions to have more control over their finances and language status.
His view of autonomy, however, appears to be very different from that of the Kremlin and separatist rebels who have been accused of arming and instigating Moscow.
Putin’s last call to Kyiv to negotiate with separatist leaders, as with equals, followed the new rebel attacks last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from an earlier peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of the city of Novoazovsk in an attack that the U.S. security forces say is afraid of being the start of a campaign to take over the strategic shoreline to the Crimea itself.
This has led to a massive civil and military effort to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, between the Novoazovsky and the narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
Porokenko called on the European Union Leaders' Meeting in Brussels on Saturday to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which had been independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of non-return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any action; the leaders have called for a draft of more severe sanctions against Russia to be taken in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their position in Ilowaysk after two columns of Russian armoured vehicles and 1,000 military personnel last week entered the Donetsk region to support the separatists in difficulty, Colonel Andrey Lisenko, the press secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, told reporters in Kyiv on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reported to be being held in Ilowaysk as a result of the Russian invasion was traded on Sunday for 10 Russian air marshals captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, told Lisenko on Sunday.
The scandal with the naked picture is grabbing Australian celebrities and Gaby Greco.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust with the hackers, who may have stolen naked photos of his fiancee Gaby Greco and a list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is indignant after a number of frank photographs of naked Jennifer Lawrence got on the Internet as a result of a massive hacking scandal with celebrities.
The hacker in charge of this is said to have about 60 open pictures of the star Lawrence and superstars, including the models of Kate Upton and Kara Delevin, the singer of Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors, Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Stratovsky, and who live in Melbourne, Greco, are also believed to have been stolen as a result of the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who made a proposal to Greco last month, said Confidential, "This is disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is in New York City, is said to have told the news Web site that the hacking attack was "smart" and that the people it was targeting are "thinking they're invaded."
The hacker's supposed to have 30 pictures of Palmer with Scott Speedman's ex-boyfriend, including two frames of her at the bare-boob pool.
Palmer's work in the movie includes "Love and Honor" along with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the movie "Chuck" Stratovsky and the actress from "Prohibited Reception" Browning didn't comment on the stolen photos last night.
A representative of Lawrence said to TMZ, "This is an obscene invasion of privacy."
Acter Seth Rogen expressed his resentment against the hacker by tweeting: "Showing photos stolen from a mobile phone is in fact no different from selling stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, you can't stand to publish stolen photos.
Potential means of stealing pictures of naked celebrities have been discovered.
The massive break-in of star accounts may have been made through the vulnerability of the Find My Phone application.
A potential scenario described The Next Web resource.
A script in Python was published on the Github resource, which was able to pick up the code for the Window My Phone service of Apple.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
The same link of login and Apple ID passphrase is used to access the Apple iCloud Cloud Cloud, from which images of celebrities have been stolen.
The script allowed you to over-recognize the passphrase from Find My Phone.
In this method, all sorts of character combinations are sequentially introduced, starting with the most common passwords.
The script author claimed that there was an unlimited number of passwords in the Find My Phone service.
If the security system is properly organized, after a number of failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account must be locked down and inform the user of an attempt to break in.
Due to vulnerability, users have not received any reports of an attempt to find a password for their account.
The hackers found the Apple ID password and used it to access the iCloud.
According to Hackapp's Twitter user, vulnerability was detected two days ago, on Saturday, and a script program was written for the selection of passwords.
Vulnerability is now closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the Hackapp user, and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability is common to many services, but he noted that he has no proof that this is the kind of vulnerability that was used to access the star account.
It's not me, plz RT
The Prime Minister's Twitter tapes show up again.
Although there is no solid evidence that theft of the photos was used to use vulnerability in Find My Phone, there has been a wave of harmful actions using this service.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that the safety of the cloud had not been compromised, but had not investigated how users had lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Twitter of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, was also hacked.
If the intruders have access to the iCloud as described above, there may also be a password for the head of government account in the microblogging service.
The Next Web resource was not able to get Apple's Vulnerability Comment in Find My Phone.
Poetin granted Russian citizenship to a Ukrainian five-gauge
Russian President Wladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to a well-known Ukrainian sportsman, Anne Buryak.
The relevant decree has been published on the Internet Portal of Legal Information.
At the beginning of this year, the athlete moved to Russia for permanent residence and applied to the Federation of the Modern Five-Federal League for an opportunity to stand for the Russian Federation.
In 2013, she won two phases of the World Cup, won a silver medal at the European Cup in her personal title, and became a world champion in a blended relay, a new type of program in this sport.
It also holds headship in the current season.
Under the rules, she would need a special permission from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee to take up the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her citizenship.
In July, Wladimir Poetin ordered the handing out of a Russian chess player, Catherine Lagno, a native of Lviv, who is a two-time European champion (2005, 2008), a world of blitz (2010), and a fast chess (2014).
As part of Ukraine's women's team, she won the chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the World Cup in Astana (2013), and the European Cup in Warsaw (2013).
SCR closed the investigation into the Tu-204 Vnukova disaster
The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation (RCR) has closed the criminal case for the accident of the TW-204 Airlines Red Wings.
This is reported by the press service of the Department.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the commanding officer of the aircraft and the aircraft engineer.
The forensics found that the cause of the crash was the higher speed of entry, the failure of the crew to implement standard boarding procedures, and the unintentional release of the engines to the higher speeds of the direct traction.
The Tu-204 Airlines Red Wings, on the way to Prague-Moscow, crashed on December 29, 2012, landing at Vnukova Airport in Moscow.
The airship rolled off the runway and set fire.
At the scene of the incident, the captain of the aircraft, the co-pilot and the flight engineer were killed.
The two flight attendants were taken to the health-care facilities, where the injuries subsequently died.
A further three flight attendants who had been hospitalized with serious injuries had been given long-term treatment.
In addition, a driver of a car was seriously injured while on the Kyiv Highway.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
After the accident, the Public Prosecutor's Office conducted a follow-up check on Red Wings, during which a number of violations were detected.
In February 2013, the airline's license was suspended.
The company resumed work in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Emelianenko began to train in SIZO
Alexander Emelianenko, a well-known Russian man of mixed style, who is in SIZO on charges of sexual assault on a maid, has fully recovered from the trauma and has begun to train.
The Chempiot reports it.
In May this year, the Russian Investigative Committee charged Alexander Emelianenko with rape.
The suspect was wanted, and on 9 May he was arrested in Tambowa after an accident that caused a femur fracture.
The Jemelianenko Jr. was arrested until 31 August, and a sentence was handed down on 1 September.
The court, however, was rescheduled, and the investigation insisted on the extension of the period of detention until 30 September.
In the event that the sportsman ' s guilt is proved, he or she faces a prison sentence of up to six years.
What's the power, brother?
"Lenta.ru" remembers the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emelianenko's career.
His last match last year, Emelianenko played with a technical knockout to his compatriot, Dimitri Szkonski.
Alexander is the younger brother of a more prominent fighter, Fedor Emelianenko.
The latter is a four-time world champion in mixed martial arts, a four-time world champion, and a seven-time Russia champion in combat samba.
Anger has proved to be the most universal and functional emotion of man.
An angry expression is biologically universal to humanity, and every organ and group of muscles involved in it is not random, but an additional means of expression of power and threat, and scientists in Australia and the United States have found it.
They spoke about their findings in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and can be found in a press release from the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The anger of the face - the swollen and lowered eyebrows, stretched into a thin line of lips, the swollen nostrils - are the same in all cultures, and make it even blind from birth children who have never seen it, notes the author of the study, Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found out that this emotion has emerged to deal effectively with disputes during a conflict.
The more physical harm one person can do to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his condition, and he is bringing it to the person in question by means of anger.
Researchers have also found another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to get mad and turn to perversion, feel free to impose on others conditions that are not good for them, and choose to use force to resolve conflicts in a peaceful way.
Rejecting from the fact that anger is primarily an “emotion of the trade,” scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of muscles, creating an angry face, should make the angerier individual more powerful and more dangerous in the eyes of the person in question - and thus make him agree to its terms as soon as possible in order to avoid a conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers modelled on the computer persons who had, or were missing, each of the seven elements of an angry person, and showed them to informers.
Although the lower eyebrows or the forward chin alone did not make the face angry, the more powerful man with such traits was recognized by the researchers as unanimously.
Man’s anger, like that of animals, is a threat: an exaggeration of his own power, forcing him to accept and submit.
A man swells his nose and his lips for the same purpose as a frog that inflates, or a baboon who displays his fangs.
“Anger” is “started” by a person's refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes a form that best demonstrates to the other side the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of an angry person is arbitrary, they all say the same thing,” anthropologist John Tuby remarked.
The minicom offered 250 million roubles to Crimea's radio company.
The minicom has proposed 250 million roubles from the federal budget of the autonomous non-profit organization Krim Teleradio Company.
This is referred to in the draft Government Order, prepared by an agency that has been consulted by Lenta.ru.
According to the Explanatory Note to the project, the federal budget grants will be “to cover the cost of creating the conditions for massive information coverage of the social and economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, it is intended to transform the hardware and studio unit, the video wall, the central hardware and the video server.
The acquisition of a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter is also planned.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of the fiber-optic line (VALS) and the repair of the energy system.
Subsidies will be made available within the federal budget for the Minicom.
The State Broadcasting Company Krim was set up in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, over 75 per cent of the peninsula is covered by a television signal.
In 2011, Krim's Teleradio Company was licensed for digital television.
