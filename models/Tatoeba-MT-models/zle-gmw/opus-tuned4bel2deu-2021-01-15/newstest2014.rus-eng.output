In Kineshma and the area, two men committed suicide.
Previously, one of the hangers had already attempted suicide.
On 30 October, about 1 a.m., in Lugovoi, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
He was known to have tried suicide earlier.
What prompted a man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, 11-50, a 41-year-old man in Kineshma died by hanging.
No signs of a violent death have been found, reports the Ministry of Internal Affairs press service “Kineshimsky”.
A black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find the money to fix the splintering highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box carefully installed on the dashboard of your car.
These devices, which track every mile and pass this information to the officials, are at the center of a debatable attempt to modernize the old American motorway finance system by the Washington and state planners.
Normally, the boring arena of motorway planning has spawned an intensive debate and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to give the government the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you pass, and perhaps even where you pass them, and then to use this information in the compilation of tax accounts.
The Tea Party is in shock.
The American Union of Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about private life.
And even though Congress has not yet been able to agree on whether to go on or not, a few states are not going to wait.
They are considering how to move to a system in the next decade in which drivers pay for every mile of the road they pass.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
“This is not a matter on which we may have the right to choose,” said Hasan Hirata, Executive Director of the Southern California Association of Government, who is preparing plans to begin to track the state’s miles pass by every Californian motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's already technology for that.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Fund for the Construction of Highways, which is financed from the taxes that Americans pay on gas stations.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars go more than a gallon a mile.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents a gallon, has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise the tax even by one cent at high gas prices.
“The tax on gas cannot be kept,” said Lee Mannick, an expert in transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
It has recently installed 500 trackers to test the error pay system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long run,” he said.
Nerds call it a wrong user fee.
Not surprisingly, this is an idea that attracts urban liberals, as taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce road loads and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planners in California are looking at this system in the development of strategies to meet the targets set by the state ' s ambitious global warming laws.
But a member of the House of Representatives, Bill Schuester (Republican, Pennsylvania), the Chairman of the Transport Committee of the House, said that he also viewed the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free-marketers at the Reason Foundation are also thrilled to make drivers pay for every mile.
“This is not just a tax to go to a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Politics, Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in 2011 called for Congress to move towards a false payment.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, in which some 10,000 cars would have been involved.
The House of Representatives, however, rejected the proposal because of the fear of rural voters, who often have to go a lot of miles in their daily lives to get to work or to the city.
A few states and cities, however, are on their own.
The state of Oregon has the highest enthusiasm, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the country ' s largest experiment.
These drivers are about to pay the state for a mile instead of a gas tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has been completed.
In New York, it is under consideration.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the involvement of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of the 17 states of the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers had recently been equipped with these devices, the drivers were concerned that the Government was able to track every move.
“Anxiety about the big brother and stuff like this is a big problem, ” said Alauddin Khan, the head of strategy and efficiency management in the Nevada State Department of Transport.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the test was under way, the office of the American Civil Liberties Union in the state of Nevada warned on its website: “It will be easy to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices.
There is no need to build an immense, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to keep records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of the few states in which a hard search for inexpensive technology is under way that would enable state governments to keep track of the miles they pass, but without information on the place and time.
If you can do it, the Khan said, the society will feel more secure.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small, young company in California called True Milage.
Initially, the company was not helping to collect state taxes.
She was seeking to enter the developing market for a type of auto-insurance, in which drivers pay on the basis of a hike.
But the devices it's testing are attracting road designers, because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is periodically downloaded with a modem.
“People will be more prone to do so if you don't track their speed and location,” Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Media.
There have been a number of major errors in some of these state pilots.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do so.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with different options for drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can give up the device completely by deciding instead to pay a fixed fee on the basis of the average number of miles all the people in the state pass.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea to a cautious public, making the device do more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are seeking to develop a tax haven, which will also receive the parking bill, provide “pays as you drive” insurance, and collect a real-time pool of real-time speed data from other drivers who could use to avoid traffic.
“Vehicles will benefit from the benefits that will be offered to them,” states the urban design document.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder if all the talk of wrong pay is just a big distraction.
In the San Francisco Bay City Transport Commission, officials say that Congress could have been very simple to break the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for the Construction of Highways by raising taxes on gas.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be charged to hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles do not use a lot of petrol to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you need to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Law and Public Relations Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their private lives and a lot of other things.
EU is preparing support measures for Ukraine in the event of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a back-up plan to supply Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan, if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
A stand-by loan is being negotiated with the IMF, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations has added that their aim is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
However, in addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million Euros from the EU itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF can overcome long-standing disagreements about the terms of financing.
Nor does the international rating agency S&P, which lowered Ukraine's sovereign rating by one step on Friday, to a "B-" with a "B."
But the EU representatives say that the IMF can be flexible in terms of credit, taking into account Ukraine’s circumstances.
In addition to the country’s financial support plan, the EU has a back-up option to supply Ukraine with gas, the bulk of which is now from Russia.
Maybe it's gonna be a gas from the North Flux or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to the officials, is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia “isolates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that such a method of reverse supply to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and it is likely to result in a reduction in supplies to other regions.
“There are negotiations between EU countries and Ukraine on how to create an enabling environment so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but from other routes,” the source added.
Russia outside the campaign for urban pollution by car
Attempts to address the transport problems of major cities have been in most mega-cities since the second half of the 20th century.
Typically, it was either about remodeling and expanding the highways, or about trying to reduce the demand for, and the number and use of, motor vehicles.
The example of Singapore is well-known, with a strict quota of private car growth and a right to buy it at auctions.
The price may be two to three times the cost of the car.
European cities, including London, have imposed entry fees on the city centre.
In Germany, for example, Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green areas are introduced, where only motor vehicles with a certain eco-class are allowed to enter, also using high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environment Agency, for example, approved a five-year clean air plan in 2012 for a total value of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As the Director of the Transport Pollution Control Department of the Municipal Office for the Environment of Peking Lee Kunscheng said, the main goal of the five-year-old is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35 per cent by 2017, to increase the number of private cars to no more than 6 million (now 5.2 million), and to increase the use of fuel per vehicle by no more than 5%.
According to the agency, transport in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
The main measures of the programme are to limit the use of road transport, as well as to impose additional taxes on motorowners.
Among other things, the city's “green five-year-old” measures include the accelerated transition from the rest of the country to Euro-standards, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and the marking of motor vehicles and fuels, the restriction on the entry of motor vehicles into the city's central part, the ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (in addition, the creation of incentive financial programmes to replace old motors with hybrids or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and public transport), and the development of public transport (includes high-speed).
Peking’s automotive innovation also includes the ban on all private cars to move within the 5th transport ring (the total in the PRC capital is six) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle license plate), as well as the issuance of lottery-based car registration plates (e.g., in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of private car registration permits in Beijing was only one third of the number in 2010).
According to the current government programme “Environment for 2012-2020”, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 it was 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011 “moving sources” accounted for 41 per cent of all urban air pollution.
In Moscow, for example, car emissions are 10 times higher than industrial emissions, while in St. Petersburg, emissions are nine times higher.
The Russian Federation is just beginning to think about the possibility of limiting car regulation on the streets of the city.
The Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the UCE, Mikhail Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road transport are not known to be popular, but can be taken by the public only if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, with two groups that are not sensitive to any regulatory effects - office and personal vehicles, as well as “privileged” users, with a total of at least 200,000 (about 5 per cent of the total of the Moscow fleet).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM centre in St. Petersburg have prepared a study analysing the balance of urban areas between housing, road cover and the number of motor vehicles.
The main findings of the researchers are: the city centre is provided with half the required roads, and most motorists in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking or just on the street.
As a result, it is proposed to build, not parks, but car vaults, rather than to expand the carriageway (to make the streets more friendly for pedestrians) and to limit the use and location of private transport within the area of the security zone of the historical centre (the total area is about 3,122 ha, covering a number of central areas of the city).
Fines for unsanctioned street trade in Vologda will grow up a little bit.
According to the city authorities, an increase in fines would help to clean up Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and trays.
Most street dealers do not pay taxes, the products they make are often not subject to proper health control.
Which means that the health of the wetlands is at risk.
For example, the lower limit of the fine for unauthorized trade will be sixfold from November, from 500 roubles to 3,000 roubles, reports to the press service of the Vologda Authority.
Goldman Sachs warned of the risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of the growing risks to Russia's main driver of fragile economic growth - consumption.
This is, above all, a crisis of non-payment for unsecured consumer loans and massive job cuts.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of that growth.
In recent times, it has been entirely driven by a consumption that is almost non-reducing,” said the Chief Economist of Goldman Sachs for Russia, Clemens Grate, presenting a quarterly report on the Russian economy yesterday.
Now, nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
With an inflation of 6%, it will be able to generate future consumer demand at about the current level, expected in Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russia’s companies is falling, so it is likely that they will focus on optimizing staff costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10 per cent, GDP by just 2 per cent, Mr. Grafé explained.
The companies have been facing a decline in profitability.
If it does not grow up, it can result in dismissals and an increase in unemployment.
Not to raise the wages of the Russian business, commenting by the Chief economist Barclays Capital on Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, Vladimir Pantushin.
Unemployment is close to the historical minimum, and the competition for workers is high.
Employers have to raise their salaries in order to lure out the staff or to keep up the current ones.
Consumption in Russia is also alive with a very rapid increase in the demand for credit.
In Mr. Grafé ' s view, because of the very high rates of consumer loans, this type of credit has no multiplier effect on a country ' s economy.
"The benefits to the economy from the increase in the demand for credit have not been seen, the money is not diverging from the economy, but is returned to the same banks in the form of interest payments," the economist said.
But the problem is, Goldman Sachs is waiting for an increase in unsecured loans.
They're mostly taken by poor people who don't have anything to provide for.
The interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more often," Mr. Graf.
The second threat to the growth of Russia’s economy is, therefore, a possible non-payment crisis for unsecured loans.
The Director of the Banking Institute of the UCE, Vasili Solodkov, is already seeing signs of an emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the low-cost resources available to State banks, have been forced to attract high-percent public funds.
In response, the State Banks went on the path of war and began to lower their lending rates, and the economist continued.
Small credit organizations cannot lend to the same interest, or they will have a negative interest margin.
If the State Banks don't give up dumping, Russia faces a full-blown bank crisis, Vasily Solodkov thinks.
Withdrawal of licenses from a number of banks in recent weeks, the economist has been a harbinger of mass collapse.
“The State Banks themselves will not be able to cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed to deal with the system crisis,” warns the head of the institution.
But the increase in consumption will slow down without a crisis of non-payments, is believed to be in the investment bank, due to the failure to index the salaries of the public and the military, as set out in the current version of the budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, by lower inflation).
But only in part: if the investment does not grow (and the prognosis is not so far - see the certificate), the increase in consumption will still slow down, trusting in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantushin of Barclays Capital has yet to see the prerequisites for implementing pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still a fall in the price of oil," he says.
He estimates that Russia's economy will start to decline at a cost of less than $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the BC is not yet in a position to lower interest rates in the economy.
The paradox is that inflation has fallen, and the banks have begun to raise their stakes.
This may mean that they didn't believe the CB that announced the transition to inflation,' said Clemens to the Count.
The Central Bank ' s interest policy has no effect on market rates, but only on inter-bank lending.
"For the CB, this is a failure of all hope," Clements the Count.
Money from CB auctions is not used by banks to credit the economy, but to manage their liquidity.
As soon as the rate drops, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to be speculative against the ruble.
“Either way, the CB will know that this strategy is not working,” Mr. Grate said, and recalled that the State is planning to put a rouble on “free navigation” by the end of 2015.
But either we have to do it sooner or we have to raise the key rate of the CB (5.5%), he thinks.
According to his assessment, the ruble is now artificially overstretched by 10%.
There's only one way to weaken, the expert concludes.
But if the CB drops a shadow in the financiers of the doubt that the elimination of the monetary corridor is not part of a policy to weaken the ruble, it can bring down the ruble much more.
The second South Ural Congress was held in Chelyabinsk.
The Forum will mark the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood, and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The Congress was attended by delegations from all the towns and districts of the region, representatives of national cultural groups, religious denominations, legislative and executive bodies, a total of some 350.
The forum ' s course is aimed at strengthening inter-ethnic harmony.
We can set an example here, not just for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no differences or differences.
We live in full agreement," states Feofan, the Mitropolitan of Chelyabine and Zlatoustov.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including the promotion of patriotism and cultural cooperation.
As a result of the Congress, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
An exhibition of ethnic and cultural groups in the Chelyabin oblast was opened.
Snowden is ready to "co-operate" with Germany on a U.S. intelligence issue
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence debugger, said he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, could not answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Cristian Strøbele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, who was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, stated: “Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my Government continues to view dissent as treason and is seeking to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that do not give any protection.”
But it is not a crime to tell the truth.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States Government to drop the criminal charges against him.
Allegations brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible."
The relationship between the United States and Germany became strained after the allegations that the NSA was tapping the phone of chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, a member of Parliament who is the head of the intelligence unit, said that if Mr. Snowden could be heard as a witness, “not putting him at risk or ruining his relationship with the United States,” it should be used.
Mr. Ströbele, a member of Parliament from the Party of Green Germany, published his picture with Mr. Snowden on Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to a former NSA contractor's lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not have been able to return to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would need to be assured that he would be there “in safety”, said the MP.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he was faced with a “strong and constant” campaign of persecution, which forced him to leave his home.
But he said he was encouraged by the global response to “his political statements”.
Citizens all over the world, as well as high-level officials — including in the United States — found the uncovering of an all-encompassing system of surveillance to be beneficial to society.
The letter contains an invitation to work with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge for a hand-load
Frontier Airlines plans to charge the passengers up to $100 for carrying a hand-load on their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a hand-held bed and $2 for a coffee or a soda, though their announcement on Wednesday was that the passengers would be able to keep the entire can.
The new payment for the handheld is extended to the bag in the upper baggage compartments, so the small bag under the seat will be free of charge.
Frontier said she'd be charging $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if the travelers would only pay when they landed.
Frontier's representative, Kate O'Malley, said that a $100 bill should make the passengers take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge for it," she said.
Airlines began to charge for the first and second bag in their luggage in 2008.
Passengers who try to avoid these charges fill up as much as they can into a hand-held box in the upper baggage compartments, which often leaves space in those compartments.
Fees are one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection isn't really about making money.
The fact is, the most loyal Frontier clients say it's getting harder to find a place in the upper baggage compartments.
The passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website don't have to pay.
This means that one passenger in a queue on the Frontier flight can get a free bag, while the next passenger in a queue can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the change in the procedures on the website and on the Frontier logs was to ensure that the passengers would know about the collection before they landed.
The new Frontier collection for the handheld will not start in the summer, though the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but the airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of baggage is costing money, and the passengers who need it must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines are charging enough to cover the cost of airfares after years of loss.
Most of them, however, did not refer to charges for hand-deposits.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual deposit fee three years ago, and another Allegiant Air Discounter later followed her example.
The only other airline with such a levy is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said J. Sorensen, a airline consultant who closely monitors the extra charges.
In a report of December 2011, he estimated that the fee for hand-held deposits would cost Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former top manager of Midwest Airlines, was recently on the Spirit flight, and he was curious what he would find at the entrance to the landing when the passengers would run into an unusual pickup of Spirit for a hand-held bag.
"The planting process was the smoothest I've ever seen in my airline career," he said.
I was expecting to see a brush of teeth and a fight at the entrance to the landing.
The plane was full, he said, "and landed fast."
Frontier also follows Spirit for a fee of $2 for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who received soda or juice could keep the entire can and that a cup of coffee would be made available free of charge.
She's still giving out free water.
US Airways for a short period of time tried to charge for the booze in 2008, but refused to do so seven months after the passengers began to complain and no other major airline followed her example.
The Frontier initiative to pay for a hand-deposit when passengers don't buy tickets directly from the airline is the last way to get clients on their website.
Airlines pay online tickets, like Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has given all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, not to go to an online travel agency.
But Frontier went beyond everyone in this field.
In September, it began to give half the bonus miles of a frequent flyer to customers who bought tickets via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut off the bonus number of miles to 25% of the mileage.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip from the Frontier from an online travel agency would make it possible to get 250 miles.
In addition, it is only possible for passengers to choose a place in advance if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a base of loyal clients in her hometown, Denver, but her business is down and is becoming a loser.
The profit fell by 9 per cent, and flight opportunities fell by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by the Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to fix the Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
The NSA blames the "internal error," not the hackers for shutting down the site.
The covert National Security Agency announced on Friday night that the shutdown of their site for a few hours had caused a technical failure, not a hacker, as was alleged on the network.
“NSA.gov was not available for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the planned update,” the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The statements that the shutdown was caused by a distributed attack of the type of "default of service" [DDoS] are wrong.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems recorded that the NSA site was not working for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
A representative of the NSA earlier told ABC News that the agency's inner secret network was “not at all” hacked.
No classified information is in danger, the representative reported.
At least one online group of hackers claimed to be responsible for decommissioning the NSA site with a DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to fill the target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is disabled.
Hackers' tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to infiltrate the inner network of the target system.
Previously, the top-secret NSA, once named "No such agency", has been at the center of public attention in recent months, and has been critically critical, following a series of reports of its extensive surveillance programmes abroad and within the country, all of which are reactions to the NSA's secret files, stolen from the agency and published by a disillusioned former NSA employee, Edward Snowden.
The growing debate around the agency has led to an interpretation that today's incident was the result of the targeted action of the hackers.
Bombardier's profit is falling with the drop in the supply and number of plane orders
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net profits on Thursday, as a result of the reduced number of ordering and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and the problems with contracts in its rail unit.
Bombardier, a company based in Montreal, has also not published any data on the flight tests of its most recent CSeries and has not provided new information on whether the ambitious plans for the commercialization of the aircraft will be completed by the next September.
After the first flight of an experimental model of an aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it only flew three more times, raising questions as to whether the test was on schedule.
The results did not meet the projections and led to a fall of more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst of the National Bank Financial, reduced his estimate on Thursday from "higher-market" to "medium-market" due to the belief that stock growth was limited in the next quarter or two.
“Although the decline in the number of aircraft was generally predictable, we are certainly disillusioned with the performance of the transport department,” said Dorksen in a stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will get new CSeries orders as the flight test program goes on.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will enable it to take a place in the lower-price market, now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype of the aircraft was presented in March and first flew in September after months of delay.
However, CSeries have not so far received a lot of orders, 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight test to test the company's allegations of fuel efficiency and the potential cost-effectiveness of the new ship.
A total of 403 orders and arrangements are now in place with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Officer, Pierre Boduan, was confident that Bombardier would reach his target of 300 solid orders by the time the first plane was launched for commercial use.
On Thursday, managers also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward on the plan.
“The pilot model was not on the ground longer than expected,” Boduan said during a phone conference, adding that ground-testing and software upgrades were planned for the stay of the plane.
All manufacturers plan the tests in different ways.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break on the update, so we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks, and the rest will follow soon, as the company reported.
Still, analysts are skeptical of the claim that the first client will be able to start operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier stated that it was evaluating the date of entry into service and would provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of the flight test, even if it is likely to be in line with Bombardier's internal schedule, supports our view that the entry into service will be carried over to the first quarter of 2015,” said Dorksen.
In the third quarter, which ended September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents a share, from $172 million, or 9 cents a share, last year.
The adjusted return on the share remained at 9 cents.
Gross income fell slightly, from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents on stock and a gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world ' s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it had delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, a decrease from the previous year ' s 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26.
The Air Space Division order portfolio was $32.9 billion as of September 30, with no change since December 31.
“In the area of aeronautical space, the results were in line with our objectives, but the low number of orders received and the general market conditions have become an unpleasant factor,” said Boduan.
The gross income from the aeronautical field fell by 13 per cent, to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train producer, reported that the gross income in this sector rose by almost 11 per cent, to $2.1 billion.
The order portfolio in the transport unit was $32.6 billion as at 30 September, a bit higher than on 31 December.
The revenues of the transport unit have been adversely affected by the problems in the implementation of several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
The stock of Bombardier, who also announced that the head of the Google Corporation, Patrick Peachett, would join the board of directors, fell by 8.5 per cent, to C$4.83, at a bid in mid-Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's nearest competitor, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony is counting on a lower annual profit.
The Japanese electronics producer, Sony, completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, shortened the profit forecast for the current fiscal year.
The Sony results for the period from July to September 2013 were more depressing than expected, due to a drop in demand for TVs, video cameras, and the Japanese company's personal computer.
Sony's television business, which in the second quarter brought the company's first operating profit of 5,2 billion yen in three years, fell again to 9,3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese market for consumer electronics is going through a difficult time, especially due to a decline in the demand for TV.
And while competitors try to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s major rivals, Panasonic, has recently shifted the focus on industrial components, where the company’s sales are growing at a high rate, especially through car systems and clean technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony is expected to earn 1.79 billion yen of operating profit against the expected earlier 230 billion yen.
However, according to Thomson Reuters, the analysts expected that the figure would be much higher to 221 billion yen.
In an effort to emerge from the crisis, Sony expands the food ruler.
In the middle of this month, the sale of smart watches was announced from a Japanese company with a number of fashionable functions, which would make it possible to get rid of the need to get a smart phone out of the pocket 100 times a day.
After Sony lowered the annual profit and profit forecast, the company's shares at the opening of the torogs in Tokyo lost more than 11% in the morning, down to a level of 1668 yen per stock.
The gene of the speech turned out to be a stimulant for the formation of synapses.
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have found a squirrel, which is the result of which Foxp2's “gen of speech” has functioned to stimulate the formation of new neuron links.
The study is published in Science and can be found on the magazine's website.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known genome whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 by the discovery of a family of a number of people who could not speak the right words and sometimes even understood each other.
Scientists found that the Foxp2 gene was disrupted by family members, but how it performed its function was not known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their Foxp2 functions act as a stimulant for the formation of new synapses in the brain-related language.
He's doing this thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was found as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of the 10 genes found by the authors, with Foxp2 being the only source of activity.
What SRPX2 really has to do with the sounding, the scientists have confirmed in an experiment on mouse.
When the animals were artificially lowered, the genes were less likely to yell when they were separated from their mother.
If the gene activity has been regenerated, the frequency of the sound produced has also been restored.
Back in the day, the mouse also showed a connection to the foxp2 itself.
The animals who had been injected with a human copy of the gene at a much lower rate than the normal mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, therefore, the SRPX2 it manages are linked to the pure “mechanical” properties of the formation of sound or more subtle processes.
A cocaine-addictioned lawyer who warned the head of a criminal gang about a police investigation is in prison.
42-year-old Basharat Diett was handing information to Neil Scarborough's criminal authority.
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would be solved.
Sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Liverpool Royal Court.
The prestigious lawyer who told the drug lord about a major police investigation because he was afraid to expose his secret drug addiction was incarcerated for three years.
42-year-old Basharat Diett was handing over to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough secret information on the investigation of his drug-trafficking activities after he was at risk for his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer named Bash, who was called a “cool lawyer,” was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police follow-up operation on Scarborough, whom he had previously represented in a drug-related court.
The officers noticed Scarborough, 32, left three packets of coke at a lawyer's house in Blackburn County, Lancashire, while he was at a bar association dinner with his coworkers.
The investigation revealed that Diett “regulously used” a class A drug after the tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on his credit card.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to obtain illegal information about the arrest of two persons on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four of the suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a major investigation into the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Kambria, Merciside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police seized in a series of raids of heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and over £200,000 in cash.
42-year-old Dietta was handing out information to criminals for fear that his coke addiction would be solved.
Today, at the Liverpool Royal Court of Diett, who works for the Forbes Solicitors legal company in Blackburn, has been dishonored after he has been found guilty in two cases of wilful obstruction of justice after a three-week court in the Liverpool Court of the Crown.
He confessed to possessing cocaine at one of the previous courthouses.
The lawyer was exposed after the police investigating Scarborough found out that he had been on the phone with Diett on a regular basis since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect and found out how he went to Diet's house in Blackburn and put 60% clean drugs in a black golf glove under a lawyer's bin.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough called again with Diet, who was at a dinner at the Iwood Park football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer went home to get the drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court found out that Diett “regulously used” cocaine after the tests found traces of a Class A drug in his hair, wallet, and his credit card.
Dietta was later arrested, but denied the use of coke, said he was talking to a suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a “lawyer's secret”.
At the time of his arrest, Diet took his wallet and tried to take out a number of credit cards, but all of them had been confiscated, and a sample of his hair was taken from him.
In his interview with the police, he said that, in addition to the work place, he had a home office, and his clients went to his house on legal matters.
The court, however, found out that, after important arrests, he had called the major drug traffickers, a number of whom he had previously represented in court to tell us what the detectives knew about them.
In an indictment, Ann White said, "If anyone knows they shouldn't break the law, it's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Dietta is charged with abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, as he has become too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly prove fair, as he was their lawyer.
This, however, has to a large extent outpaced the normal relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He has obstructed the police investigation as much as possible to enable these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Dietta did not honor her profession, but shamed her.
He was too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, to question his interest.
Dietta pleaded not guilty and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and I wanted to pass on to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done so immediately."
But after the session, Chief Officer Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, "Mr. Dietta has become a criminal lawyer as soon as he began to buy drugs from organized crime."
His addiction to cocaine has made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the main criminal gangs who have instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Dietta betrayed this trust and tried to cover up his profession.
Mr. Diet ' s investigation was led by Lancashire ' s unit for particularly dangerous organized crime, which has already been sentenced to three cases of cocaine possession, and now to the obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve fair punishment for the perpetrators.
Let this work serve as a warning to the criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after he pleaded guilty to conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
An additional 35 persons involved in the scam were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Dietta arranged a question-and-answer interview, in which he said that the job of his dream was a lawyer representing a client with a death sentence in America, the ideal companion for him at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and the motivation for his work was inequality.
The Stadium in Jaroslavla was not ready to receive 22,000 viewers, and the police officers who were present at the meeting of the FAC today.
The Tickets programme is, in their view, about double.
During the 1/16 match, the Russian Cup with Spartak was played by only a thousand stewards, with a standard of nine thousand.
Spartakov fans held 2,200 seats, 10 per cent of the stadium's capacity, but, in agreement with the Moscow Club, they sold 5,000 tickets.
This information was read by the head of the KDC, Arthur Grigoriantz.
Americans eavesdropping Japanese high-level officials
On Friday, 1 November, a member of the United States security forces, who preferred not to reveal his name, said that the United States had overheard phone calls from high-level Japanese officials.
The man confirmed that there are a number of auditions in the country of the rising sun.
He noted, however, that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
This, he said, was the case during the Second World War, when those countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite its post-war allied relations with Americans, is a target for intelligence, and CNK has reported.
None of the parties has yet formally commented on this information.
Let's remind you, news about US Special Service surveillance on the chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany last week.
According to German reporters, the NSA has been tapping Merkel's phone for the last 10 years.
The chancellor himself, according to some reports, has taken the news of her wire very painfully.
She said that the allies she considered to be in the U.S.G. and the U.S. for decades, such surveillance of the head of Government was unacceptable.
In the meantime, Edward Snowden stated that he was ready to share details on the wire of Angela Merkel's phone calls with the German prosecutor's office.
The German specifically flew to Moscow to meet an ex-CIA officer.
Bashkiria can put the grain on the market not before the beginning of 2014
The Bashkiria in the course of government procurement intervention can put grain on the market not before the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic, Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not encourage the sale of an intervention fund.
So far, the price on the market is higher, and that's the demand.
"Maybe the grain will be put on the market after New Year's," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that in the current year, crop crops for the 2013 crop amounted to 3.1 million ha, including 1.7 million ha of grain, an increase of 3.3 per cent over the previous year.
For the 2014 harvest, 550,000 ha (an increase of 105,000 ha over 2012).
The area under winter wheat and triticale has been increased, and the face has remained at the same level.
There's no Brothers' Cirkel in the MVD bases, which Leps in the U.S.
The databases of the Russian militants of the Brotherhood, to which Washington listed the singer Gregory Leps, do not appear.
According to Interfax in the Russian Federation's law enforcement agencies, after reports of the U.S. Department of Finance, Gregory Leps, having been placed on the control lists on suspicion of being a member of the Eurasian crime syndicate, all the databases have been checked, but no such group has been found.
The dissemination of this information supports the myth of the so-called “Russia Mafia”, which is said to be operating abroad, is considered by the security forces.
"Even in the very name of the 'brother', there's an element of mystery, a hint of a secret bed.
"It's all very like a PR action," said the agency.
On 31 October, the U.S. Department of Finance announced that he was placed on his watchlists on suspicion of being part of the Israeli criminal syndicate of Arthur Badalian's Brotherhood, Gregory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lilin, Sergei Moskalenko, Jacob Rybalsky and Igor Schlykov.
The individuals on the list are suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontier and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered to be powerful members of criminal groups and who have been on the US sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the United States authorities, Gregory Lepps "is a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontier."
At the producer center of Gregory Lepps, they refused to comment on the United States charges against the singer, calling them "single."
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama ranked the Brotherhood Syndicate as a “substantial transnational organized criminal group” and instructed the MCIF to “sabote and prohibit their global criminal operations.
Putting a man on a blacklist in the U.S. Minfine means blocking his assets in the U.S. and prohibiting business contacts with him by people living in the U.S.
Scandal video hit the police.
The head of Toronto, Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and outright reckless actions, was caught smoking crack.
The Canadian City Police has stated that it has a video record and is ready to open an investigation against the City Chief.
He stated that he would not leave his post, reports to CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of Rob Ford's use of drugs has been posted on the Toronto Police website.
The head of the local law enforcement agencies, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this matter.
The Sheriff said he was not authorized to share the data with the public, but he was vouchable for their existence.
According to Blair, Rob Ford's compromising video was discovered during an anti-drug raid by the guards in the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had previously written about the existence of the video, but there had been no confirmation until recently.
The mayor himself is not commenting on this.
He's just saying it's not his fault, and he's not gonna quit.
The police video is one of the evidence in the case of a 35-year-old friend, Ford Alexander Licey, who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, illegal proceeds, and criminal collusion.
At times, Foxy was the driver of Rob Ford.
The city has long been demanding the resignation of its mayor.
He fought with journalists on a number of occasions, appeared in public in a drunken form, and made racist and sexist statements.
OAO Rostovaeroinvest has recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender by choice of the object's designer.
The sum of the contract at Rostoaeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the UAO Press Service, nine Russian and foreign companies took part in the competition, and the bill is to be prepared and sent to the State Expertise in the spring of 2014.
The winner will have to design a new passenger terminal at the airport, as well as infrastructural facilities, internal roads and elements for the upgrading of the airport complex.
In the first phase of the construction, the inner area of the terminal will be 50,000 square metres, and it will be possible to expand it in the future.
According to the Rostoaeroinvest, the design document will take into account the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to service about 5 million passengers and by 2035, 6 million passengers.
By the time the tender was completed, the architectural concept of the South Aeronautical Complex was defined by the British company Twelve Architectures.
The main terminal project embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Donu and other cities in the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has a major project experience, and the company has designed terminals C and E of Sheremetevo International Airport and a new aeronautical complex at Knivichi International Airport in Vladivostok.
The South International Airport Complex will be built in the Aksai Region of Rostov oblast and will replace the existing Heath Airport, which will be closed down and eventually integrated into urban development.
The start-up of the aeronautical complex is planned for 2014 and the installation of all facilities is scheduled for 2017.
A politician in Turkey has declared a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began the construction of a separation wall in the area of Nusaibin in south-east Turkey.
The locals and representatives of the procuradian party of the MPA have strongly objected to the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaibin Ayshe Gekhan, on the border with Syria, launched a hunger strike protesting against the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syria border, told RIA News in the Peace and Democracy Party Press Service (PMP) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly dispersed the protest demonstrations.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Muammer Güler, first denounced the construction, then stated that the wall was being built to secure the borders.
"Mary Nusaibina Aiche Gekhan, a member of the MMA, has been on a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the wall into a deadly struggle," said the party's press service.
The mayor of the city is of the view that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from one another, and the Kurds have been free to cross the border for half a century.
"This is an inhumane situation with which the Kurds will never agree," quotes Ayshe Gekhan from the party.
According to the press, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is scheduled to take place in Nusaibin on 7 November.
Venezuela will set the rate of exchange for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, the bolivar, in relation to the United States dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on 1 November with a reference to a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to trade the equivalent of ten thousand United States dollars in a year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the Bolivians purchased in the country at the time of their departure.
The specific rate of the bolivar vis-à-vis the dollar will be set at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivarians per dollar.
In the black market, however, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolivarians.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70% of its value.
In September, Venezuela’s inflation rate was almost 50 per cent.
The Minister of Oil and the Vice-President for the Economy, Rafael Ramirez, stated on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to the informal information that the agency has given, Caracas can still decide to lower the rate of the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of containing the prices of products and goods of general consumption, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to a shortage of a number of goods and to the functioning of the black exchange market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported a lack of toilet paper in Venezuela.
The director of the Surrae, Andrei Belmach, said that it was still hard to say how long it would take to find the new Chief Trainer.
The post became vacant after Sergey Shepelev's resignation.
The resignation took place just a few hours ago, so to tell you how long it'll take to find a new trainer, I'm not ready, - it's an ITAR-TASS word for Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're looking at all possible options.
Priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
I don't just want to find a trainer, but a guy who's been working at our club for a few years and getting some results with him.
The Kenyan press is indignant with the provocative media law
“This is a terrible place, and there is reason to ask, ‘What can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judicial system in the future?’
“This law is very strict and punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, manager of the Capital Group, a parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said that the new media court “will always be biased, as it is a continuation of the Government”, and limiting content and advertising would harm Kenya's global economy.
“I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law will in fact enable the government to “smart the media with a dead hold,” while The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “were hit hard, ” and criticized the bill as a “draconian.”
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate mall.
The Kenyan media has angered the authorities by broadcasting surveillance cams, where the troops who have been sent to the scene of the attack are allegedly robbing an expensive shopping center.
The response of the Chief of Police, David Kimayo, was to call two journalists and a media official to be interrogated, even though the call was cancelled following mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists can be fined up to one million, with an additional risk of being “de-listed, ” i.e., being denied formal journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the intruder if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyse most FM radio stations.
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on the so-called “lived blogosphere” of Kenya.
Politicians realize that by making the media shut up, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” writes a journalist at the Nation Mutuma Matthew, characterizing the Kenyan media as a key source of disincentives and balancers in public life.
“The politicians who have been given to themselves will ruin the country and bring us back to the hunt and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted in favour of the lifting of the national wage commission cuts and the reinstatement of their massive wage of about 532,000 shillings per month, one of the highest in the world.
There will be a new cost line in the royalty payments, a contribution to the major maintenance of the house.
By the most approximative calculation, a standard two-room flat will have to be paid from 100 to 400 roubles a month from the new year.
The exact standard will be set by the Government of the region.
But when you paint the stairwell, fix the staircases, or even replace the elevator, it's up to the tenants.
Such a law was approved by members of the Regional Duma.
Wladimir Kharnikov, chairman of the Vorones Regional Duma, said: "In this case, too, it is necessary to put order in order - to prioritize the renovation of houses, to collect funds from the management companies - which we often record in Moscow, in Orenburg, and elsewhere, to put in place State control over the spending of the funds that the residents are collecting for the renovation of multi-family homes."
It's now under State control as well.
A law that protects against crooks has been approved in the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4,500 people have been harmed by dishonest developers.
The problems of the majority have been resolved.
By the way, the new law lays down the rights and responsibilities of all participants in the construction.
Wladimir Kharnikov, president of the Vorones Regional Duma, said, "It is no secret that there has also been an abuse in this field, due to the fact that in the '98 the collaborators fell the same way, and in the 2000s the same collaborators."
People began to make a living on this to cover the loophole, including the adoption of the two laws.
It was decided to build a temporary stay centre for foreign nationals subject to deportation under Voronezh.
The Regional Parliament has adopted such a law not only under the pressure of the Federation.
The problem of illegal migrants in the region is even less.
In the past year, for example, there have been just over 100,000 foreigners on the migration list.
But only one out of every five has formalized a work permit.
Where the rest of us work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Wladimir Kharnikov, president of the Voroje Regional Duma, said, "They have broken the law, but are not criminals."
There's no court, and you have to deport them. You have to keep them somewhere.
The Federation decided to install such places with regional funds.
In the Voronezhsk oblast, this is the Old Olshanka of the Semeluk Region.
Well, lastly, the Regional Parliament has given new benefits to multi-child parents.
First, families with 5 or more children are completely exempt from transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million - but the same is the cost to parents with many children.
Second, and that's the main thing, for those who adopt 3 or more babies, from the new year on, they're going to be awarding housing subsidies.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a cost of 30,000 per metre.
A family, for example, out of 6 people -- dad, mom, baby, and 3rd -- adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the State purchases a total of 108 square meters of housing for 3,300,000 roubles.
For the left bank or the Southwest suburb, it is an acceptable option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage at the center.
Baugertner has been nominated to Uralkalia Board of Directors
The current UAO Board of Directors, Uralkalius, has proposed the candidacy of Director Vladislav Baumgertner, who has been arrested in Minsk, for the new board, on the Russian company's website.
Bamughertner is on the list of 11 persons nominated to the new board of directors.
The list was prepared for the Extraordinary Meeting of Shareholders on 29 November, at which a new board of directors will be selected by a vote.
Baumhertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
When he was arrested in August this year, he was charged with abuse of official authority.
Later, however, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, at a press conference, stated that the charges against Baumgertner were classified as "theft."
The porter of the Naphtechemist, Matt Dalton, refused to comment on the departure of Vladimir Creekunov from the position of mentor of the lower-level.
Golkiper believes that Dmitri Balmin, the Acting Chief Coach, enjoys a lot of authority from the player and will do his job.
Let me remind you, today, the Naphtechemist retiring Creeknov.
Frankly, I don't want to comment on Wladimir Krikunov's dismissal, quotes Dalton RIA "News."
I can only say that Dmitri Balmin will live up to his responsibilities - I have no doubt about that.

U.S. Secretary of State: The intelligence services have sometimes "too far" in data collection.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that the US intelligence agencies sometimes “came too far in collecting data and wire, ” but the politician said that 70 million people in the media had been wired.
I can assure you that innocent people have not been harmed in this process, but there has been an attempt to gather information.
Yes, in some cases this has been too far and unfair.
I admit it, as the President also admits... and we'll make sure it doesn't happen in the future," quotes Secretary of State of the AFP.
Italian employees with seniority are on the way to the young.
Italian unemployment hits the record.
The data published on Wednesday show that 12.5 per cent of the country ' s population is now unemployed.
So bad has not been the case since World War II.
Among young people, the rate is several times higher.
40.4 per cent of the population between the ages of 15 and 24 is unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is early retirement of older workers.
The country ' s largest energy company is already implementing such an experiment, and the laws that have been enacted enable the regional authorities to provide part of the pre-service pension for long-term employees.
Italy, on the other hand, is looking forward to a common problem for Europe with an aging population.
And economists aren't sure that the premature staff rotation will justify itself.
The result of the construction of TPK in Moscow
Every year, the capital authorities promise to set up more and more transport/transit nodes (TPNs).
A total of 255 TPNs are scheduled to be launched by 2020.
The real result of the project was our correspondent.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence was created at the Smolenskaya subway of the Arbatsko-Podron Line.
The inscription was that the transfer unit was in the process of being renovated.
This was all very strange, as no ground transport stops next to Smolenskaya, and it is therefore not possible to move on to it.
To get to the nearest troll bus stop on the Garden Ring, we have to go about 130 meters, including a land pass through the Carmanica alley.
Smolensky's almost finished now.
The flower shop has disappeared, the press stand has been dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance has been replaced with a bar.
That's the whole transport node.
Transport hubs are flat and capital, explaining in the press service of the Department of Transport of the Capital.
There are no capital TIPs yet.
And the flats include the construction of parks, the removal of shopping facilities that hinder the movement of passengers, the creation of small-scale architectural forms, and improvements.
In fact, it is not even the transporters who are involved in flat TIPs, but the professionals from the major maintenance department of the city of Moscow.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex design,” explains the director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the High School of Economics, Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes a roof over the head and a placard are enough to tell us when the transport is arriving.
For example, the Yasenevo subway has recently opened a fully-full, flat-size, transplanted node.
Let's have no curtains, but with interceptive parkings and placards that tell us when the bus is coming.
But in the pursuit of the number, the officials record everything in the TPU.
As early as 2011, the City Hall was planning to build all 151 nodes, 59 of which are capital.
Now there are up to 255 TPNs in the planning for 2020.
Of them, one and a half are promised to turn in this year.
Although the city has a program for the development of TPNs, there are no qualitative criteria, Alexander Morozov, co-chair of City and Transport.
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of the transfer is often reduced.
In the expert ' s view, the criteria should be two: first, a shortening of the time of the transfer, and secondly, comfort.
First of all, it is possible to change the mode of transport without falling out in the rain.
In Moscow, however, TPUs are sometimes the exact opposite.
A bright example of the U.S. subway.
Back in the day, the suburban bus from the Yaroslavski Highway went to the Square in front of the main entrance to the OCE.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Jaroslavka to the street of the Cosmonauts.
Farther from the subway, farther from the monorails, but closer to the homes.
The people didn't want a bus station under the windows at all, and they complained to every possible place.
With the capital TIPs in Moscow, it didn't work out at once.
The first one started building five years ago at the Planetary subway.
The project was meant to be a model.
And indeed, we have a model of how the transfer node, which is remunerated to investors, is transforming into a banal shopping center.
No, there's a bus fare, a curtain to keep the subway out of the rain, and three floors of parking.
True, Chemkin trollbuses No. 202 and No. 203 in Moscow TPU did not have a seat in principle.
They've been taken away as strangers from the subway.
But there's more room for trade.
There are 32 shops alone, and there's almost all of them, from the zoos to the car salon.
Well, what if any of the bus passengers need a new car on the way?
We always have a shopping center when we're building a capital TIP.
The situation has recently reached a logical conclusion when a part of the parking lot has decided to go to the market.
Now, on the third floor of the TPU, Planetary, there is a slaughter trade among the semi-parking spaces.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russia speech, and guards who look at our photographer.
The transfer node has finally become a market.
The thing is, the subway used to have a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, the shopkeepers were spared and put on the interlocking parking lot of the transfer node.
Still, because of high prices, it's always empty.
The funny thing is, the market was demolished to build it... a new flat TP.
That's the rocking.
On the subway "Clue" the range from the subway hall to the bus was 50 meters, says Alexander Morozov.
With the construction of a shopping center, the distance has allegedly increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the mall.
After 22 hours, when it's closed, you have to go around it in the open.
In fact, the designs on the "Planer's" and "Caleuce's" will soon appear to be flowering.
In mid-September, the city and land commission of the city hall approved the planning decisions for the first eight capital TPNs.
Four of them will be 25-story, excluding two or three subterranean latitudes.
The main monster will grow up at the Tusino subway, it'll have 418.7 thousand square meters of land.
The representatives of the railway station directorate of the RZD, who are responsible for the construction of TSPs on the subway, have already told the reporters: future multi-storys will include shops, hotels and apartments.
In doing so, officials say that multi-layer parking is between a third and half of the land area.
Take, for example, the public garages.
Let's say the 258-way garage that was recently built on International Street has an area of 80 to 15 square meters.
So it's gonna take about 80,000 quadrets to park for 2,600 cars at Petrov-Redovskaya.
That's less than a third of the stuff that's going to be built there.
Let one or two floors go to all sorts of bus fare.
There are at least 150,000 square meters of commercial property left.
And this, for a moment, is almost two GUMs.
If the main TIPs at the station and station are built by railroads, the rest of the sites will be developed by metropolitanians.
They also promised that there would be a lot of "functional facilities", including hotels, offices, and even gyms.
By the way, the Moscow Department of Property has recently told the press that a draft order is being drafted to enable investors to apply for a TIP site directly to the officials.
No contests.
Because it's a priority for the city to deal with transport.
The ideal TIP is, for example, the Harward Station in Boston or the Stalin Station in Toronto, I'm sure Alexander Morozov.
There, trollbuses and trams go down to the subway level, and the distance from the subway to the tram is just 50 meters away from the street.
There's no extra trade around.
But the Moscow officials are in the extreme.
Either we don't build anything, or we're gonna break off 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser proposes to treat as extremist the offending of patriotic sentiments.
To legislate for the protection of the patriotic sentiments of citizens against the provocations and insults of “Just Russia”, it is proposed that the insult of patriotic sentiments be treated as extremist activity and that the prison be punished for it for five years.
According to the newspaper Izvestia, such legislative amendments, prepared by Oleg Miheev, Deputy Duma Energy Committee, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the Government for an opinion.
By the patriotic sentiments of the citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person to the country of which he is a national, characterized by love for the country, responsibility for its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Miheev points out, domestic law punishes the abuse of the formal features of State authority, the flag and the stamp.
In the view of the Parliament, however, the protection of Russians, whose feelings may be infected by State symbols and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, is not well developed in Russian law.
As an example, he cites the debate that is unfolding every year on the eve of Victory Day, when some mediamen allow themselves to question the heroic performance of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday, the 9th of May Day, a real bananaly is unfolding every year.
By practising the wits and the "alternative view" of history, some publicists have come to think that, sadly, it is a pity that the cultural Germans have not conquered the wild Soviet Union!
I think this is absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main “spiritual crutch” of the nation,” Oleg Miheev resents.
In addition, according to Miheev, there are far more patriotic people in Russia than there are religious ones, but the law punishes the feelings of the faithful, and the patriotic feelings can be offended with little or no impunity.
In the opinion of the people ' s elector, it is necessary to equalize the offending of patriotic sentiments to extremist activities and to prescribe a corresponding penalty in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provided for the punishment of insulting patriotic sentiments, ranging from a fine of 100,000 to 5 years ' imprisonment.
An Earthquake of 6.6 occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the city of Cokimbo, in central Chile, and is being transmitted to Reuters.
The quake was 10.7 km deep in the ocean and 54 km southwest of the city, as explained on the U.S. Geology Service (USGS) website.
The push was recorded at 8:03 p.m. local time (3:03 p.m. in Moscow on 1 November).
So far, no information has been provided on the victims or the destruction caused by the subsurface.
Remember, Chile is in one of the most seismic areas of the Earth, so earthquakes are not uncommon.
One of the most serious was in 2010.
At that time, an 8.8 - magnitude earthquake and the tsunami that it caused led to the death of more than 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
Chile also experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960, a 9.5 magnetoo was recorded there.
More than 5,000 people have been killed as a result of that natural disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: The Greenspace case will be fairly heard
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, announced on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be dealt with in strict compliance with Russian law.
France can be certain that the case will be handled in a manner consistent with the law, and we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the law," said Dmitri Medvedev at a meeting with the Prime Minister of France, Jean-Marc Ero.
One of the detainees is a French national.
Pierre Pisan, like the rest of the activists, has been charged with hooliganism.
"I have asked if we can expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," quotes Mr. Ero's RIA News.
“Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, and no one can break the law,” Dmitry Medvedev said.
He said that the activities of any entity that was trying to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including the extraction of energy, were dangerous.
He stressed that the facilities were “like a barrel of gunpowder,” and he recalled what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, transmitting the RIA News.
The UN has announced new goals to address poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of challenges to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which had been formulated 12 years ago to address global poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the 2015 MDGs, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio the night before.
They have been included in the final document to be signed by world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit the night before that the time had come to “go ahead of national interests”.
“I am glad that the UN member countries have agreed to launch and take control of the universal goals of sustainable development, the SDGs,” he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will make every effort to use the authority given to me by member countries to translate our vision of the sustainable development goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mosambicans grow as a result of the conflict of powerful people
Under the top-down image of Zamora Machel, the founder President of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scold the message of peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want peace; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sussa, the executive director of an investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt, decorated with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Metropolitan Square of Independence.
Over two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between Government forces and Renamo, one of the most brutal clashes since the truce more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement, backed first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the South African Government of the apartheid era, as part of an effort to destabilize the country ' s independent Government.
After the 1992 truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to a full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and locals nervous.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy, as the discovery of massive gas and coal reserves in the north-west can attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy, and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo Party have been blaming each other for the tension that has been created.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government was the source of the latest clashes by attacking its members in Sofala, the traditional siege of Renamo, on 17 October.
Attacks on former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, reported to the Financial Times, Fernando Mazanga, a representative of Renamo.
The government blames Renamo for instigating a confrontation, blaming the party for attacking the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to dispel the fear of instability.
Hebuza told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday, that Mr. Dhlakama felt like a “successful man” who wanted to use “all that was left of his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government.
Both Frellimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fear has increased following a report that Mazanga has declared Renamo ' s rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Federal Times that he was referring to non-compliance with the agreement by the Freemo Party.
“Our aim is to return to the negotiations, but with all seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease the tension that has been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two powerful men, Gebusa and Dhlakama, who ran into their foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University, and an expert in Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reform, has already declared that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakening movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
Renamo's vote has been falling since 1992, while the new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza, who was due to step down next year, when his second term was over, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace, because he doesn't want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not clear what the capacity of Renamo is, but it has already carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key motorway from the north to the south.
Most of the skirmishes took place in Sofala Province, which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Beira, a port that miners, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of rail tracks for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railroad.
Mazanga was evasive when he was asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
The Renamo Party wanted “to warn the international community that things are not going very well in Mozambique, ” said Mazanga.
Instability has exacerbated government dissatisfaction, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent increase in kidnapping, says Fernando Lima, head of an independent media company, Mediacoop.
“People think that the Government and the President are responsible for the country's future, who should find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultuan, a protester, said that people just wanted to be stable.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelio, they just want peace, they want free access to the roads,” he said.
The "Art Mainstreet" premiere series will be held in Moscow.
A series of "Art Mainstreet" films, where the viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held at the Rollan Film Theater from 1 to 5 November, reports to the RIA "News" with a reference to the project's organizers.
Opens the Art Mainstreet program by the French comedy of the director and actress Reim Kerichi "Paris at any cost."
This is the story of the Maya model in the French capital (Kerichi himself) that is being deported to Morocco due to visa problems.
In addition to the film, Kerichi will also be shown a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duck "Mébius", the melodramatic bioipic by Oliver Hirschbigel "Diana: A Story of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the lead role and the main film of the May Cannes Film Festival "Adele's Life" by Abdelatif Keshish.
The only Russian member of "Art Mainstrim" will be Alexander Veledinsky's film "Geographer of the Globe" won at the "Kinotaur" festival on the basis of the same-name novel by Alexei Ivanov.
The main role, the charming loser-teacher of Victor Servantin, was played by Konstantin Habenski, whose work was also marked by the Kinotaurus award.
Children need to learn myths and legends as “models of a way of life”, says the author.
The Torah accounts could show that “gross power can't beat a sophisticated trick,” and the King Arthur legends show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to teach in school, ” Crossley Holland is in favour of a “silver selection” of age-appropriate texts.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I was in favour of introducing them to the 20-year program.
He added that the “excessive moralization” of authors and teachers “would be of interest” to children, and that the basic ideas were“ converging ” in fascinating history.
Crossley Holland, who translated "Beowulf" from Anglo-Saxon, and also wrote "Norwegian myths" for Penguin and "British folk fairytales", said, "You may have intentions, but you better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps a big difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an adult author who writes for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplistic or lead to a happy end, but it is necessary to have an innate understanding of right and wrong.
And this has to be sublimated; it's out through history, not outright.
Old principle: to show, not to tell.
There's a football fan in Voronego oblast who broke the window in the train station's waiting room.
At 9 p.m. on 29 October, the transport police took off the passenger train two football fans from the Moscow region.
Upon going to the game of the favorite team, the guys on the way got drunk on the train.
Young people have been taken to the on-call section of the Linear Police Station at the Gryazi Station to draw up a report on the administrative offence.
There the fans repented of their anti-social behavior.
The police took the administrative material on them and let go.
Young people bought tickets for the next train, and at the station station, they began to wait for it to arrive.
In the middle of the first night, fans left the train station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broke the front door window in the train station hall with his foot.
A transport police officer and a PSC guard “RZD” roared at the sound of the broken glass.
They managed to apprehend an intruder who was trying to escape the scene.
Members of the South-East LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation are being screened.
There is a question of the initiation of a criminal case, and Sergey Olkhovik, a senior referencer for the information and public relations of the South-East LU of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs on transport.
Vitalia Mutko: Watermelons?
I think we've been back 15 years.
Sport Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the riots on the stands during the "Shinnik" match of the Russian Cup, "Spartake".
I am a supporter of all of this by the organizers of sports events: clubs, leagues, the Russian Federation.
But we can see that they've taken a long stand.
They expect someone from the outside to clean up.
It's a very good position, but it's not exactly the right one.
We have to organize the fans, the clubs should invite their stewards, not let the business go on by themselves.
We have now developed a special government regulation on the rules of conduct in the stadiums.
Once it's in place, we'll get to the bottom of this problem.
But I'm sure I'll invite all the hosts of the football process.
I read an interview with Leonid Feudun.
State, say, quicker the law.
It's like the Bavaria fans in Jaroslavl are here and all set it up.
And we're outsiders.
In fact, it's a terrible thing to see the stand watered out of the fireplace.
And it's in a country that's preparing for the World Cup.
"I feel like we've been back 10-15 years," said Mutko.
Snowden can be interrogated in Russia.
Edward Snowden, an ex-American intelligence officer, is likely not to go outside Russia to testify on the German chancellor's wiretaps, Angela Merkel.
As Interfax said on Friday, a source familiar with the situation can answer questions from the German Attorney General's Office in writing or in the face of Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure out of Russia is virtually non-existent.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by US allies," said the agency.
“In addition, in principle, the Office of the Federal Public Prosecutor could send representatives to the Russian Federation or send written questions to Snowden”, the source added, adding that the issue should be addressed at the inter-State level.
A German Bundestag member, Hans-Cristian Strebele, had earlier reported that Edward Snowden was ready to testify in the case of a wiretap by the German chancellor's United States intelligence services.
Snowden is ready to testify to the German law enforcement authorities, either in Moscow or in Germany.
An ex-CIA officer has made it clear he knows a lot.
Despite the United States NSA blocking all his movements, Snowden is ready to go to Germany.
But for this to happen, all the conditions for his arrival need to be clearly defined,' said Strabel to the Euronews TV channel.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoli Kucheren, commenting on the statement of the source of Interfax, stated that his client could cooperate with the German investigators, but when and how he would decide on his own.
A U.S. citizen, Edward Snowden, who was working for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, ran to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he made public information on the U.S. secret surveillance operations on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport was revoked by the United States authorities, who in absentia charged him with serious charges, and remained in the transit zone of the Sheremetevo Airport until the beginning of August.
On 1 August, Snowden received an application for temporary asylum in Russia for a period of one year and left Sheremetevo on the same day.
Last night, American lawyer Anatoly Kucheren stated that his client was employed by a "large Russian company."
The NSA's surveillance of Angela Merkel last week was reported by the German media.
According to the reporters, the American chancellor's phone calls began in 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly at the United States Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after the publication of the information, stated that the surveillance of Merkel was in violation of the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Ponomarev left Fair Russia.
A member of the State Duma of the Fair Russia Party, a member of its office in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarev, applied to leave a political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he applied to the Party ' s New-Siberian regional office.
According to its statute, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the justices.
We sit down, have some tea...
"For some reason, a lot of people want to see the picture of "Ilya Ponomarev puts a ticket on the table," but there's nothing so epic about it," the MP commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintained a good relationship with the regional essay office.
In the meantime, it is not his intention to give up the mandate of the Member of State Ilya Ponomarev.
He explained that, despite his withdrawal from the party, he remained a member of the faction and was not legally able to leave it.
Reports of Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave the Fair Russia Party appeared on 30 October.
Dimitri Gudkov and Valery Zubov, together with him, were reported to be coming out of the RS, but the latter soon denied the information.
Japan will discuss the issue of a peace treaty with Russia
The head of the Japanese MIDA, Fumio Kissida, met with the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“I would like to have a frank exchange of views on the further development of the political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty”, stated Kisid at a meeting.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that, after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan visited Russia, relations between countries had become warmer and more bilateral.
The Russian Minister, for his part, said that the Russian Federation would meet Japan in dealing with complex political issues, as RIA Newsly writes.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of the disputed northern territories.
In this regard, there are protesting in Tokyo today, demanding the return of the land that has been lost since the Second World War.
The Japanese capital is driven by cars, from which it is said, "Return the North!".
The police don't stop the protesters, they make sure they don't get any more noise.
Ben Greenman: The tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
We can say that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedy in America: almost a century ago, the entertainer Frank Faye, who worked as a conferenceer at the Palace Theatre Theater on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversative way.
Faye's new work has over time been picked up by others, most recently the New York comedy festival.
The festival, created and run by Caroline Hearse, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, celebrates her tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows in small clubs and big theatres.
“Most of these headlines began at the Carolines, and then made more progress, to the point where they're already too famous to be in the club,” Hearse said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performances of Wanda Sykes, Cathy Griffin, and Bill Mara, as well as the "Standup for the Hero", an annual music comedian charities concert for war veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, John Stuart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby will be among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
A number of comedians at the festival this year have become popular in a non-conventional way, such as a show on small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.
Nick Kroll has been renowned for his role in a comedy show on a low-known cable TV channel (known as "Liga" on FXX on Fantasy-Football), and now hosts his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast, both in "Saturday Night Live", and in "Parks and Rest Zones", though it is best known for a series of viral rollers, "Marsel - a shell in boots."
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with their own style (surrealistic pessimistic Anthony Jesselnik, a devious, racially focused Kamau Bell), are the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be an interview of David Steinberg with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but then became a successful film and TV director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the host of a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the center of Manhattan.
“This city is, of course, the central element of all Larry's work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he came here, he would sometimes go out on some street between the two houses and think, "Well, if I don't have any money, maybe I'll live here."
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported to the British Embassy, where Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan is visiting.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British vice-premier Nick Klegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the world energy market, and economic reform in Pakistan.
“The Prime Minister has reported that the dialogue with the Taliban has begun,” states the statement of the Pakistani Embassy in London.
- He said he was hoping for and praying for the dialogue to work according to Pakistan's constitution," the diplomates added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Techrik-e-Taliban Pakistan) are allies to the same-named Afghan movement, but operate independently in the north-west of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the creation of an Islamic State.
The Government of Islamabad had previously tried to start negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement had refused to engage in dialogue.
It stated that it would not negotiate until the authorities took the troops stationed in the Taliban-held areas to the permanent location, and released the arrested Islamists from the prisons.
Nawaz Sharif has come to London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, held a trilateral meeting in London to discuss the prospects for a peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil fell to $96 a barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when alarms about the formation of large stocks overshadowed a message that showed that China’s energy-intensive production sector was on the rise.
The standard United States oil in the December shipment has been 14 cents, and the price was $96.24 a barrel later in the European day in electronic tenders on the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract was 39 cents, which was a 5.8 per cent drop in the October price.
The rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy announced on Wednesday that US reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barrels have been added to the stock.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible upsurge in demand, based on two reports of the Chinese industry that had shown an upsurge in its activity.
This indicates that China’s economic recovery can continue to grow after the growth rate in the third quarter has risen to 7.8 per cent after a 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Brint's oil, a reference type of international oil, also used by US oil refineries, has increased by 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel at the London Intercontinental Exchange.
Chief Coach "Colorado" Patrick Roux, explaining the decision to release a holchiper, Seman Varlamov, from the first minutes of the Friday match with Dallas, expressed his confidence that the last night behind the bar had not shaken his confidence in the Russian, handing over from Dallas a subpoena to "SE" by Natalia Schmeleva.
And what do we expect to do, he said to Rua after the morning roll, "Lavin."
Of course, what happened to us all is a matter of concern, but we are sure of it, and we feel that it will be good for him to get out on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his normal level.
So you're pretty sure the situation didn't have any effect on the porter's condition?
We'll see today.
No doubt, our players will support Varley by helping him to keep the gate, as was the case in the previous match of this season.
The main thing is, no one on the team is gonna draw any conclusions until the court has sorted out the situation.
In Siberia, you don't have to be vegan: warm tomatoes don't replace soup.
Why vegetarianism is not appropriate for life in Siberia was found by RIA News.
People who have completely abandoned animal food should not live in Siberia.
They can't take the winter here without a health loss, and no warm tomatoes are compensating for it, and the vegan dietologists and doctors who were interviewed on the eve of Vegan Day think of it.
Drinking butter with liters
Strict vegetarianism, when not only meat and fish are abandoned, but also milk, honey, eggs become a fashionable way of life.
But dietologists believe that in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia it is at least unhelpful to keep to such strict dietary standards.
A complete renunciation of animal products is bad.
Animal proteins contain non-essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate by plantation.
You have to have at least the milk or the eggs in your diet,' the dietist Marina of God is sure.
It gives an example of a fish containing an irreplaceable Omega-3 fatty acid.
The richest of herb oil is linen.
"To need it in the quantity needed for man, you have to have a liter of water," says a dietist.
Doctors believe that Siberians need to pay special attention to the diet in winter.
Vegetarianism is particularly in question this season.
In the context of our reality, there is a high standard of food.
You need an elevated calorie to keep you warm.
"If a man restricts himself to animal products, he is therefore inexpensive to this calorie," says a specialist.
That's what the dietist, Olga Pity, agrees.
She adds that the fruits and vegetables are not the way to go.
It is better for a person to eat mainly products that are grown in the region or where he was born.
The genetic code is geared to better absorbing and digesting these products.
And in winter, people don't want to ate a cucumber, but a hot soup or something like that," the doctor explains his position.
According to her, from what vegans can eat, a variety of grains, grains, beans, local vegetables, apples left in winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But it's definitely not enough for a full diet.
According to a gastroenterologist, Claudius Arifoulina, an anthrax has a sufficient level of vitamins in his system from mid-August to mid-September.
The full transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural environment, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees in 24 hours and the snow lies in May, is incomprehensible.
The body needs energy to live, and this is, above all, the fat," the medic states.
Doctors point out that vegetarianism is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building material, including amino acid.
And by sticking to vegetarianism, we give them inferior.
Pregnant women also need an increased content of protein, vitamins and micronutrients on the menu.
"The vegans don't get it," I'm sure.
Arithulina says that an adult is free to choose anything, "to play the toys he wants."
He's got a body, a skeleton, an organ.
Still, children need to be fully fed.
If his parents take away any micronutrients or amino acids by choosing for him what he's gonna eat, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of some kind of substance to develop the brain, the sight, the bones will no longer be restored tomorrow," she says.
All the health-care professionals interviewed agree on the low quality of winter-growing in greenhouses and incubators and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in the greenhouses contains less of the micronutrients we need than (growing) in the open.
"The quality of the food is not the same," says God.
Arifulina also points out that incoming and warmer vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
At times, the willingness of the producers to harvest more crops is detrimental to quality.
"The apples don't get brown on the cut, the cucumbers are fast-gold and molten, the tomatoes are tasteless and neuromatic," the paramedics give examples, adding that they are likely to be filled with an excess of fertiliser.
And they don't sell vitamins, they become cellular.
The Siberian Institute of Physics and Technology Institute of Agrarian Problems, a candidate for arable sciences, Vera Petruk, disagrees with this.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all the standards and requirements in the greenhouses, it is possible to grow full-fashioned vegetables.
If they try to get more from a square metre, of course, they will get more water and feed the plants with mineral fertilisers.
For example, when too many nitric fertilizers grow fast, they are big, but watery and watery,” she explains, adding that the quality issue is primarily a matter of the producer's conscience.
The court suspended the enforcement of the “stop-and-search” practice in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the appellate court of the Federal District suspended the execution of a court order requiring a change in the stop-and-search program of the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeal stated that the execution of the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended pending the outcome of the city ' s appeal.
In August, the judge ruled that the city was in violation of the Constitution in the way in which he carried out the programme of street detention and interrogation.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and the order for corrective action, including an order to appoint a controller to help the Police Department to change the way it works and the related training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a hearing of the parties on the motion to stay the case.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge needed to be recused because she had violated the U.S. Code of Conduct and had not considered it necessary to avoid being biased, in part due to a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court ' s criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unreasonably resorting to blacks and Latin Americans on the stop-and-search program.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee the major changes, which include policy, training and control reforms, and has also decided to launch a pilot program to test TV-enabled cameras in police stations where most of the arrests take place.
In August, New York decided to put an end to the practice of storing names and addresses of people whose cases had been closed after a police check.
The City ' s appeal is due to take place after 14 March 2014.
The “stop and search” tactics have been criticized by a large number of civil rights lawyers.
Stop-search has been in practice for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has dramatically increased under the administration of independent mayor Michael Blumberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 in 2011, most of whom are black and Latin American.
In 2004, four people, all members of national minorities, filed a collective lawsuit.
Proponents of the “stop-and-search” program in the New York Department of Police say that these changes will put an end to bad practices, form a more robust and effective police service, and can have an impact on how other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that changes will lower the spirit of the police, not the level of crime, lead to unnecessary spending of money, and will not address the more global problem of the complex police environment by reducing the number of officers by a few thousand in the last decade.
The judge noted that she was not putting an end to the practice of “stop-and-search”, which was in line with the Constitution, but was altering the way the New York Police stopped people.
In the area of the Tretikov Gallery, a pedestrian zone was opened
A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretetsovsky Gallery and occupies a section two kilometres from the subway station Novokuzny to the Bolt Square.
All along, street torches, florists, berries, urns and toilets, deaf fences and illegal advertising have been set up.
In addition to the Klimensky and Lavrussian alleys, which were already pedestrians, five streets, the Ordinsky dead end, the Great and Small Talmachev alley, the Kadashev Bay and the Bottom Square, have been closed for the car.
Traffic on the streets of Maroseika and Petrovka is not restricted.
In the section of Friday Street, from the Lobby of the Novokoznyskaya station to the Clemente alley, the conditions for pedestrians have been created without demolishing the traffic and cutting the carriageway, and they pass newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone, the Tretrichov Gallery, the Temple of the Martyr of Clement of the Pope, Museums, Libraries, Monuments, and Other Celebrities were found.
The Tver Pass, the alleys of the alleys and the Kuznetsk Bridge were previously completely pedestrians.
The big Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, decided to shut down for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used a phone break-in to check a private message.
The former editor of the News of the World, Andy Coulson, allegedly used "the phone, the watch, and the stand-up" in an attempt to prove false information about Charles Clarke, who was then the Minister of the Interior.
The Prosecutor, King Andrew Edies, informed the court of Old Bayley that in May 2005 the News of the World had received unreliable news that Clark was meeting with her “attractive special adviser” Hannah Polby.
The paper ordered private detective Glenn Mulkeyre to break into Paulby's voice mail and watch her outside to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages, ” the court heard.
“The prosecution is of the view that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of man to stand next to someone's house, hoping to catch someone by surprise, he is the man who likes to offer history to people to see what they say,” Mr. Edies said.
He said the News of the World used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second one, the follow-up, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone break-in?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
The rumours of Clark's novel first drew the attention of News of the World when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Polby said, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A tape of voice messages from her phone at least three times was removed from the house of Mulkeyre in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer, in which Miss Polby and her sister appeared as "Projects".
During her period of surveillance, Mrs. Polby ' s grandmother and grandpa received anonymous phone calls requesting information about her, said Mr. Edies.
At this time, former Chief Reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weatherrap were watching Mrs. Polby's movements.
After leaving her a voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story we're planning to publish tomorrow, which I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edies said that Coulson's involvement in the story was in the same way as with other powerful people, such as the former Minister of the Interior, David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blankett about an affair with a married woman while he himself met with a co-defendant, Rebecca Brooks, who was at the time married.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with other people to break up their phones from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulkyre, Turlbeck, and Weatherrape have confessed to hacking their phones.
Snowden says he's ready to talk to the German authorities about the wiretap case.
An ex-CIA officer, Edward Snowden, expresses his willingness to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany, and transmits the RIA News.
A letter from a former CIA official to the German authorities at a meeting with the press in Berlin on Friday was presented by a Bundestag member, Hans-Cristian Strebele, through which Snowden sent a message to the German authorities.
Strebel met Snowden the previous day in Moscow.
Fire on Tver Street affected four people
As a result of the fire in a collector in the center of Moscow, on Tver Street, four passers-by were injured.
According to Interfax, with reference to a source in the emergency services, one of the victims has been hospitalized.
According to the source, passers-by was affected during a fire in a smoked underground crossing.
According to RIA News, with reference to the head of the Metropolitan Department of Fuel and Energy, Pavel Livinsky, all the houses on Tver Street are now fully re-energized.
The fire in the heat collector near home 15 on Tver Street took place on the evening of 31 October.
There was a strong smoke out of the rainy sewer hatches, and a smoke was created in the underground crossing at the Army shop.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tver Street were decommissioned.
At 9:45 a.m. Moscow time, the fire was eliminated.
US cuts in the food allowance for the poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday, US finances for food stamps, known as “Foodsteps, ” have been cut off, as the state program is running out.
A family of four will now be allocated 36 dollars a month less than they used to be, say officials.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in FY2012, an average of $133 per person per month was paid.
Food aid spending in the United States has increased to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14% of Americans have been relying on free food aid, which has been given by foodstamps, which has been named since the previous years, when they have been in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis erupted, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
The Republicans in Congress, however, call for further cuts in the funds allocated to the programme, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need it more.
The owners of food shops all over America are concerned that cuts will result in lower consumer spending.
US Congressmen continue to argue about how much more government funding can be cut.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform free of charge.
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platform on the PC free of charge.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game was made available on the "Battle.net" section of the classic Blizzard game.
However, some gamers note that only users whose accounts are part of the American service can now download it.
The game is also not available for Russian users.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on the PC is no different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained the same.
The Blackthorne player, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and bright kingdom.
One day, the dark ruler of Sarlake decided to kill the bright king of Vlaros and become the single ruler of the planet.
The main player in the game is Vlaros' son, Kyle, who was saved from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight Sarlack's co-workers and to protect the planet's inhabitants from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game to be released after its renaming as Blizzard Entertainment.
It was previously called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was a publisher of Interplay.
There will be new machines in the Moscow subway.
But it's not for money to sell tickets to the passengers, it's for sit-ups.
One trip of 30 roubles will cost a potential passenger 30 sit-downs.
The number of sit-downs will be computed using modern technology, and it reports ITAR-TASS with a reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first machine will be installed at the Expo Station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of the new tickets, the President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Zhukov, and the Olympic champions Alexei Nemov, and Helena Jelena Jelena, will be welcome.
National Security Agency confessions reinforce corporate paranoia with regard to State surveillance
On a warm day late in August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
According to an instruction from the Federal Office for the Defence of the Constitution (BfV), the German Homeland Intelligence Service, his mission was to take a picture of the roof of the United States Mission Building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media say that BfV was hoping to find the antennes of listening devices, and this action led to negotiations between the US and the German Department of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of US National Intelligence, again assured in September that the US was not using foreign intelligence to steal the business secrets of foreign companies in the interest of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or their profitability.
But since Edward Snowden, a contractual employee who has become a denouncer, has begun to publish his treasure of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company leaders are no longer sure if the director can be put to his word.
Reports of the United States National Security Agency following the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gaining access to data from US cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised the paranoia of the state-led companies to new heights.
The last drop was the news that the phone of chancellor Angela Merkel had been tapped for about 10 years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be a target, then, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made it clear that there is intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I think it's possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
“Germany has to wake up, ” says Oliver Grun, president of the BITMI association, representing Germany’s small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the US now faces almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the EY Consulting Agency.
All of Mr. Snowden's disclosures, however, still do not show that the US was handing over the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked some information technology and Internet capabilities, and felt that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Some in the German Parliament say we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of a German software company for SAP.
If there is a need for a strong European IT industry, we should not have let it die more than 20 years ago.
All are subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
All except the IT industry.
Still, the scope and technical development of US spy agencies, which have come to be known by Snowden’s revelations, has been a shock to some companies that used to think that China was the highest risk of surveillance.
A big shift is taking place in cloud technology, where European company leaders have become more aware of the fact that the data in the US are in the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-Americans have no plans to use the US-based Cloud Provider after exposing the American program for the brain-analysis of Prism data.
Jim Snape, one of SAP's executives, said, "We see that consumers are asking a new question that didn't come up a year ago, namely, where my data is stored, and if you can guarantee that they will physically stay in this jurisdiction."
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are just confirmation of what they already knew: the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore they need to be protected at all costs.
What is happening in economic espionage is not surprising.
It's always been.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed much in the current debate,” says Kurt Bok, Chief Executive Officer of the BASF chemical company.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are spying on them, too, because it is in our national interest to protect our business.
Corporate leaders don't usually like to brag about the response they've taken, as it can give the opponent an advantage.
The idea of taking a free drive at the exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room has long been taken into consideration.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the board of the Audi Automotive Company, says that it has been a standard practice for many years to pick up mobile phones before board meetings so that they can't be used as an eavesdropping device.
The Federal Office for the Defence of the German Constitution recommends that company leaders consider the use of simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign trips due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
Still, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to entry and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leading the world market in their particular niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” warns the BfV report.
The US warns its own companies of economic espionage from other countries.
The US National Intelligence Report in February put France, together with Russia and Israel, in a second set of violators who are hacking for economic intelligence after China, claims The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst. ”
Bernard Scarcini, a former head of the DCI, said in an interview this month: “Services know very well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a young man from Georgia who was killed by a "false accident" think their son was killed
The parents of a young man from Georgia, whose body was found inside a rolled-up sports mat in his high school gym, believe that their son was killed, said the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertical mat sitting in the back of his high school sports hall.
Investigators of the Loundes County Sheriff's Department have concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old boy has challenged it.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was killed,” said FoxNews.com, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he was dead as the Sheriff says.
“They think it's against the logic, the laws of physics, and common sense,” Cramp said.
They think it's a cover to protect a man or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a dead-body bag," he said.
American counsel Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that a number of key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll look at all the facts, no matter where they go.
My aim is to find out the truth.
“I am of the view that there are sufficient grounds” for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsies revealed that Johnson died as a result of "position asphyxiation."
But the second postmortem, according to Moore, revealed another cause of death.
“There are a few issues to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to request a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to do it.
The Loundes County Sheriff's Office was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to publish all the videos of the surveillance cameras that the investigators had been looking at.
The teenager’s parents said that they were hoping that the videos contained the key to finding out how he died.
"Spartacus": For the information on the persons who hung up the fascist symbol
The official website of the "Spartacusa" features a statement by the Moscow Club about the appearance of a fascist flag on the stand in Jaroslavla.
"On 30 October, at the Shinnik Cup game, "Spartacus" was shown by unknown provoctors at the Yaroslavla Stadium by fascist symbolism.
We call on all who have reliable information on the perpetrators of this criminal offence to request it.
"The reward is guaranteed," states the statement.
We're looking for fans who hung a fascist flag in Jaroslavla.
Remember, in the 1/16 Finals of the Russian Shinnik Cup, "Spartacus" was interrupted on several occasions due to the riots on the stand.
A fascist symbol was also displayed in the Spartaka fans' sector.
In the form of a punishment, Spartacus can spend about three games without an audience.
The Committee will meet on Friday.
If you have any information on who put this symbol in and out, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations to schools on allergicity to children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is on the rise.
Now one of the 20 kids in the United States is allergic to food.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the incidence of food allergies among children rose by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The manual provides information to schools on how to raise the awareness of teachers and staff of food allergies among children and how to help in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline reserves — most commonly used for injections by the EpiPen medical syringe — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The state legislature has recently amended the regulations to enable schools to make adrenaline stocks with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "It's like something sticks in my language," "it's like I have a hair in my language," or it's "the language is pinching."
Parents of intersex children can choose an “undefined gender”
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born with an intermediate sex organ.
Newborns will no longer be required to be male or female.
The new law does not require parents to refer to any gender of such children by allowing parents to refer to gender as “undefined” or “unidentified” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the Act was to relieve the pressure on parents who might have to decide to have sex-adapted babies and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex man, according to BBC, said many years later, "I am not a man or a woman."
I'm going to be a doctor-created piece with bruising and scars.
About one of the 2,000 children born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological states that are diagnosed with “sexual abuse”, a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonades (eachers or seedlings) or unusually developed external sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
Gender identity is still under-explored, but most experts in the United States say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and to attribute it to it than to wait for and track the child's psychological and physical development before the operation, if any.
The New York Psychiater, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said that the new German law “was sounding like a good idea. ”
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening infractions that require prompt intervention, but most children do not,” he said.
You can assign a gender without an operation, and then see how a person develops.
The knowledge of how a child develops a gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a riddle about why people can be gay.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as being different from transgender or transgender, as their condition is not gender-specific, but biological, which is not exclusively male or female, but is typical of both, either at the same time or not.
These characteristics can be found in secondary sexual traits, such as muscular mass, hair-cover distribution, breasts, and body-building; primary sex traits, such as reproductive organs and genitals; or in chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the field of employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and preconceived crimes.
Boys with gender disabilities now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to place male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Walby, became the world's first man to be “no-female” by putting aside the right to a life-long “undefined” sexual status in court.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use a third mark in addition to M and F to X, i.e. intersexual.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still at odds, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators, a prominent Catholic country, signed a petition for the removal of “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also disagreed with the German law, saying that “in a situation where the world is in a new state, where gender is the subject of choice, and sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization.
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also told the Baby Zone Web site that she would have preferred to have the children set up at birth.
“It is hard enough to have a child without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child,” she said to the parent’s website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genitals have been called hermaphrodite, by the name of a beautiful Greek god who had the characteristics of both genders.
And just a decade ago, the health community viewed gender as a sheet that can be erased and then re-stamped.
But now, a lot of people are challenging the ethical basis for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how a child will view the gender he or she has when he or she grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called an "emergency mental incident," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist; you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to deal with intermediate genitals was put forward by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who thought gender was easy to change.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and argued that the signals of the environment, including the social — the way the parents raise a child — interact with the genes and hormones of the child, determining whether a man would think of himself as a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories were in question.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged during a negligent circumcision, to castrate the child completely, also removing his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
“Mani presented the incident as a successful example of a transition, but it was not,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that at the moment, some doctors are still "applying this model."
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these gender-change operations declared themselves to be “dissatisfied with the result.
This was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but an intermediate type genitals.
Doctors couldn't pinpoint whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that he would never be able to live a man's "full life."
So, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's outer genital organ and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He began to have female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I was not a girl," he said to ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was assigned to the Vaginaplastics.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he needed medical records.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sex disorder, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for the normal development of genitals.
After learning the truth, he again became a man, getting shots of testosterone and removing his breasts.
The operation made it sterile.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexuality.
But Ann Temar-Mattis, the executive director of the California Juridical Association of Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “creates to label and stigma. ”
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will prompt parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an undefined sex,” she said.
We're afraid it'll help us get involved.
We think it's best to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Temar Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law, as it “lets adults make a choice in favour of the third sex”.
“People must be able to make their own decisions about formal gender,” she says.
The German law refers to her being embezzled at birth.
It's a fight in which little kids don't have to go at this point.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baraz, a mammologian in Pittsburgh, who has a sexually disabled daughter who assists hundreds of others in a support group, said that the German law would “help” both parents and children.
Barac's daughter, Cathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual dysfunction called the "androgen insensitivity Syndrome".
Since her androgen receptors are not working correctly, Cathy has developed a feminine character.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Cathy is married to the University of Pennsylvania and is interning for child psychiatry.
Although barren, she hopes to be a parent through adoption or gestational surrogate.
“The law gives the parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own, ” said Baraz.
It gives them time to do some analysis and to sort out the situation, as well as a period of time before they write "male" or "female."
In such a case, you are in good health — raising a child, loving a child.
You have a wonderful kid, and you're enjoying it.
We don't need to have a quick, irreversible operation.
“This allows children to participate in the decision and to address the anxiety that drives their parents because they don't feel like they're doing the right thing,” she said.
After all, the child will decide which sex he or she is more comfortable with, and that is excellent.
This gives children the opportunity to make a decision on their own.
The Chicago Gateman, Nikolai Habiboulin, stressed, he understands he should play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two meetings of the Hawks, Habibulin first skipped six pucks from "Tampa Bay", and then four from "Ottawa", and in the second game, it was replaced after the fourth missed puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games, I failed to do so, - quotes CSNChicago from Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in the exercise. I think I should look at it like a game and try to get a better result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings you've had.
There are a few small things I need to improve, but I feel pretty good in my training.
But for some reason, after a few heads, things turn into some sort of snow coma.
Maybe I need to relax a bit.
The gatekeepers - I don't think I'm the only one - always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I don't like it.
It doesn't matter what's going on in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself to keep the puck out.
It's good to have my co-clubmates back up, but it's pretty simple, I have to play better.
Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to do them a lot better.
But it happened.
I have to put it aside.
I'm just gonna try to win the next game better.
The Altaya bus was overturned.
In the Rubtsov district of the Altai region, a bus was overturned.
As a result of the accident, 13 people were reported to the Regional Office of the MES, according to the updated data.
The regional law enforcement authorities had previously reported 10 victims.
According to the agency, the accident occurred about 9 a.m. local time on the Newvonicolaevka - Vishnevka Road, 1 km from Novonicolyovka.
The bus from Rubtsovska to Všnevka contained 12 passengers and a driver, all of whom suffered injuries of varying severity and were hospitalized.
Eleven of the victims have been taken to City Hospital No. 1 Rubtsovska, and two have been hospitalized at the RBK Rubtsovska.
Medvedev expects SSJ-100 to be flown to Europe.
Russia expects that, once the Latin American and Asian markets are in place, Superjet 100 will also be flown to Europe.
“We expect that in total we will receive such arrangements for more than 170 copies of such a type of aircraft,” quotes Interfax, the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, who he spoke at a press conference with French Premier Jean-Marc Ero.
The head of the Russian Government noted that there was a strong cooperation with French counterparts, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some of the financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once the plane is strengthened in Latin America and Asia and the Pacific, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he'll come to France one day," stressed the Russian Premier.
SSJ-100 is a plane built by the company “Citizen Dry Flights” in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is developed on the basis of modern technology and offers high standards of quality and comfort in a segment of 100 passenger spaces.
Dnipropetrovskaya's energy has begun a unique program to save... the nests of hawks.
In the old age, to bring the stork to the court, the peasants on a high stake set up a wheel from the cart, and the heavy nest was good on it.
They've been out for a long time, so the hawks have loved the poles of the power lines, and the wires are wired, so that the aystic hut is secure.
Anja’s grandmother, whose home in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrikovsky district has been home for 20 years, began to see the nest settle in spite of all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new rags on top, and the lower layer is already in between the wires, and it's about to fall.
Of course, it's a pity for a family of hawks who nested in the courtyard every year, brought out and fed three or four chicks in the summer, but don't want to be left without light.
As soon as the birds left for the warmest part, Anja’s grandmother called the Czarician RPP, which owns the support.
I didn't even expect it to react so fast.
When our experts arrived in Ivanovka, they were astonished that the nest was still in place, told the Dneproblergo technical director of DTEC, Sergey Berezovsky.
On the wires, which were, in fact, inside the nest, weighing 150 to 200 kilograms, the corrosive effect began.
At any time, the birds could have been electrocuted.
And the locals risked getting out of the light because of the wires.
So the linear monteurs have started an operation to save the nest, not for the first time in our practice.
Ornithologists from Dnipropetrov National University have been able to help, and have developed a nest transfer scheme.
They also conducted training for district network staff.
A well-known ornithologist, Alexander Ponomarenko, consulted energy at all stages of the nest reconstruction.
For starters, it was estimated that there are more than 50 atypical “stays” in the area.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms like a vortex have been boiled up.
The base was spiked with owl branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
In the view of the experts, it is sufficient to put the old branches as a basis for the birds to know the nest and return to it.
Afterwards, the storks will build their own dwelling.
A month ago, the first nest was rebuilt in the village of Sandshank of the Neunoskovsky Region.
A new iron concrete pillar was installed next to the electric expanse, and a platform was placed on it with an old, coated nest.
The whole operation cost nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day, the same house was held in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrikovsky district on the outskirts of Ani’s grandmother.
This is where the platform was anchored, just up above the wires.
Ornithologists believe that the cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in spring that their apartment has been renovated.
By the end of the year, four more nests are expected to be rebuilt in the Pocrátsk and Czarican districts of Dnipropetrovczyk.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others kill them ruthlessly.
The other day, the whole area was overrun by a sad news: in the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostolic Region, on the day of the launch of the pheasant hunt, poachers shot a swan family in the local pond for fun.
The noble birds were not afraid of the people; the locals fed them and didn't offend them.
When the villagers, after hearing the shots, ran to the pond, four beautiful swans were already lying dead on the water.
The Apostolic Police Department is now investigating who shot the birds in the Red Book.
"Russian March" is getting more popular.
On 4 November, on the Day of National Unity, Moscow will be held in agreement with the City Hall's “Russian March”.
According to the Levada Center poll, the support for the Russian Marchs is on the rise, with 40% of the citizens approving it to varying degrees.
According to the Levada Center, 40 per cent of the citizens in all respects approve of the “Russian Marches”, of which 11 per cent are definitely positive and 29 per cent are “promptly positive”.
The popularity of the “Russian Marches” has been growing gradually, with only 14 per cent of Russians welcoming it in 2006, and more than twice the number of citizens (28 per cent) in December 2010.
"Surely negative" to "Russian Marches" is only 7% Russians, and "shortly negative" is 19%.
A further 35% were not able to form an opinion on this action.
This year, the Moscow City Hall agreed on a “Russian March” of up to 15,000 people in Lublino, which was reported today by the head of the security department of the capital, Alexei Majorov.
This nationalist action has been held every year on the Day of National Unity since 2005.
In response to a question from the sociologists, "Have you ever heard of Russia's “Russian Marches” on 4 November under slogans to defend the rights of the Russians in Russia?", three quarters (75%) of the citizens responded in the negative.
Now, only one in five Russians (20%) know about this action.
Notably, in December 2010, almost a third of the citizens (31 per cent) heard about the “Russian Marchs”.
Three years ago, on 11 December, a natural nationalist rally was held in Manego Square, which grew into a massive riot.
Levada Center also asked the Russian what holiday was being celebrated on 4 November.
In two years, the number of people who know the right answer (the National Unity Day) rose from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15 per cent of the citizens are attending the festival.
About the same (17%) will celebrate November 7th day of the October Revolution.
Most of the citizens (62 per cent) are not going to celebrate any of these festivals.
How Moscow City Hall agreed on a "Russian March" in Lublino
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to a “Russian March” on 4 November in Ljublino.
This was reported by the leader of the "Russian" association, the organizer of the Dmitry Demushkin March.
In addition to the Ljublino Walk on the Day of National Unity, there will be a rally and a rock concert of the Colorado group, also in agreement with the authorities.
How did "Russian March 2012" go?
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, the nationalists marched from the Yakiman River to the Central House of the Artist, where the rally was held.
The organizers estimated the number of participants to be 20,000, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs quoted the number of 6,000.
Message: Obama's pre-electoral headquarters was considering the release of Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton.
According to The New York Times, the closest advisers to President Barack Obama had in secret considered the possibility of replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
This discovery is the brightest sensation of all of Mark Halperin's and John Heilemann's 2012 campaign, "The Stats Double: The Game Changed 2012".
The Times has received a copy of the forthcoming book on Thursday evening and has reported that the president's immediate assistants have done “scaling research in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011” to see if Byden's exclusion can help raise the waning hope for Obama's re-election.
According to political columnist The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by senior officials of the electoral headquarters and the White House, the former head of the White House, Bill Daley, to assess the effect on the vote of the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton as vice-president.
The possible replacement was a secret, well-guarded one in Chicago's electoral headquarters and the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers, including Daley, the former head of Obama's pre-elective headquarters, Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisors, David Axelrod and David Pluff, knew that the replacement was under consideration.
The Book of Stucks Doubles states that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden, despite their “intimate personal relationship, ” but he eventually refused to do so, when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list would not “make Obama’s chances much better. ”
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering the possibility of replacing Byden Clinton.
“I have been very active in looking at a lot of things, and it was one of them,” said Daley to the paper.
You have to remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh, my God, what do we do?"
Although Daley described the study as a “necessary test,” Martin told CNN representative Anderson Cooper that the election headquarters had invested a lot in the study of whether this step would bring dividends to the vote.
“Electoral headquarters don't spend such sums of money on polls and focus groups if they don't take things seriously,” said Martin in the AK 360 program.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was exploring the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss knew about a possible altercation.
Although Daley said he didn't think the president was "informed" of a possible replacement, the former head of administration admitted that Obama "maybe" knew.
Martin added that the Pits Doubled did not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political scanning had reached Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the study on the possibility of excluding Biden from the electoral roll.
"Perhaps," Martin replied.
You want a glow in the dark of ice cream?
The British entrepreneur created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream with a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came up with this idea by reading a scientific article on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate a glowing squirrel.
The ice cream reacts with the language of the person who eats it, raising the pH level in the squirrel and making it glow.
Chris says that since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the "Life me, I'm delicious," says, "this is an incredible thing, but it's still at the very initial stage, in terms of production, so you'll get about 2 g of a substance for £200."
The squirrel we're using in ice cream reacts to your language with a neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up a squirrel, it'll raise the pH level, and the ice cream will start glowing.
We've been testing it for the last few months, and it seemed like it would be perfect to introduce it to Halloween, because it has such a wonderful glowing effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the fluorescent jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So every balloon is about £140 for me.
But it tastes pretty good.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef, and taste of cosmic gold.
But its next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop an unseen ice cream."
That's by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals, which make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish, synthetized by Chinese scientists.
Trainer Avangard, Wladimir Chebaturkin, in connection with the preparation of his team for the regular KHL match against Salawat, noted that Omichi carried out a thorough analysis of the magnetic Metalurg.
The expert stressed that the Avantgarde needed to focus on the defense game.
We've been watching a video game against the Magnegorian Metalurg, and we've got the official website of the "Avangarde" of Chebaturkin's word.
- Missed a lot of pucks, not a very nice moment.
Missed because of their mistakes, because of failure to play.
We knew the adversary had performers.
Statistically, they've had five hits on the move-- three pucks hit us.
It's a very good implementation.
Have these errors been taken into account in preparing for today's game?
The guys and I are doing every game, talking after the game, getting ready for a new rival.
The key is to make sure the installation is run.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against the Metalurg.
The job was played, and the score was 2:0.
Missed a goal in the locker room, and in the third period, they began to make a mistake.
In view of the hard way the game was going to work, it didn't make any sense to get the defenses involved.
You have to back off with the whole team.
Now Avantgard has a long home-made series, the match goes on in a day-- the team's got a lot of fatigue?
All commands are under the same conditions.
The main thing now is to do your moments and to do the game.
hockey is an emotional game, and if you do the setup, it's not that hard to deal with.
Due to the new rules introduced by the Russian Customs, hundreds of furs have been in line for almost a week at the border with Russia.
Today, Donut officials have promised to provide the drivers with potable water and to install biota.
Hundreds of furs have been hoarded at border points when entering Russia.
This situation was due to the change in the customs regulations for the handling of goods.
The Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that the turn is being made by the Russian side, which has not given any advance warning of any new developments.
As of 28 October, the Russian Customs authorities have introduced additional measures to guarantee the delivery of the goods, as reported by the Deputy Chief of Eastern Customs, Vladimir Denisov.
The new model is applied in countries that have acceded to the convention on international transport.
Passports are in a high mode.
The correspondent of FACTOV has been to the border and has been in contact with truckers who have been held hostage.
The cost of a road-to-road shop at the “Novoazovsk” pass is on the rise every day, as is the queue from the fur.
Cars stand in a number of rows, stretching about two kilometers.
The Novoazovsk - Veselo-Vosenka Customs Terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine on the international motorway.
From this point of view, the goods are sent to the Stavropolsk province of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Armenia.
On Sunday, until midnight, the rules were still in place, complaining about a trucker named Alexei Golovanev (in a photo) who is transporting a cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan through Russia and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
By the new rules, to cross the border, I need an extra package of documents and a payment for the cargo insurance.
The sum depends on the value of the goods and the distance to which they are taken.
Minimum insurance is between 4.5 and 5,000 roubles (about 1100 and 1,300 hryvnias).
Those who are not far (say, Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo of up to $50,000 pay about 15,000 roubles (3,800 hryvnias) and pass.
And the rest of us are stuck, 'cause no one has that big money with them!
Can you imagine, if a driver is transporting a shipment of just four thousand dollars, but to Moscow, he needs 90,000 roubles (almost 23,000 hryvnias) to pay for the transit!
The conditions for survival at the border, no, are grieving by the truckers who have been set up to eat in front of their cars.
In border shops and cafes, it's always expensive, but we've never met a price like this!
The sellers focused and quickly rolled them up: 15 hriven is a bar, 7 hriven is a cup of coffee, and 25 hriven is a dish of soup.
And there's one place to go.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the toilet.
No washing, no shave...
I can stay out of my car for a week, my wife has ready for me on the way.
I'll spend a week comforting myself with another trucker, Victor Scotarenko.
But will my car be in line in a week?
Why do you have a liter and a half of water?
There's 11 and 15 hryvnias.
What, is the bottle crystal or is the water solid on the silver?
We have a cafe, not a shop.
Take it while you've got something, the shop girl's on the table.
After media coverage began, the plight of Ukrainian drivers was brought to the attention of the authorities in the region.
The leadership of the Ambrosia and Novoas Regional Government has been instructed to provide drinking water to all who stand in line on the Ukraine-Russia border, as stated by the Acting Chairman of the Donetsk Oblast of Sergey Dergunov.
Ambulance units are now on the outposts.
Biotools will also be installed for human convenience.
According to the official, the queue problem will be resolved in the coming days.
As at 31 October, 32 and 68 vehicles had been parked at the international “Uspenka” and “Novoazovsk” checkpoints, according to the Donetsk press office.
The “acts” will follow up on the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian President
Russia intends to carry out informational provocations against senior Lithuanians and Eastern Partnership countries, a statement made by BNS in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
Information on this is available on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is about to “converse” the President of Lithuania, Dalj Gribauskait, and to publish the falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian Gosarchy, which refer to the facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the Department for the Analysis of Public Processes of the Office of the President of Russia on Inter-Regional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is in charge of the preparation of an information attack.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umenkov, who has visited Lithuania on a number of occasions and participated in the Congress of the Lithuanian People ' s Party.
Also allegedly involved in the operation is a member of the Department of V. Smirnov.
Smirnov, according to the intelligence service, went to Lithuania on a regular basis until the end of 2012 under cover of scientific work and was in contact with local politicians, political scientists and the media.
Smirnov is now barred from entering the country.
On the eve of the day, the President of Lithuania, Gribauskait, declared that he was aware of the computer that was preparing for it.
In her view, the main reason was the success of Lithuania's presidency of the Council of the European Union and the “country's desire for energy independence”.
The Lithuanian leader has previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities on more than one occasion.
So she claimed that in the Kremlin, Lithuania was “not respectful enough”.
In addition, Gribauskait accused the head of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, of putting “single claims” to Lithuania.
Recall, in September Rosmestnadzor suspended the import of the Lithuanian "milk" to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the product was not in line with health-epidemiology standards.
At that time, the leader of Lithuania stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, the Government should prepare an application to the WTO.
In the United States, the headmaster shot at teenagers.
The headmasters of one of the American high schools have literally made the teenagers desperate.
The man, he said, had to take the gun and start shooting.
The incident took place in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, young bullies left the man's house with toilet paper.
As a result, the principal of the school opened fire on young people, resulting in a number of injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the bullies were not on the property of the director, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released on bail at $125,000.
Let's say the shooting of civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened a fire in downtown Ridgecrest in the U.S. state of California right on the street.
The perpetrator then took two random passers-by hostages, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Previously, in Newtown Elementary School, Connecticut, there was a shooting.
Adam's mom was a schoolteacher.
Shooting at American school: a 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident took place on 31 January at an American school, this time in Anlante, Georgia.
Two people, a 14-year-old student and an educator, were injured.

2013 Halloween in number
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late to bed, and put up a dressing party for our neighborhood.
Now I'm more of a scumbag.
I haven't wanted to give out candy in my apartment in the last two years, and I'm probably not gonna do it this year.
But the statistics show that I'm a white crow in the area of Halloween.
According to the National Federation of Retail Trade, most Americans — that is, 158 million — will be celebrating Halloween this year and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and decorations.
The only thing I expect every Halloween is a trend.
The National Federation of Retail Trade predicts that it will cost $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent on costumes.
This year at the top of fashion are sexual insufferable objects.
Women no longer have to be sex workers; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we're going to see a lot of zombies thanks to Walking Dead, and I'm sure that a group of Daft Punk cosmonauts will get into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the suits that most of the time look for are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
There's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed up our dogs last year, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the National Federation of Retail Trade, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet suits.
That means a lot of funny hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't give up.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, candy candy, Milk Dods candy, Twizzlers gums, and Clark Bar candy candy.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is excellent news for 41 million candy kids who are ready to conquer our neighborhoods.
In fact, we're gonna buy, and -- we're not gonna lie to ourselves -- we're gonna eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is candy in the form of maize grains; yet, according to the National Association of Caederians, it's almost 35 million quid for Halloween.
This is about nine billion individual grain grains.
This is a riddle I still have to figure out.
There's nothing more to Halloween than a house of ghosts.
They have fabulous titles, such as "Awe behind the walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "War and Cry," and "The House of Shock."
In fact, according to American Hunters, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America that generate about $500 million of income, as well as the amazing pictures you almost put down, which your friend posted on Facebook, and you can't get rid of, and then the guy you like to see this picture and leave a comment like, "Cool look on your face."
And we'll end up talking about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting Jack's lightlight is like decorating the Christmas tree, what we've been doing since we were kids.
Luckily for us, the fashion for a baby in a pumpkin only started last year thanks to the Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out these pumpkins, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack's lightlight, slowly drying up on your porch, is probably coming from Illinois, who's raised 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want a more complex task, go to Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to cut out some of their 2032 pound pumpkin.
The Estonian DOD site was reinstated after an attack by Ukrainian hackers.
The site of the Estonian Ministry of Defence was reinstated after the morning cyberattack, reporting to the press service of the Department.
According to the Vice-Chancellor of the Department of Defence for Information and Administration, Timmar Petercope, it was a primitive attack, and the site was overloaded with a lot of requests.
Our techs have set things up fast, and so far the site has been re-engineered.
"The damage to the Ministry is minimal," said Petershop to Postimees.
According to Petercope, it's too early to talk about who set up the attack.
“We will certainly look at the cause of the incident and draw conclusions from it, but it is not possible to prevent such incidents,” he admitted.
On November 1, the Anonymous Akraine group posted an online message that confirmed a hacking attack on the Estonian Defence Department's website and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the leadership of NATO to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be NATO's servants.
The Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of the NATO member countries.
Ukraine does not need the NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia.
Ukraine should not be a slave to anyone.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
"Hands off Ukraine," says Anonymous.
The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine has previously reported that the company of the Marines of the Teodosian separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marines will take part in the NATO response force command and command exercises, Steadfast Jazz-2013.
A number of schools and a hospital had to be shut down due to the violence of unclean power.
Four schools in South Matabeleland, Zimbabwe, had to be shut down because of the attack... Goblins.
As the local elder said, the children were in a state of panic, and it was not possible to continue the classes.
The story of goblins may sound like an invention of a child for a European, but in Africa this is a very serious argument for school shutting down.
Adults are also fearful of unclean power.
In the summer, for example, the hospital in Zimbabwe was shut down because the medical staff was also attacked by goblins.
Land Rover has been announced.
Inside are race seats and 6-point seat belts, as well as an internal communication system.
In addition, modernised brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support, and car inter-activities can be obtained.
Drew Bauler, manager of Bowler Motorsport, said, "The Rollers who go to Bowler have changed."
Some of them are not experienced riders, but people who are looking for anxieties, adventures, and access to world-class events.
We are happy to offer such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try the different disciplines of the Rally in Britain and abroad, as well as to prepare the participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the Rally Road.
We've been very enjoying the Defender Callenge car -- it's going to be a really exciting championship.
In addition, Defender Callenge has one day in February to train and test, as well as an opportunity to take part in events in the North African and Middle East desert.
The Russian militants are not aware of the Brotherhood Group - New News
INTERFAX.RU writes about this with a reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"After media reports of the US Department of Finance putting Leps on the watchlists on suspicion of belonging to the Euro-Arab criminal syndicate 'Brotherhood', we looked at all the databases, but no such group was found," said the agency.
In his view, the dissemination of this information helped to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which was allegedly operating abroad.
As previously stated, the U.S. Department of Finance recently published a list of alleged members of the Brotherhood's criminal group on its website.
Among them was the Russian singer Gregory Leps.
It's on the list as "Greesha," it was posted the previous day.
They match the data of a popular Russian performer.
The exact name is Gregory Lepsevride, the creative pseudonym, the place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other names.
Two Russians, an Israeli national, an Uzbek national, and another from the former USSR, whose nationality is unknown.
In the United States, Gregory Lepps, who lives on the island of Phuket, is sure to have been transporting money for the bandits on their order.
This report includes a picture of the singer and all his relevant data.
In fact, Leps actually recently bought a house on Phuket.
The agency indicated that it intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
Putting a man on a blacklist in the U.S. Department of Public Information means blocking his assets in the U.S. and prohibiting business contacts with him by people living in the United States.
Her assistant, Leps Maya Serikov, said that no notices had been given to the singer: "It's hard to answer the question if it's the Gregory that everyone is talking about now in connection with the US scandal."
All Leps knows is the media.
He has not been formally notified, although I do not know if they do exist in such cases.
"And, of course, this is all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other, surprisingly and unexpectedly," she said to RIA News.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live on Phuket, but according to the U.S. Department, he does have a home on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps was currently on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him on a flight to the city of Blavetschensk.
Runnin' out on the field in the Shinnik game.
Some details of the identity of the fan who ran out on the field during the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup between the Jaroslav Shinnik and the Moscow Spartak.
According to the head of the CDC of the Russian Federation, Arthur Grigorianz, referring to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, is a Moscow fan.
He's currently in custody.
"In addition, Gregoriant spoke of how the fan was able to break through the field: "It turns out that this one, we call it a viewer, went to an ambulance, accompanied by two viewers, citing heart problems.
He went to the E.R. - that was confirmed to us by the E.R.
And then he pushed two escorts off and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the East and South Tribune to the corner of the East and North Tribune.
He ran all over the field.
The stewards are responsible for this.
Prior to the entry into force of the Sports Act, it's a steward's area of action - the police can't interfere with what's on the field.
He ran up to the stand, climbed over the East stand.
And at that time, there was an upheaval on the East Tribune and on the runways," said the head of the KDC.
Let us recall that by a decision of the KDC, the Moscow "Spartak" will hold the upcoming match of the 15th round of the Russian championship against the "Locomotive" and "Zenita" and will pay a fine of 600,000 roubles.
The fire brigades were called to save the missing puppy, who was stuck 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous leap in his career.
Coker-spaniel Ruby ran off after she hit a small car accident.
Three days later, she was caught up in a career and was spotted by a man walking a dog.
The firemen came down on a rope on a steep slope to save the dog from the imminent death.
The puppy was lucky to escape after the fire brigades had been called to pick it up and deliver it to a safe place, after it was somehow stuck at a height of 50 feet on the dangerous slope of the elevation.
A nine-month-old coker-spaniel, Ruby, ran off after she was in a car accident on Sunday afternoon, and spent three days alone before she was rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her hosts, 25-year-old Scott Alderson, and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were in Flappit's career in Denholm, West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They hunted for their missing dog and posted messages on social media sites after she ran off to the quarry after a small accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a star dog boy spotted Ruby, who was 50 feet in the quarry.
A technical rescue unit from the Clekhiton fire station hastened to the scene, went down on the ropes to save Ruby, and used a transporter to lift her up the slope.
Andy Clayton, a rescue officer, said, "She was in a dangerous position."
It was right in the middle of a high slope, 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move her muscle during the rescue, she's completely frozen.
But now she's okay.
Then she ate biscuits.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
The rescue officer, Peter Lau, said, "Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued."
There was a chance she might have been in a very serious trauma or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up, and it was found that she was all right, with the exception of dehydration and dehydration.
Mrs. Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "Keep watching the rescue was terrible."
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when it was in our hands again.
The vet said that if she had been out and blacked out, she'd probably have fallen.
The firemen were great.
It was very brave - what they did.
We're so grateful, and each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson from Kitley added: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
The firemen were stunning.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't flirt with Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio show this week, a pop star stated that she was a back-up singer for the 2004 Jagger song Old Habits die Hard.
Perry said she was having dinner with a rocker-veteran, and she said, "He was flirting with me when I was 18.
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of 70-year-old Jagger said that he “kategorily denies that he ever hit Cathy Perry.
The representative added: “Maybe she confuses him with someone else”.
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones Tour this year.
Her new album, Prism, debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Breaking up with Europe gives the Scots a choice.
One more day, another fear of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free-moving zone as a condition for EU membership.
The history of passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along Adrian's shaft is on the way.
True, Strathclyde has pointed to the possible economic benefits of freer movements in the rest of Europe, though, what is predictable, this has not appeared in the headlines.
Nor has anyone indicated that EU member countries spend a lot of time rotating their formal rules in the way they please.
Since Scotland is no longer part of the Schengen zone, continued non-compliance will be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for what he really wanted from the Scots.
So it's a non-negotiable story.
And it's so old that it's become a fossil: for the first time, I've heard "the duck" that "independence means passport control," at least 40 years ago.
Still, there's an interesting moment lost in the old fairytale.
Why does an independent Scotland have to follow European orders?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the big post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With Eurocrisis, the Europe project is officially dead.
All over the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or for the euro to be abolished as a single currency are gaining power.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Party “Alternative for Germany”, founded this year alone, emerged out of nowhere and won almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially pushing the Free Demokrats (an analogy of our Liberal Demokrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to the federal European plan.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis was a turning point.
The austerity measures introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency, have led many to think that the “Europe” project has gone too far.
The euro crisis is not due to the fact that national governments are working in excess of fiscal deficits — it was only fair for Greece.
In fact, the euro system has blocked its members at the exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters, which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, Southern Europe is at a predetermined disadvantage in terms of production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only way to save us is to cut our wages and public spending, which Berlin is actively supporting.
Behind the current problems of the budget and the currency is the deeper problem of Europe’s productive capacity.
As a result of a set of green energy measures introduced by Brussels, a cipher that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the United States.
It's a paralysing negative price environment, as we've seen in Granjmouth.
No wage freeze in the world will stop the crushing victory of US cheap slate gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, there is a revolt, especially in France, once by the EU’s very strong supporter.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and place Paris at the same level as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France’s devastated economy in a state of need.
The result is a right-wing anti-EU party, Marin Le Pen, the National Front, just won the decisive additional elections by putting the ruling party of socialists on third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24% of the votes, a timely warning to British Laborists that it is not possible to assume that a right-hand split will automatically affect the left.
What's Le Pen doing with her new-found popularity in the French white working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to set up a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If – and this is very likely – the anti-EU parties are backed up in this election, such a bloc will be able to dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
Here's my point: the growing sentiments against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will come together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not vanish, but it will again become a sort of vague “Europe (convincing) nations” that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and a few dependent economies can save the euro, but France and Southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
I'm guessing that Britain is moving away from this project, hoping to get closer to the US.
Still, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain is likely to be left out in the cold Atlantic.
In what position does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in fact) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect Scotland will be able to succeed in a freer European agreement, provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-Federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repeating Norway ' s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party Government in Scotland is, oddly, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which gained an impressive majority of votes in 2011 thanks to the objections to the cost cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of the Treasury, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent Tory and liberal Democrats coalition.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence just to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Aging earlier
African-American and Latin-American girls tend to reach puberty before their white peers do research.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close
There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic can be one of the triggers for early puberty.
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys.
A former CNN correspondent, Pat Eterage, is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be frightened if her daughter is beginning to form breasts and grow up with pubic hair at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, a child endocrinologist, Dr. Paul Caplowitz, explained that these early physical changes are common among American girls and constitute a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time soothing my parents, ” said Caplovitz, “usually, it doesn't mean a fast-starting full-grown puberty.
Evident signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and occipital hair, and the smell of the body, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a small change in menarche age (first menstruation) over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years and fell from 12.75 in 1970.
“As the breasts begin to grow, it is at least two to three years before the menarche,” said Caploitz, who also writes the book “The Rise of Puberty in Girls: How to Cope With this Difficult Problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is a discussion of what is the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered to be “pre-empty” when the breast increase is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to eight years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or slow down, and the paediatrician will be able to monitor closely.
Faster progressing can be a basis for an endocrinologist to test for serious problems, such as tumours or cystics.
There are procedures to detain early menstruation and to prevent another consequence: premature aging of bones, which can eventually result in slower growth and low growth at an adult age.
The recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is careful with the drugs, but admits that “addiction of puberty can alleviate the behavioural problems and feelings of girls that they are different from their peers”.
Another big problem is that the parents just don't want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy, or even how they will deal with hygiene,” Caplowitz said.
"It was a shock," a woman whose daughter began her menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-proclaimed theories about the causes of early puberty.
There is, however, no consistent evidence that hormones are responsible for milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media.
Boys, like girls, have early puberty.
Caplowitz claims that the pre-condition that has the highest weight is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, it contributed to a study of girls between 6 and 9 years of age, which links the amount of fat in the body to the period of puberty.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latin-American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are different explanations.
Worldwide, early puberty is likely to be affected by everything, from economic conditions to genes.
A further riddle is that while boys have face and puberty at a younger age, the trend towards full early puberty is less pronounced than girls.
Other AAP doctors confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The presence of acne and pubic hair even occurs in infants and children of crèche age.
“We have to be careful how we determine the true turn of puberty,” Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be shy to receive instructions from a paediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean an earlier than expected talk,” Kaplovitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who grow up early need proof that even when it is done before it is done, it is a normal part of life.
The United States Boeing is in Cheeta prepping for a flight.
The United States airplane, which carried out surveillance flights in the framework of the Open Sky Treaty over the territory of Russia and made an unplanned landing on Wednesday at Chite on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 a.m. Moscow time, will leave the city's air harbor.
The airport's authorities allowed the flight to take off after getting the money for the fuel.
The plane was reported to fly to Ulaan-Ude.
According to other data, he will go to the United States.
It was reported that the Ulan-Uda plane landed in Zabeikalsk province due to a mist.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita Airport.
There are 30 people on board, including the crew, who spent two nights on the airport, reporting ITAR-TASS.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, under the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, persons on board an aircraft have no right to go outside the Chita airport, they can pass border control at only two Russian airports, in Cuba and in Ulaan-Ude.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992 and 34 States are parties to it.
Observation flights take place over Russia, the United States, Canada, and Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, to help monitor the implementation of arms control agreements, and to increase the capacity to prevent and address crises within the framework of the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do the late celebrities make - MK in the U.S. MK
The highest-earning life celebrity rating in 2013 was led by Madonna, who earned 125 million dollars.
But it was overtaken by the late Michael Jackson, whose post-mortem income was 160 million from October 2012 to October 2013.
The other celebrities who left last year's "earnings" are lagging behind.
The second one on the list of the most well-off celebrities in the Forbes magazine was Elvis Presley, 55 million in a year, and the line below was the author of the Peanuts comics, Charles Schultz, with 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, who was a 25 million-year-old leader, and Bob Marley (18 million) were included in the first five.
The list also included Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein.
The first Boutique of Igor Gouliev opened in Moscow.
On 23 October, Igor Gouliev's first flagman boutique was opened in Moscow.
Designer Igor Gulayev is known to the general public for his excellent lux furs.
And now more fashion fans will be able to appreciate them, and his first boutique has finally been opened in Moscow, so the designer has a dolce vita party.
I'm sure there are the most beautiful girls in Russia.
So I'm especially glad I got a shop in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's a part of me.
That's the way Igor cut the red tape and invited everyone... to try on the look-alike models!
Jet manufacturers are fighting about the size of the seat when big orders are on the line.
There was a heated argument between the major aircraft manufacturers over the width of the long-distance tourist seats, setting the tone for the brutal confrontation at the Dubai Airlines Fair this month.
The argument is about the width of the seats provided on long-range flights to the economy-class passengers, whose interests are not always at the centre of the airlines, while the space allocated to them is key to the claims of the last Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would have a seat size of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the salons of the economy class, but its main American rival, Boeing, says that it is up to the airlines.
The argument is at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell larger versions of their two-motor long-distance jets, and at the event from 17 to 21 November, potentially record orders are expected.
The layout of the back of the plane, especially if 9 or 10 people sit in a row, is central to the statements on the cost-effectiveness of new mini-airbus projects.
Boeing states that its updated 777X will contain 406 people, based on the seats in the economic class, more than 17 inches wide, 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the rival version of her A350 will be moving 350 people in an economy class in 18-inch-wide seats, 9 in a row.
Airfaring giants often exchange technical hits through adverts in the professional press.
And now Airbus is talking to the public in front of an air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the start of a new advertising war could be by showing the financiers a slide of three people in a restaurant clinging to one another, entitled, "Would you agree to this?"
"Boeing offers long-range seat flights more narrowly than regional turbo-winter planes," said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
With a change in diet, people gain weight, but the plane seat has not changed.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the 747 wide-body Boeing set the standards for modern long-distance travel, and the border of the century, the weight of a middle American man between 40 and 49 years of age rose by 10 per cent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The 21st-century average man's waist is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health-care statistics.
Airbus claims that her competitor follows the 1950s seating concept, when the average waist of those recently called a “reactive public” was already in place.
Airbus says she ordered a study that shows that an extra inch in the seat's width improves the quality of sleep by 53%.
Boeing contests the airbus figures by seat size and says that manufacturers should not interfere in how to find a balance between fares and conveniences.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the salon is not dependent on the seat width alone.
“The real thing is to give airlines a choice and an opportunity to do what they think they need to do to succeed,” said Boeing in the Kent Craver salon.
They do not want us to decide for them what will bring them profit.
They know what they're doing better than anyone else.
For the passengers, the question is to expand the space on the side, but for the suppliers it is becoming more and more a factor that can affect the profit.
Behind this argument is a race to order a jet, estimated at at least $700 billion at cataloguing prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio of American to European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, seating is exactly what warms up rivalry in the fight between the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing have announced a 20-per-cent increase in profitability in their last two-motor long-range models as compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared Boeing features are based in part on a comparison of the 10-seat 777X series with the original 9-place set of the 777 design series.
The profit in unit cost is lowered when compared to the 10-seat design currently in use.
“The reason Boeing does this is to push up more space and make his plane more competitive than we do,” said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that a salon with a full 10-seat row for the existing 777s indicates that many people prefer a dense seating, which can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“Settings of 18 inches wide would be ideal for the passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is due to a threat from the 777th model,” said Mary Kirby, an internist, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not deliver chairs, but offer a directory of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world’s jet sellers even carry roulettes to test rival designs.
In order to be comfortable, all the manufacturers also offer very dense planes for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 rows, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the need for further modifications to the salons, offering wider passage spaces on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the single other manufacturer of major modern planes, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “fly, ” but it can divert attention from the 777X sales wave.
A new anti-nicotine vaccine can rob the smoking of fun
Scientists have developed an anti - nicotine vaccine that could rob the smoking of fun cigarettes.
One dose of the vaccine has been able to protect mice from life-long nicotine addiction.
More tests are needed before the human test, which will take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Whale Cornell College of Medicine in New York has said that the first results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a strategy for the use of a vaccine can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit by testing all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which was designed to deliver genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable stream of antibodies.
Antibodies track any molecules of nicotine in the blood, neutralize them before they reach the brain, prevent the smoker from getting nicotine.
In the tests, the immunized mice, who were later given nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And the mice who didn't get the vaccine "relaxed," and that's a sign of nicotine getting to their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, the shots had to be made so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower, because it transforms the liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Kristall said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they wanted to try a cigarette to prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers to stop smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of a nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of it,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Oleynikov: a third of the rural settlements of Podskovya
The vice-governor of Pod-Moscow, Yuri Oleinikov, stated that almost a third of the rural settlements of the Moscow oblast are entirely grantable
A total of 187 settlements out of 288 receive grants from the regional budget.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 receive grants from the regional budget.
The share of grants in the budget of 122 rural settlements is over 50 per cent, while 83 per cent is a grant.
As part of the budget, about 25 billion roubles are allocated from the regional budget," said Oleynikov.
The vice-governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Somitish, Lonely, and Pushkino - have a budget of more than 1 billion roubles in 2013.
The incomes of rural settlements in many areas are less than 3 million roubles, "it is not enough."
The cost of maintaining a local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements in Podskovya is over 70 per cent, “with a decline in the quality of services”, noted Oleynikov.
He had previously instructed the heads of the municipalities of Pod-Moscow to consider, before the end of November, which settlements needed to be consolidated, integrated into the city ' s districts, or to change the system of administrative administration.
The proposals will be completed by the end of January.
The Governor of the Moscow Region has previously stated that administrative reform in Podskovje is about to reduce the number of rural grant settlements.
There is also a request for the merging of municipalities in the Mojaysk, Kashir, Solar, Columensk, Lubertsach, and Kotelniks.
The urban and regional discussions will begin in November.
Mr. Igor Brinzalov, Chairman of the Ministry of the Interior, also stated that some 30 rural settlements in the 12 districts of Podskova were planning to bring all together in the coming Admiral.
This is due to the fact that less than a third of the 178 rural settlements in Podskovje have a “acceptable” financial base and 100 have a grant base.
Diana Arbenina was celebrating Halloween with her kids.
Diana Arbenin does not conceal how much she enjoys raising her children.
Despite Arbenin’s time in creation and social activity, she still has the opportunity to deal with Martha and Artem, not only spending time on their studies, but also entertaining as much as she can.
In the last week, Diana has twice reported to her fans on her pedagogical talents.
She first posted a picture on Facebook that shows how she teaches her kids to read.
And last night, I spoiled the fans, showing me how Artem and Martha dressed up for Halloween.
We're ready for the broom race! our first holloween" - so Diana called a picture of her kids dressed in holiday suits.
What is unwise is that they, like any other Russian boy or girl, have something to do with this holiday, because they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce an “undefined gender” when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow the registration of children born of hermaphrodite instead of male or female “undefined”.
The child's parents will have the right to leave the count "sex" on the birth certificate unfilled for a time.
For "F" (female) or "M" (male) parents can write "X" (undefined) for a time.
The aim of this decision is to prevent parents from rushing into a gender-specific operation.
According to the statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born of hermaphrodite.
Tripodie denies being influenced by Obaid.
The former New South Wales Minister of Labor, Joe Tripodi, will be a member of the State's anti-corruption oversight body.
Former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, denies the change in the lease of maritime facilities at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obaid, who held secretly shares in three properties on State land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid has lobbied several state ministers to extend leases to Serkular Ki, where the Obaid family owns two restaurants and cafes, without a bid after their expiry in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obaid ' s secret involvement in real property, following the testimony given by the former Deputy Chief of Administration, Mr. Tripodi Lynn Ashpool, on Thursday.
During the years of the discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease be open-sourced.
The tenants opposed this and also wanted a longer lease.
In 2009, business leases at Cercular Kee, which contributed about $2.5 million a year to the Obeid family, were extended without being presented for open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, according to Mr. Tripodi, urged changes in the Government ' s rental policy.
The ICAC decryption of the phone conversations was made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunne, a senior official who had come to the Ports Department after working under Mr. Obeid ' s direction in the Fisheries Department.
“Was the issue discussed during these phone conversations a matter of developing a commercial lease policy?”, asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wiley, Mr. Tripodi.
"No," Mr. Tripodi replied. "
I can't remember what was being discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
According to a high-level official, Israeli warplanes attack targets inside Syria
A high-level administrative official in an interview with Fox News confirmed that Israeli military aircraft hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night.
The official didn't say what the target was, but he said at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was a Russian-made SA-125.
At least two times earlier this year, Israel launched air strikes on cargo with rockets inside Syria.
Foreign Visa Workers of Division 457 can be tested for “trueness”
The “trueness” test for foreign workers on class 457 visas is under consideration by the Government, as it is about to expand oppressive measures.
The test, if accepted, will be applied to the criteria to prevent the use of 457-grade visas to fill unskilled posts or as a loophole for the transfer of family and friends to Australia.
The Government ' s paper for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McQue was critical of the Government ' s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying that it might offend Australia ' s neighbours.
“Break statements like `foreigners at the end of the queue' and `early Australians' are a very unpleasant setback to a time when trade unions were demanding a secure labour market,” she said to the Australian-Indian Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white work that needed to be protected, and if some in the region had seen the excerpts of this historical artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The document before the discussion set out 12 measures that had been previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials on the subject of trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the “validity” criteria are adopted, the applicant for a visa may be examined to see if the applicant is “true in a situation where the applicant is a relative or a close familiar owner or a person involved in the financing of the business”.
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of visa holders in Division 457, as previously enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of employees were then employed by hundreds.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker died of a conceivable heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man ' s nine-year-old son, who was aggrieved, accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father ' s death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin, who was also on board.
The Australian authorities hurriedly sent a man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A friend of Semen Varlamov said that a hockey player was having an alcoholic.
A friend of the hockey player Semen Varlamov, Evgeny Vavrinyuk, stated that he was suffering from alcoholism, was handing over to the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said the woman in particular.
Recall that Vavrinyuk sued for the beating of a Russian golopper by Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, the hockey player pulled her hair off, as well as battered her hands, breasts, abdomen, and neck after the attack.
Varlamov himself went to the Denver Police and confessed to the beating, detailing what had happened.
He was arrested, but was later released on bail at $5,000.
The court did not limit the sportsman ' s movements in the country, but it did not allow him to approach Vavrinyuk.
He also faces a prison sentence of up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The British Government has announced a study to increase the economic impact of the HS2 project on Scotland.
The HS2 project is to open a high-speed message to Scotland and North England, with the start of Phase 1 in 2026.
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, noted that the project would “unite Britain”.
The Scottish Minister of Transport, Kit Brown, said that he was "excited" about the prospect of working on a plan with the British government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
When Stage 2 is completed, the lines will be in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of a high-speed line between London and North England from £32.7 to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is in the process of negotiating with the Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in the rail bandwidth and the shortening of the trip time for North England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of moving from Glasgow to Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our goal on HS2 is to create a real national network that will bring Britain and its cities closer to each other."
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it brings are immense.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it's also about transporting cities to each other; all over the United Kingdom, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get the best message from HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's ad is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Kit Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to “mutually” support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "High-speed rail has every chance of bringing immense economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the common reasoning for the high-speed rail all over Britain."
We are therefore happy to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, for the benefit of all, and for the continuation of the Glasgow Line, Edinburgh, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British ministers next year and taking a joint decision on the next steps.
Thorium is a new hope for nuclear power?
Governments around the world are still thinking about how to meet energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) has a negative effect on the climate.
Renewed energy sources require a lot of space for generation.
Atomic energy costs both, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste management.
More recently, scientists have drawn attention to thorium, another radioaktiv element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and experts say that its splintering does not leave waste that has to be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia for the time being will be in force
Australian airfarers will need to continue to deactivate their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite United States measures to relax the rules on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Air Administration has allowed American transporters to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, on condition that they stay in Flight Mode.
Passengers can already do so during the main part of the flight, but it is irritable to many that they do not have access to their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required American airlines to do a lot of work to meet the new requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Department also noted that they were considering the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases still existed in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Department does not currently have special rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft”, he stated.
The issue is governed by regulations that require air carriers to maintain security at any time and for passengers to comply with the safety regulations that are communicated to them by the crew.
Virgin, which has already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, has not objected to the changes, but has stated that it will follow the direction of the regulator.
“We would welcome a review by the Civil Aviation Safety Department of the issue of permission for the use of electronic devices, because we do think that this will improve the quality of client services now that it (the wireless entertainment system) is on our planes,” said the Spokesman.
Qantas stated that it would follow the rules currently in force.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we are not planning to change them in the near future,” she said.
The FAA regulation applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in the regulatory changes that could benefit the passengers, and we will certainly look carefully at the decision of the FAW and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the effect of the order will vary from the airline to the airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
The carriers will have to prove that their planes are resistant to mobile radios, as well as to review the manuals, training material, hand-cuffing regulations and instructions for passengers.
“After the airline has checked and confirmed the immunity of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices, such as tablets, e-books, and smartphones, at any height,” FAU stated.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to disable their devices during the landing.
In addition, according to the group ' s recommendation, the heavier devices should be located under the seat or in the upper baggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan is heard in the anthem of Kubani by a note of extremism.
The football match between Angi and Kubanyu resulted in a political conflict between the Krasnodar and Dagestan authorities after the fans burned down the Dagestan flag, and the anthem of Kubani sounded in a different way.
The head of Dagestan, Ramazan Abdulatipov, on Thursday, invited the Republican Parliamentarians to go to court, because the anthem of Krasnodar is supposed to call for inter-ethnic discord, in particular, for war with the Basurmans.
Take the Anthem of the Krasnodar Region, which in our time was approved in 1995.
It's a shame, and no one's doing it.
"You are here to think of as your mother, as your enemy, as we go to the basurman's death fight" - for which to record such words in an anthem, to persecute some of the believers on the other believers," expressed solidarity with Abdulatype MP Gisri Shihshaid.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
Now, the news is from the ocean, namely from Syria, where, as we have learned today, Israel has hit the Russian-made rockets, which are said to have been for Hizbollah.
Today, Syria has met an important condition: to destroy its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement mediated by Russia, which enabled the US not to carry out a military operation that it was close to this summer.
More details on the weapons and what this means to the Syrian President will be given by our main international correspondent, Richard Engel.
Washington has stated that the Assad regime will be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died of poison gas in August.
And the punishment has come.
But not in the form of American bombardments, but in the form of a deal assad's friend, Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had decommissioned the declared chemical weapons plant.
A longer-term and arduous task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that Assad's days are numbered.
I think Assad has to go.
The question is not whether it's gonna happen, but when it's gonna happen.
He's no longer a legitimist, and he has to go.
But Assad stays.
And it feels more secure.
His troops still use artillery, rockets and napalm.
His opponents are disunified and ill-armed.
His people were forced to leave their homes, and many were starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad has escaped the punishment for mass murder.
The chemical weapons agreement is described as a success in diplomacy, the inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has made an impression of a man ready to cooperate.
Today, in Washington, the United States Ambassador to Syria has had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of hunger, it is not easy for his mother not to be killed with chemical weapons.
Assad's still holding up.
And he's changing his arms to power.
The President of the Russian Federation has created a separate Ministry of Construction and FSC
Russia’s President, Wladimir Putin, created a new Ministry for Building and GKH, and offered to lead it to the ex-governor of Ivanov oblast, Mikhail Menu, during a private meeting.
The president met Michael Menem at the New Ogarevo residence, and I did not refuse to head the new office.
The Spokesman for the Russian President, Dmitry Pescove, explained that all the functions related to the construction and the VCL are moving to a new ministry from Minor Region.
Mikhail Meng is the son of a prominent Orthodox minister of the protoirie of Alexander Me, and he graduated from the Moscow Institute of the Gübkin Institute of Oil Chemistry.
His political career began in 1995, and he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergievo-Posad Region, a member of the State Duma, the first Vice-Prime Minister of the Moscow Region, and a vice-premier of the Moscow Government.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Meng was the Governor of Ivanov oblast.
The pawn shopkeepers in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is having difficulty.
In a pawn shop at the Bendemir mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga puts a golden armband, ring, and earrings to pay for her daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is in it," says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia, where household debt is on the rise, is such that ValueMax, where it deals, has become the third pawn shop in Singapore this week.
Loan on jewellery is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Mrs. Amirthaling), but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, pawn shops in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just over 15.4%, at the United Overseas Bank office, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
But pawn shops have the advantage that they do not require a credit test or proof of pay and can make loans faster than banks.
Millions of people in the region are therefore in the pawn shops, as families are under pressure from the cost of living and the rapid growth of household and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth, following the global financial crisis, and low-cost credit, fuelled by free monetary policies in the advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to pawn shops to offset the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, identified an increase in the family's credit arm, mainly due to the growth of the mortgage, as a risk to the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list with 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
The economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely been out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continued decline in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
“The point is, with the rise in prices, people in the middle and bottom [the scale of income] will be looking for ways to make up for their earnings wherever they can, ” says Song Seng Woon, economist CIMB, the Malaysian Bank.
Recordedly high gold prices in the last two years have intensified the haste with which people lay their personal things, as they use the opportunity to get money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70% of the stuff in 200 city-state plombards are gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's put a golden chain on Grandma and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest pawn shop operator in EastyMoney has seen an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in the pawn business is such that ValueMax, the office operator in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, the executive director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion, using 60 per cent of the S$66 million borrowed this week as a result of the stock exchange in Singapore.
While some lenders had been critiqued by high interest rates, she said that the pawnboard not only offered cheaper fares than other lenders, it also did not increase the debt directly.
“Clients plant items that they already possess, and monetization of private assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
The lien is gaining wider public acceptance as a means of obtaining short-term, secured financing.
And the pawnshops are not just for those who are in a difficult financial position.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax offices to put up golden bars or Rolex watches, which can give up to 60% of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“These include rich people who need to borrow short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small-scale businesses that need to cope with temporary monetary difficulties,” says Mrs. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money very fast.
Today, it is not the number and status of health-care facilities that are available to the population, but the quality of health care.
The “Modernization of the health care of Tull oblast 2011-2013” programme, and the restructuring of our city's health-care institutions, will make it possible to set up an optimal health-care structure for the population, including gynaecologically ill, pregnant and pregnant.
For example, after joining with the gourmet, it was even more possible to bring in specialized specialists from the GUZ “IGCB” to consult pregnant women with a variety of pathologies, and to conduct additional hospital-based examinations.
Over the course of the modernization programme, the material and technical base of the maternity home has been significantly improved, and modern equipment has been put in place to meet global standards.
Over the years, some 8 million roubles have been allocated for the major maintenance of the premises, and 112 items of equipment have been purchased at a cost of 42 million roubles.
The most up-to-date equipment is an intensive post for newborns.
In the operating room, the Cesarean section uses a salle-saver device to collect blood from the O.R. and, after special treatment, to return it to the baby, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment has also been provided for a clinic-laboratory diagnostic unit.
An electronic registrar is in place at the women ' s clinic, and the introduction of electronic charts and sick stories of patients is planned in the near future.
The development of telemedicine has made it possible to consult gynaecologists, pregnant women, and newborns with regional experts.
Chechens beat up and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasburg
Chechens have been arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been under way since March this year.
Some 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
Reportedly, the bandits ordered prostitutes to a Hotel in Strasburg and then beat and rob them.
The gang's leader was a 27-year-old pre-convicted Chechen.
"Bavaria" defender David Alaba became the best athlete in Austria in 2013, reporting the official Bondsliga website.
In this argument, he outpaced the winter sports that have traditionally become the best in the country.
The skier, Marcel Hirscher, ranked second, and the skier, from the skiing of Gregor Schlirentsauer, ranked second.
Last season, a 21-year-old Aussie of Philippine-Nigerian origin helped his team to win the League of Champions, the German Cup, and the UEFA Super Bowl.
Arshavin's ex-wife is resting with actor Andrej Chadov.
The former civilian wife of the Peter's "Zenita" footballer, Andrei Arshavina Julia Baranovskaya, is on vacation with actor Andrei Chadov.
Julia is resting in Italy with an actress Anastasia on the road, her fiance is a figure, Sergei Slavnov, and an actor, Andrei Chadov.
Photos from the joint pairing exercise are published in Instagram of Anastasia.
This is not the first picture of Andrei and Julia.
On October 5th, the Roadway published a picture of a couple standing by the coast of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Xenita, Andrei Arshavin confessed to living apart from his civilian wife, Julia.
Remember, Julia Baranovskaya and Andrej Arshavin have been together since 2003, having three children.
It has recently been reported that Arshavin is dating ex-model Alice Kazmina.
Arshavin's new friend was married to the company's top manager.
A $325 million rescue package for Tasmanian health
The federal government insists that a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's weakened health system will be supplemented by strict conditions that guarantee that the state government will not spend any money.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plybersek, announced that the Commonwealth was taking “emergency measures” to prevent a crisis caused by the ageing of the island's population, a higher level of chronic disease, and system constraints.
A four-year funding decision was taken after consultation by the Government with the independent Tasmanian deputy, Andrew Wilke.
“The Government has proposed an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the particular problems facing the state,” Mrs. Plybersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a Blitz campaign on planned operations.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract removal operations, will help to bridge the backlog.
There is also money for unregistered clinics in Hobart and Lonceston, to improve the quality of post-inpatient care, to train health-care professionals, to provide mental health services and to implement personal electronic health-care card systems in local hospitals.
“These investments will be based on the ideas put forward by the advanced physicians on how best to help the Tasmanian health system,” said Mrs. Plybersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would work in strict accountability and responsibility.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report on a monthly basis on where it spends the additional funds.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the State delivers services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would not solve anything “unless a real reform that would put Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable basis will follow”.
However, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will greatly help to bring the state health system out of critical condition,” Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the State Government, these additional sampling procedures are to a large extent compensating for the recent cuts.
But Peter Dutton, the Federal Opposition for Health, believes that today's statement is a “leakoplasty-like solution”.
"The reason we're here is that the state's labor government vomited $430 million from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
When the state government pulls off almost half a billion dollars, and the Commonwealth invests 300 million dollars, you can't pretend to be good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Mrs. Plybersek to ensure that no dollar in the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Niklu's image of Dani Didreau can be overrated by an exclusive play and historical detail, but it is also more difficult to understand than it should have been.
The film, which is taking place in France in the 1760s, tells the grim history of Susannah, a young aristocrat, who was sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she suffers extreme cruelty at the hands of the sadist supremacy and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The movie never falls to obscene or sensationality, and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, narratives risk becoming a test, like a pencil, for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons, says the monitoring group
Syria destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with toxic gas, and announced on Thursday by an international monitoring group, while violent clashes erupted in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian group of activists claimed that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
A statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day prior to the
The deadline of 1 November, set by this organization based in The Hague, for Damaskus to destroy or “incapacitate” all means of chemical weapons production and mechanisms to mix chemical substances with the production of poison gas and to fill them with ammunition.
The completion of what is, in fact, an initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and neural gas sarin.
This statement was made during the brutal fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira, where the experts believe the chemical weapons production site as well as the storage site, is reported by the British-based Syrian Centre for Human Rights.
A group of activists who tracked the losses through a network of activists in Syria stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of that number, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government side, the group stated that 29,954 men were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-Government militants and 187 were Lebanese militants of Hizbollah.
Also among the dead, according to the statement, were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreign.
According to a United Nations estimate of 25 July, 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting in Safir for weeks with rebels, many of whom are associated with al-Qa`idah groups.
The Centre stated that there had been casualties on both sides on Thursday, but it did not provide specific data.
The fighting highlighted the danger faced by the chemical weapons inspectors in the short time frame of their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal, in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
The declaration of the OPCW, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was “now satisfied with the fact that it has verified and seen all critical production and mixing/refuelling equipment declared by Syria destroyed”.
She added that “no additional inspection activity is currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were not able to visit the two sites for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that both sites, according to the Syrian statement, were “displaced and ... items of the chemical weapons programme in them have been relocated to other declared sites that have been verified”.
It was not possible to find out immediately whether the site in Safir was one of the two sites that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you all have shown in the most complex mission this organization has ever undertaken,” said the Director-General of the observatorial group Ahmet Üzümcü in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has brought up rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad Government and its security forces, which are members of its Alavite sect, a sequel of Shia Islam.
With regard to other events, the head of the Rami Abdourrahman centre said that there had been a massive explosion on Wednesday at an air defence site in the Syrian coastal province of Lataki.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Worried by the verdict of the planners of the Bali attack
The 202 survivors and relatives of the Bali bomb in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence of the last of the conspirators who had been brought to justice and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who has spent almost 10 years on the run, as one of the most wanted in South-East Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years ' imprisonment for his role in building the explosive devices used in the attack.
He can be released within 15 years if he is on parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass killings as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed and dozens more injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist-related charges, including a wave of church bombings all over Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a life sentence, even though they could insist that a man who was called a bomber for his reputation as a bomber must be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memory of a mother from Perth June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in an attack by Patek and his associates almost ten years ago.
Hardly containing her tears, she said Patek was to be sentenced to death.
"I do think he has to follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
He has to stand in front of the firing squad, ” said Mrs. Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sari Club was demolished when a massive explosive device, parked in a van parked outside, was detonated immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack full of explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and died three times while being connected to a life-support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the massacre — Amrosi, Muhlas and Imam Saduza, who had been executed four years ago.
In fact, this guy deserves the death penalty the most.
Keeping him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds, that's not much.
Patek is the last party to the Bali attack to be brought to justice.
He has been in hiding for almost 10 years, but he was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottbad, where American troops killed the former al-Qa`idah leader, Usama bin Laden, less than four months later.
In the course of the trial, an FBI agent testified that the intelligence evidence was that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between the South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qa`idah.
"He didn't give up," said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he had not been sorry for the pain he caused to others.
The verdict is in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of the attack, to be observed later this year in Bali and Australia.
“This year there will be a lot of tears,” says Mrs. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: "Airline passengers can now use aircraft gadgets (but not call from a mobile phone)"
Airfarers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies, and listen to music, but not to talk on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Air Administration.
But the passengers must not expect the changes to take place immediately.
How fast this change is going to take place will vary according to the airline, said the Fau administrator Michael Worth at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show FAW how their planes meet the new guidelines and that they are updating their aircrew training aids and design rules to meet the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” FAU said.
At present, passengers are required to shut off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane's door is closed.
They must not restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet, and the captain will not give it "good."
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane is down for landing, and do not turn it on until the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference can allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and steering, FAU stated.
Most of the new aircraft and other fixed-wing aircraft, modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, the president of the Association of Professional Flight Flight Flights, welcomed the changes.
“After the new policy has been successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to do so), it will be a win-win option,” Gleiding said.
We have been sorely tired of feeling “teacher-in-the-school” when it comes to this.
But Internet connection for surfing, e-mailing, texting, or downloading will still be banned at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported.
The passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to the aircraft mode.
So there's still no "words with friends" - an intelligent Internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when an insinuating incident occurred: the actor was taken off American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was on its way to landing.
And the heavier devices, such as the laptops, will still have to be put in the baggage compartment, as they can be traumatizing someone if they fly all over the salon.
Mobil phone calls will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for phone calls is the Federal Liaison Commission, not the FAU.
The FAU may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Security Council, a national transport safety expert, CBS News, stated that cell phones were still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are a real problem, not just because they can potentially interfere with navigational devices, but we know, thanks to the FCC, that they can interfere with cell towers when the plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The Industry Advisory Committee, set up by FAU to study the issue, recommended last month that the Government allow for the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the FAH has been under pressure to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri's Senator-Democrat, Claire McCaskill, claim that there are no good security reasons for bans.
Compliance with the restrictions is also becoming more and more difficult, as the use of devices has become universal.
Some studies show that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore instructions to disable their devices.
The FAH began to limit the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to information about interference with navigation and communications equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airlines are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by FAUs as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruise altitude for a number of years.
Airplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of ships are designed to make more use of electronic devices in line with the new guidelines, said Worth.
Today's electronics usually emit far lower-power radio signals than previous generation of devices.
E-book readers, for example, e-mail only minimal messages when re-reading a page.
But the signals become more powerful when the devices download or send data.
One of those who sought to reduce the restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company downloaded a whole airship with its Reading Devices for Kindle's e-books and flew on it to test the problem but never found it.
Members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed sentiments as to whether the use of devices was a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passage Association stated that he considered interference with the devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only selected messages from the pilots that confirmed that the devices could interfere with air systems, and most of them were very old.
The committee recommended, however, that the FAU allow the pilots to require the passengers to deactivate the devices during the landings of the instruments in reduced visibility.
A group of representatives from the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step to meet the passengers who are now using a lot of technology.
“We are glad that the FAU recognizes that the comfort of the passengers is not incompatible with safety and security,” said Roger Dow, Director-General of the U.S. Tourist Association.
Schools will be able to pass a driver ' s license examination
A driver ' s license test will be available to private companies with their own computer-assisted motorway.
This is written by “Commersant” with reference to the draft Government Regulation “On Admission to Drive”.
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such motorways in Russia.
It is expected that the students of such “privileged” car schools will be able to count the results of internal testing.
In doing so, the State Inspectorate will monitor the examination every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30 per cent of the theories and more than 20 per cent of the field do not pass the first time, such a school will be denied privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for motorways contained in the Government ' s draft decree will come into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for two-wheeled driving.
From 1 January 2015, motorcyclists will be required to take an urban driving test to obtain category A licenses.
In addition, since 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire drivers of foreign nationals with foreign rights.
Such employees would have to receive Russian rights after the examination.
Bird transported by air to a safe place from a drilling rig in the North Sea, released back to the wild
A bird that was airborne to shore after it was found in an exhausted state at a North Sea oil tower was released back to the wild.
This water herd was placed on a helicopter heading to Aberdeen last month, and was then released by the Scottish Animal Abuse Society (SPCA) in a rescue center in Alla.
The manager of the center, Colin Ceddon, said, "This water herd is probably a winter migrant from North Europe who has hit the zone of strong winds over the North Sea."
Seems like the bird was exhausted and was able to find a place of refuge at the oil tower.
He added, "She was not able to fly again, so we were asked for help."
The water caretaker was in good health by the time he was released.
Is Europe’s elite ready to run a business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring together business representatives and to determine what changes the British creators of wealth and jobs want to see in their relations with the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most complete interview of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on Britain, business, and the EU.
YouGov has interviewed over 1,000 business leaders, representing a wide range of business in Britain in size, sectors, and regions.
The findings of the poll will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently looking for export opportunities outside Europe, with a particular focus on countries that are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are in stagnation.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India, and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and difficult process of reform of the EU’s thorny institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from competition to product laws, most business leaders felt that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with a single market, with business representatives claiming that the cost of regulation from Brussels now outweighed the benefits of being in the European trade zone, even 40 per cent of the major enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies, agreed to do so.
Last and foremost, our survey of business leaders has revealed that a clear majority wants Britain to take a course on a change in the contract and a trade-based relationship with the EU, not a policy one.
This result, which has been observed among all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on a “immediate change” that will return to Britain.
The rate is high, with the achievement of changes in the contract and more favourable conditions for Britain, a 16-per-cent turnaround in the vote to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that the British business supports his plan to re-enter Britain’s EU membership.
It also shows that business expects the revision to result in a major shift in the current balance of power back to Britain.
The best conditions for British business are possible and are becoming more necessary as the eurozone enters the path of closer economic and financial unification.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and, as the results of our survey show, for business this means a greater focus on trade and fundamental changes in the normative work of Brussels.
U.S. S.A. is listening to the pope's private phone.
The Vatican is under the watchful control of American intelligence agencies.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection show that US intelligence has been auditioning all the talks of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now very much in charge of Pope Francis.
His phone began to be tapped even before he became the head of the Vatican.
The new pope's election process was also monitored.
What was of particular importance in the United States.
The Secret Service has reached out to the Cardinals' cell phones, who have gathered in Rome to select another pope.
The phones of the place where the Conclaves lived were also heard.
American spies auditioned all the main contenders on the pope's throne to prevent it from becoming an unwelcome figure for Washington.
Panorama states that "the big ear of the United States" continued to intercept prelate talk until the end of the conclave on March 12.
In the United States, it is alleged that Archbishop Bergolio of Argentina has been named the future pope of Rome since 2005.
American intelligence was also engaged in negotiations for the election of a new president of the Vatican Bank.
An Italian magazine states that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives continue to work in the United States Embassy to extract information on political and financial flows.
The Vatican, in turn, reconciledly declared that it does not care about the American wire, even if it is.
From the U.S. leadership, the saints have no secrets.
The Snowboarder for the Olympic bill was specifically photographed.
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a memorable note on the city of Sochi, where the Olympics will take place this winter.
The number of bills is 100 roubles.
But on the web, bloggers are already actively ironic about the memorable banknote.
After a presentation of the Olympic bill on 30 October, they noticed that the image of a snowboarder from a note can be found in photo banks.
In particular, in a free vault, a picture of StockExchange, where this picture is from 2005.
The same picture is used in the Photoshop class, published on the Russian Web site "Megasur" on January 18, 2011.
It was also used in RugGear's smartphone ads.
The Olympic note was made in a blue-and-blue gum.
On the one hand, there's a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other, a kind of Olympic Stadium and a hotbird.
The author of the banknote was Paul Bushuev, who won a competition among the students of the Saint-Petersburg Academy of the Arts of Repen.
At the presentation, it was noted that a number of sports - skiing, freestyle, and skiing - were considered, but eventually selected a snowboard, as it was a relatively young sport.
According to the source of the news, close to the CBS, the regulator is not indifferent to the public view of the wide distribution of the image of an olympian snoewardist from the banknotes and is currently studying the situation.
But the State is not too concerned about the sound of the Olympic banknote.
The Head of State Press, Natalia Nikiforov, said to "the news" that all the reasoning about plagiarism was funny.
The Snowboarder on the note is going to turn to the right, and the photos on the network are going to go to the left, and she's got Nikiforov.
The man in the photo session to make the bill was shot from different angles, then the final picture was selected, and it was a characteristic posture of a snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic note, as the artist was paid for his work.
According to the experts, the discussion about the image on the Olympic bill was very positive.
The recognition of the image on the bill, plus for promotion, is considered by the executive director of the PNP, Rus Brand, Alexei Popovichev.
Proof of the 100 per cent resemblance of images on the bill and in the photobanks is very difficult, so it is unlikely that there will be any action to challenge the intellectual property of the image.
For the first time, an Olympic note appeared in China, with a memorable 10 Yuan note for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
The legal bans made the Russians drink less beer.
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
They think the country's beer consumption will stay the same next year, and that's best.
Although the businessmen originally expected to grow.
This year is not good for them: sales have fallen by 7 per cent.
The head of one of the country's major brewery companies, Isaac Shepps, the President of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers at the Third Annual Conference of the Adam Smith Institute, “Commodities of daily demand in Russia”, which has just been completed in Moscow.
It discussed the state-run regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already fallen by 18 per cent, as there has been a significant increase in the regulation of the brewery in the production and trade of beer - a low-alcohol drink - in recent years, Shepps told the listeners.
No country in the world has such a strict limit on the beer market, the unforeseeable imposition of new and new illogical bans, which are based on the alleged control of alcohol.
The beer-warker observed that many of the legal prohibitions to reduce alcohol abuse do not have much effect, but new initiatives are still on the rise.
Beer manufacturers have been the hardest hit by the ban on liquor in kiosks since this year.
"We just lost 35,000 customers," said Isaac Shepps.
The brewers have two prognoses for next year.
Optimist is the one Shepps was talking about: the sale of the foam will stay at the same level.
The pessimist is going to fall by another 2 to 3%.
In order to save their profits, businessmen have to move from the mass-consumer to the "premium" class: beer will be smaller, but it will cost more.
In the meantime, the radical effects of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
"As I see it, the level of alcoholism is about the same," said the drug doctor, Alexei Sotnikov.
True, there has been an increase in the number of sick people who use surrogates of strong drinks, as well as those who have been “obsessed” on alcoholic tonics such as Jaguar, while 10 years ago, it was the “beer” alcoholism that dominated.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford Auto Plant in Svetovodsk.
As the trade unions say, all those who have been dismissed have been compensated.
But much more than the problems of the workers, the issue of the reduction of production in the region is one of concern.
A deputy of the regional Zachs, Alexei Etmanov, stated at the meeting that about 600 people had been cut off at the Ford Factory in Vzvodosko.
This, he said, was the case in September, when about 600 people left the plant under the voluntary release programme, which was developed with the organization ' s trade union.
Workers who decided to quit on their own terms were offered “golden parachutes” in the amount of several salaries.
As a result, the vast majority left their jobs of their own free will.
But, according to Etmanov, that number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's what this is about.
In the next two years, however, the authorities do not plan to adopt any support programmes for regional enterprises in difficult circumstances,” he explained, adding that the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction in jobs.
In Ford, this information is not disproved or corroborated.
We're waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as he shows up, we're gonna publish it.
Talking about a contraction at the Ford Factory is going on a long time ago.
For example, the company's plans to fire 600 people had come to light in September.
The plant has previously declared a halt in the production of motor vehicles.
The reason for the plant was the fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, industrial production in Lenoblast fell by 5.4 per cent after nine months in 2013.
The production of vehicles and equipment fell by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobile phones can be used during the take-off and landing of the aircraft
The new rules for the safe use of mobile devices during the take-off and landing of the aircraft have been approved in the United States, and BBC has been announced.
American airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smart phones and tablets throughout the flight, and new regulations will be in place by the end of 2013.
However, Internet connection to receive and send e-mails will be prohibited during flights below 3 km.
As a result of the risk of interference with the aircraft ' s radio equipment, cellular voice will still be restricted.
In this way, airfarers will be allowed to read e-books, play tablets and other gadgets, and watch videos on internal and international flights.
Airlines will be required to check the safety of the use of electronic devices for the duration of the flight before the regulations are adopted.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to cope with the perceived impact of mobile aircraft and aircraft control.
According to the source, the U.S. example, it is also possible to re-evaluate the current standards for the use of electronic devices in flights in Britain.
The "Russian Mafia" in the United States has finally got a new name, "The Brotherhood."
This week, the blacklist of the "Russian Mafia" in America has been filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Department of Finance has introduced three representatives of Russia, two Uzbeks and an Israeli in the Brotherhood.
One of the Russians was a well-known singer, Gregory Leps, who is suspected of transporting money to members of the group.
In all, the U.S. blacklist contains 22 members of the Brotherhood and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts doubt that such an organization does exist.
"The declaration of the Brotherhood is more like an attempt to merge disparate criminal groups," said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime, and Professor at the University of New York.
In his view, the Brotherhood reflects a popular view of the Russian Mafia.
“I have not met anyone in Russia's law enforcement agencies or anywhere else to confirm the existence of such a criminal organization”, quotes Mr. Galeotti from the American Center for the Study of Corruption and Organised Crime.
Professor Liz Shelley of George Mason University also agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
"If they work together, it's more like a criminal network, but not an organization," she quotes the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organised Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the “brother's circle” was more united by a closer Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Dead Hasan.
The criminal authority was killed in January this year.
For example, the activities of Lashi Shoshanashvili and Zechariah Kalashov, who had completed the list in 2012, were closely linked to Opa Hasan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was Father Hasan ' s nephew.
He noted, however, that some individuals were not relevant to Usoian.
In his view, all of them had more common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
In the meantime, a scandal about the inclusion in the Brotherhood of Gregory Leps, Russia’s favorite singer, Vladimir Putin, has drawn the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American counterparts, so it has been so decided, why it has been put on such lists, says the Spokesman of the Head of State, Dmitry Pesco.
In any event, he (Leps) is a national of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
Head of Gazprom Alexei Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field
The launch of the Southern Flux gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said Head Gazprom.
“Today, a landmark event has taken place: the construction of a Bulgarian section of the Southern Flux gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” said Chairman Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
The “south stream” is designed to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The dispute over the contract between Gazprom and his partners in Ukraine, where most of Russia’s gas for Europe is located, increases the risk for normal routes, say officials.
Miller stated that the direct link with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geo-political risks associated with transit countries have been “for all time”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the Southern Flux at a lower cost as soon as the entire project starts to work in 2015.
Gazprom stated that the construction should start in other countries along the pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning, in the Sarat district, the driver of the Peugeot was on a crossroads at 115 km of Odessa-Renie, and ran into a bus with six people.
This is reported by the press office of the HSS in Odessa.
The incident killed a 31-year-old driver of a Peugeot car.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver who was hit by a leg jam.
The doctors provided the woman with the first medical care on the spot, and she refused to be admitted to the hospital.
The ambulance also examined all the other passengers.
Squads used a crane to pick up the bus and release the bus driver, whose leg was jammed at the bus door.

Two YMCA officers have been charged with sexual offences even before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission has come to know.
Two YMCA NSW officers were charged with sexual offences against children before the 2011 charges against a child care worker in Karingbah, Jonathan Lord, informed the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Violence.
But the commission's introductory statement stated that it “never had a case of sexual abuse of children within its organization”.
The Chief Executive Officer, Philip Hayre, was asked about one case in which YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and another case in which YMCA sports instructor Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hair told Gail Ferness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he was aware of the first case, but not of the second.
He admitted that YMCA also made an inaccuracies in the commission's introductory address, claiming that "there were external YMCA checks that recognized YMCA as being in the front row on child safety."
The evidence submitted to the Commissions indicates that YMCA has been notified that it has received the second of the four possible quality audits carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hair, who joined YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that he and the lower management had made a mistake by hiring the Lord, and was also unable to ensure a clear understanding by the staff of their obligations to report violations of the children ' s security policy.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hair rejected the assumption that the corporate ethic of YMCA had prevented the staff from reporting Lord's violations in the area of children's security.
The staff testified that they had observed the violations, including the fact that the Lord was alone with the children, personally cared for them, put them on his lap, said he loved one of them and let them play with his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the Lord's command and asked her to train her in the protection of her children, because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she found Jackie Barnath, the YMCA child care manager in Karingbah, who was the Lord's head, "very frightening and often hard to access."
The Executive Director said that he did not accept an explanation from the staff that it was awkward for them to report the situation to their senior management.
Rather, according to him, their friendship with the Lord led them away from the need to report him.
Mr. Hair said that he had presented his view to the New South Wales YMCA Council that the lesson for an organization from the Jonathan Lord event was not “relating to the provision of information” by the staff, and the Council agreed with it.
Mr. Hair stated that the decision to force the staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the charges were brought was taken by the YMCA Director General for Child Care, Liam Whitley.
He said it was meant to prevent the destruction of the evidence, but it was “exceeded” and the decision was not implemented well.
YMCA New South Wales was not a safe organization for children during Jonathan Lord's work in 2009-2011, and Professor Stephen Smallbone of the University of Griffith reported to the Commission on Child Debauchery.
He said that there were “serious problems” in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and monitoring staff.
The hearing has been postponed until 20 December.
It's a fashion week in São Paulo.
They don't think she's just a model, she's a real star.
Although Giselle Bündchen has for a while left her job, has been distracted by her motherhood, this week and this week's defilement, she has come on an ad hoc basis.
The absence of her for months has not prevented her from keeping her seat on the runway and on the pedestal.
Giselle is the world's highest-paying supermodel.
This time, she was at the Colcci Defile.
The end of the fashion week is usually the most interesting show.
Sort of something that Lino Villaventura's style player has done.
Marke has been active in the theatre and in the cinema for over 30 years, in parallel to the production of the luxe pret-a-port, and in the design of costumes for many well-known paintings.
In total, over 30,000 firms and companies that are relevant to the textiles and the fashion world participated in the end-of-the-mode week in São Paulo.
This is one of the most dynamic areas of production, with more than 2 million Brazilians working in it, and an annual turnover of 50 billion dollars.
Tony Blair said he'd take the chance to return as British Prime Minister, but he admits that return is unlikely.
Last night, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his resignation, a 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after 10 years as a leader, Blair has largely shunned the discussion of British policy, limiting most of her comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the four Middle East peacekeepers.
In response to a question as to whether he would return to the position of prime minister, Blair, according to London's Evening Standard, said, "Yes, of course, but I don't think that's gonna happen, so... "
The Chief Trainer of Milana, Massimiliano Allegree, expressed his regret for the result of the game of the 10th Tour of Italy with the Lacio.
The expert also noted that the failure at the start was due to a series of injuries to the major players.
I'm very sorry we didn't win, - quotes the Tmw word Allegree.
The team played a good match, creating 3 to 4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn't let Lacio do anything.
In the second, the Romans added, but in general, I can't say we've lost our concentration.
You had to win.
Last season, we met the task of joining the League of Champions.
Now we're behind schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries to key footballers.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players, with character.
But our composition is still good.
Look at Kaka, who met at a high level.
The experts of the horse-sporting events moving to Cardiff to fight for the “Foot of the Year” prize knew that the competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before doing his first move, this little boy and his pet Shetland pony toffee ran through three tourings to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple, the same height, has been rated for their appearance, behavior, and style at an annual competition held by the Sannibenk horse sports center in Radry, near Cardiff.
After taking a global view of the men and women in their delightful hats, he shook up his hat and sprang proudly in the circle of two-year-old Toffee.
The judges lauded Fenton for his ingenious ingenuity of dealing with horses for a period of time.
And Toffy got the highest grade for appearance and character.
Fenton was given to Toffee on his third birthday last March, and he's been studying with a Shetland pony every day ever since.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a wonderful duo."
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a golden cup and a rose.
It was just his second talk to Toffee, and we all loved it when he won.
It was considered so phenomenal by people in the arena that they wanted to take a picture of it.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abb Vale in South Wales, is following the steps of her aunt Sharon Howells, who has been running horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said, "The public was astonished, and everyone was yelling and clapping."
He ran down the sand all over the arena and, although he looked so tiny, he did a fine job.
Fenton is crazy about animals -- he likes horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chicks he cares about.
Judging from how he began, he will soon be taking part in the Loss of the Year — and I am sure he will do well.
The representative of this annual horse show said, "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The judges commended Fenton and Toffee for their appearance and for the way in which they introduced themselves to the show.
They're looking at the alignment of the pony and the planter's performance - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his pretty dress, he was really good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper called for “to be reorganized”
The Chinese newspaper, which published on the front page a call for the release of an accused in the slander of a reporter, must be reorganized, reports the press regulator.
The New Express, a newspaper in Guangzhou, made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of a journalist, Chen Yunzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on TV that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with a public share of property.
Now the New Express has to go through a “complete error correction process,” as the regulator states.
The order for “fixing errors” came from the Guangdong Authority in the field of press and publications, radio, film and television.
The preliminary investigation revealed that Young Evening News Group published a number of false reports about Zoomlio's listed company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The New Express has been disorientated,” states the regulator’s statement.
He states that a decision has been taken “to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yungzhou in the form of a withdrawal of his reporter's license”.
He also “advised Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete correction of the errors in the New Express and recommended that it investigate the situation-related press and immediately change the management of the New Express.
Mr. Chen wrote a number of articles for the New Express, in which he claimed financial irregularities in a construction company called Zoomlio.
After he was arrested, his newspaper published on the front page two calls for his release, stating that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on State TV, admitting that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlio, as well as the entire news industry, and its ability to earn public trust,” he said to the state-run broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen's confession, the New Express released an apology on the front page, saying that the newspaper was not able to properly check his reports.
Recently, several high-level suspects made confessions on TV.
The experts say that the practice of extracting confessions in China is still widespread, despite the recent amendments to the laws that prohibit the authorities from coercing someone into self-incrimination.
A U.S. tunnel — Mexico for the transport of drugs, equipped with its own railroad
There was one of the most complex drug-smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation, and electric rail system.
The U.S. authorities have described this tunnel four by three feet wide as one of the most complex secret paths ever found.
This tunnel, which has zigzags of about six football fields, links warehouses near the city of Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
The area is filled with invisible warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs in trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs, as the authorities had said, were smuggled.
According to the court records, the law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was found.
Three men who, according to law enforcement, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they would be sentenced to 10 years ' to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, in the state of Arizona, smugglers use vast underground drains.
The tunnel is the eighth major tunnel found in San Diego since 2006.
Several major tunnels were found in Central Mexico after a marijuana harvest in October, which made it a difficult task for drug cartels to deliver their products to users quickly.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards, equipped with rail tracks, from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two depots in San Diego.
In Belarus, pensions have been increased since November
In Belarus, pensions have been on the rise since November of this year and have been reported to the BELTA Correspondent at the Department of Pensions of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
As from 1 November of this year, the national average wage of employees used in the previous recalculation of pensions will be adjusted, with an increase of 5.4 per cent, and the corresponding recalculation of the labour pension will be carried out in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on the increase in pensions.
As a result of the re-estimation since November, the age pension is estimated to increase by an average of 5.3 per cent.
The average old-age pension will be Br2 million 295,000.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million people in the Republic.
The cost of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus for the payment of increased pensions will increase by Br274.3 billion per month from November this year.
Simultaneously with the recalculation of the labour pension in November of this year, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and supplements to the pension will be recalculated as a result of an increase in the per capita minimum subsistence budget.
BPMs for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 have been approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 million,530, an increase of 2.1 per cent over the period from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, with effect from 1 November 2.1 per cent, the minimum levels of work pensions, social pensions and allowances, promotions and pension supplements will be increased.

The British Police give Assanja a notice of extradition.
The British police today gave a notice of the release of the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who hid at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked for asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they stated that they had given a 40-year-old Australian a “official request for surrender” to report to the police station, adding that if he failed to do so, he would be subject to further arrest.
Assanjoe faces extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he has exhausted his options under British law, when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand it over to the United States, he took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June, seeking political asylum from this South American country.
Scotland Yard “took a 40-year-old man a formal request to surrender, which requires him to come to the police station on the day and time of our choice,” according to the press reporter.
He's still in breach of bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the police notice.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible charges of espionage following the release of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic papers on the anti-separate WikiLeaks website.
Driver at 130 miles an hour with a hot drink between his legs, fined £1000
The driver was fined £1000 for driving up to 130 miles an hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
A 35-year-old Andrew Howie of Tipptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on A-120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to take between his legs.
In the Court of Justice of the Court of the Court of the Court of the Court of Justice, Howie admitted the charge of driving without due diligence or care.
The addition to his driver ' s license of seven penalty points led to a six-month driving ban.
Howe was also required to pay £90 and an additional fee of £100 to assist the victims of crime.
The tax on foreign real estate owners will cause the London bubble to burst.
The Treasury has made a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osbourne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a 7 per cent national tax rate for homes with a value of more than £2 million and an annual payment to customers who choose to own a house in a partnership, not as a natural person.
So far, the state of property in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which was £708 million in the 2012/13 financial year, is already in excess of the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, Northwest, Yorkshire, and Humber.
Mr. Cooke stated: “In the wake of an increase in public debt on high-value homes and the associated anti-evasion legislation, it is very hard to say that taxing on high-value real property is understated, irrespective of the influence of an obsolete municipal tax system.”
“But this move may cause some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy real estate in London or the current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
The value of first-class real estate, the top 5–10% of the housing market at the price, rose by a record 11.8% in the last year in the rich Southwest London belt, from Fulham to Wimbledon.
According to a study by Savills, the prices in central London continued to show a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an active “country market” with an upsurge in the south-west, in the north (7.4%) and in the east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists shed light on the way the dog’s tail moves are related to her mood.
Early studies have shown that the contented dogs waving their tails to the right (in the dog's view), while the alarmed dogs waving their tail to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can see and respond to these subtle differences in tailing.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neurologist at the University of Trent, states: “It is well known that people in the left and right of the brain are divergingly involved in the formation of agents that cause positive or negative emotions.
Here we've been trying to look at this in other species.
He added that, as with humans, the right-hand side of the brain controls the left-hand side of the body, and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play a different role in emotion.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the multiple wigging of the tails of other dogs, researchers observed animals watching movies about other dogs.
They've been measuring the heart rate of the animals and analyzing their behavior.
We'll probably soon find out why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes the other.
Professor Vallortigara said, "We've shown the dogs a video of the dogs, either naturalist versions or silhouette, to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and point the tail more to the left or to the right.
When the animals saw that the rest of the silent dog was moving his tail to the right (in terms of the swelling dog's tail), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was bowing to the left, again in terms of the tailing dog, their heartbeat was increasing and they looked alarmed.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think the dogs had been knowingly talking to each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experience which movements they should be concerned about and which they should not.
He observes: “When there are a few encounters with other dogs and often the slinging of their tails in the same direction is related to more friendly conduct, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, vetters, and trainers a better understanding of the emotions of their diet.
An expert in dog behavior, John Bradshaw, an invited researcher at the University of Bristol Veterinary School, said that this was not the first study to see if the left and right side of the dog mattered.
Last year, a group of scientists at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if they look at a happy dog.
And at another University of Victoria University in Canada, he reported: "The dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog, when the swelling of his tail was going to the left rather than to the right rather than to become alarmed, the opposite of the Italian study.
He said that the difference might have been due to the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not fully view the animals in films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
“As there is enough evidence for different mammals that the two brains are being used for different purposes, many details have yet to be clarified, and the dog is no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their conduct can be recorded, it is likely that we will soon find out why their tails are sometimes headed in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys is postponing a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness.
Rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed the concert in Glasgow after her singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This Chieffield band was supposed to play at the Hydro City Concert on Friday.
But Alex Turner's vocalist disease made them move the show.
The group's statement was made after it was also forced to postpone the concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys stated: "After the decision to transfer the show to the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical help from the Arctic Monkeys, the show should also be postponed to the Hydro site in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November."
“Alex Turner was diagnosed with laryngith, and, unfortunately, he is not in a position to speak.”
The LG Arena show in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the Glasgow show will take place on November 21 at Hydro.
All the tickets to this show are valid.
We want to apologise to everyone who owns the tickets for any inconvenience that this has caused them.

Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February
The pope of Francis will assemble the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on February 22, as the Vatican declared on Thursday.
The Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually be involved in the selection of his successor.
There are currently 201 Cardinals.
But after the cardinal has reached the age of 80, he is no longer able to take part in the pope’s election, which is the prerogative of the group of 120 “electoral cardinals”.
In announcing this news, the Vatican Press Secretary, Father Federico Lombardi, said that a meeting of all the present cardinals, known as the Consistory, would be held before the Sanctuary.
“Papa Francis has decided to inform in advance of his decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from around the world,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinals would probably drop.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as it takes to bring the number of cardinals who are elected back to 120, as well as the number of cardinals who are over 80 years of age as he pleases.
The consistory next year will be of great importance, because it will be the first since Francis was elected last March, according to Valero.
So far, there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe, and especially for Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from other parts of the world to rebalancing,” he said.
In South America, 40 per cent of Catholics live, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first Cardinals to be selected since the formation of the Cardinal Council of Francisco, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, who has been assigned to look for ways to reform the Church.
In the past, Dad made his own decision.
“Now Francis has selected eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said that it was “full possible” that Francis would go to the Cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before — this is all for the first time.
Valero said that the popes usually appointed a cardinal bishop from the big parishes, but Francis was “full of surprises, so we don't know who he's gonna call.
GM withdraws a number of new pickups in the United States to develop seat backs
General Motors Co is recalling almost 19,000 brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Seaerra of the 2014 model to address the manual seat back adjustment problems, as per a Friday's notice from the U.S. Automobile Safety Regulators.
On some of the pick-ups, the front seats may be defective in the back pan.
As a result, the seat backs do not meet the federal road safety standards for head restraints.
“In the event of a rear impact, the head restraint may not adequately protect the occupants by increasing the risk of injury”, a notice on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website.
The recalled models were made from 1 August to 10 September.
The release of GM pickups began in June and is the most important roll-out of a serial car for the leading American car manufacturer since it was re-structurized due to the 2009 bankruptcy.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Traffic Safety Administration was not in a position to consider a notice to the owner in connection with the 16-day shutdown of the Government, which reduced the growth in car sales in October.
Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the model year 2014, rose by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of the year, as GM stated on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM stock on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 per cent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
Obama’s Voter’s Cry of Desperation
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope for possible change.
He says that Obama has allowed the Republican obstruction to negate laudable efforts.
Obstacleism can't justify problems with the Obama-reformed health system web site, drone attacks.
The 2008 Obama campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what might be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard University School of Medicine.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would cheer me up in a time of despondent in my second year of medical school and give me a sense of hope.
It's called The Vigority for Victory, and it's a memoir about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I end up writing my patient reports at night and I go to bed, this book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people, and the performances could be breathtaking.
The victory in the elections was impressive, and the leading news programs paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates wept for joy, and my parents guarded all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists was to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
At the time of Obama's entry into office in 2008, the level of support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
A return to the present is a brute awakening, like a pull out of a dream.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, the changes have indeed taken place.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and diverse achievements, from the adoption of a law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the lifting of the rule of “Don't ask, don't talk, ” the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstruction has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health choices and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But after countless times I've been on the side of Obama's administration, defending it in front of my peers and colleagues, I've run out of explanations that I can give.
I've reached a point of political desperation.
The obstructionism of the Republicans cannot explain the permission to listen to foreign leaders or to attack innocent children in other countries by drones.
It cannot explain the collection of data on American private life by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of incriminators exposing government misdeeds.
He cannot account for the murder of an American national, Anwar al-Awlaki, without trial or investigation, or for the failure to meet the limits of public funding and spending during the presidential campaign.
He cannot justify the report's findings, which states that the White House's efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.”
More recently, it cannot justify the failure to develop a simple web site for more than three years after the law on affordable health care has been signed.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have known at the age of 18 that leadership can run counter to the political campaigns that precede it?
Evidently, working for an elective office is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be shaped by an opposition political party and by such incidental events as the slaughter in Newtown.
Nevertheless, all of the examples I have listed above show that they were to a large extent their own choice of administration.
And that's what's bothering me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was very enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, and it seemed that he was not in a position to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I thought that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, would live up to the hopes we had heard for so long.
But when Obama’s rating fell below 45% this week, it became much more difficult to return to 2008 with the book.
It makes me miss a lot of promises that have vanished.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton overwhelmed Obama in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting to analyse the reasons for the failure, he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay on track.
"I want us to get our appeal back," he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The views expressed in the commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest with regard to parental leave.
MP Milliardaire Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of parental leave, because his daughters can get pregnant and profit from it.
This mining magnate, who has an unfinished carbon tax dispute of $6 million, made this statement at a time when he was trying to get rid of the question of whether he was in conflict.
The Palmer Allied Party can control up to four Senate votes, which can be critical in deciding to set off taxes on carbon emissions and mining.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest, and said that Mr. Abbott ' s daughters would personally benefit from political action.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they get a leave of absence,” Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer to be the winner of the Sunshine-Cost election seat in Fairfax County with 53 votes after the recount.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the electoral counting process to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott Francis and Brigitte.
Should a decision on these elections be taken two months after we voted?
"We need to have a better system," he said.
Why don't we have a system so we can come in, put our data on the computer, vote immediately, and get the result at 6:30 the same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
The use of a pencil in our time seems odd.
The Electoral Commission is in the process of exploring options for an electronic vote and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, a 59-year-old, said that his programme included an international airport for Sunshine Cost and would take his new work very seriously.
Public office means serving the community.
“We do not seek any rewards other than the thanks of history for being able to serve this district at a critical moment,” he said.
RBS suspends two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily suspended two traders in its Exchange Division, according to two people who are familiar with the situation, which is further proof that the global audit by the regulators of the alleged currency market is fast-growing.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with regulators in the world's largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
The two traders will be the first RBS officers to be removed from the unfolding investigation, which is associated with the LIBOR interbank-to-bank-to-bank-to-manipulation scandal.
By refusing to comment on the suspension, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from the regulatory authorities this month.
“Our current investigation of this matter is still under way, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and our other regulators,” the bank reported two weeks ago.
Last month, well-informed people said that RBS sent e-mail records and instant messages, which he received and sent to his former trader, the British regulatory body, the FCA.
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and is known to have been given leave in his current position as head of European spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot trade in Citi, left on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by the Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of the traders was charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher's contact group for instant messages included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to the well-known persons.
The UBS bank reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finnma, said it was investigating the alleged currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators around the world — the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority, Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Currency Authority — are considering allegations that bankers have conspired to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Credit Suisse also began internal checks, or received requests for information from the regulatory authorities, who were familiar with the situation.
Banks have been looking at instant messages and e-mails over a number of years in the search for offences.
The audit news has led to traders in the area of activity, which has been one of the major sources of revenue for the investment bank trade units in recent years, but has been facing difficulties this year, due to the fact that low currency volatility has reduced the opportunities for the buyers.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the severity of the situation, saying that a vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always the right thing to do.
According to the senior trader, despite the massive volume of daily trade in the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trade platforms and the wider use by banks of their domestic platforms means that “you can begin to influence the market at a very low cost.”
The news came on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one of the traders in its stock trade department at the London Exchange this week, after it had caused a loss of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are certain that the trader was acting alone and that the issue was localized,” Credit Suisse reported.
Supreme Court of Justice supported Obama's Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court today held that Barack Obama’s landmark health law is constitutional, a major victory for Obama’s administration.
In a vote of 5 to 4, the judges ruled that separate orders under the Patient Protection and Accessible Health Care Act requiring citizens to acquire health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine were constitutional in accordance with the Government ' s tax authority.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy objected.
The Court also upheld the rest of the 2700-page Act and further held that the requirement of the Public Health Act to make the states more responsive to the Medicaid program, or they would lose all federal funding for the Medicaid program, was not unconstitutionally coerced.
Twenty-six states and the National Federation of Independent Business filed an action to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 season of the primary election, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
Football is the cause of the discord?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the Open Tribune, politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
One of the suggestions was to ban football in the North Caucasian, because it's just scandals and rifts.
The Speaker, Sergei Narishkin, recalled the recent events in Birylev and said that in order to reduce the “grade of public tension” of politics and the media, statements must be correct.
He probably meant the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the TVs threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire if they didn't want to limit the birth rate...
All the speakers spoke of measures to regulate migration from the Commonwealth of Independent States, and of measures to harmonize relations among the peoples of Russia, which added to the debate confusion.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryul was "a model conflict that could have been predicted," but "we have too many people and institutions to answer for," and the seven Nannys have a child without an eye.
The concept of multi-culturalism, which Europe has been practising for a long time with respect to migrants, has, in the opinion of the public, failed, and we have to look for our way.
Historian Yuri Petrov put great hope in a new single history textbook.
"There is also a need to create a manual on the history of the country's culture so that the students in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zuganov has proposed to criminalize “the call to dismember Russia”:“If you say on the radio in the United States that you have to hand over to Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!”
Wladimir Zhirinowski was very hard to "don't light up."
As usual, he blamed all the journalists who put sick and acute national problems on the public debate: "There's nothing to say in the heat of the debate!"
The leader of the “One Russia” faction, Vladimir Vasiliev, immediately advised the journalists to conclude the “hart” and to agree to talk about the subject carefully, and then the same commitments can be made by the politicians.
We have some 30 laws that govern migration, and there is a general order, Mr. Vasiliev said.
By way of example, he cited a law that held regional and municipal authorities responsible for inter-national peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andrichenko was not in love with the law: it has no “clear idea of what it means to adapt migrants, its mechanisms and its limits.
The scope of these powers will therefore be interpreted in a different way by the parties.
In addition, the municipalities do not have the capacity to deal with such complex issues, the means to do so, and the guidance they could use, the centre does not give them ...
The head of the Douma Committee for Nationalities, Gajimet Safaraliev, has proposed the creation of a special agency with the frightening name “Ministry of National Security” to deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s was the head of a similar office, which was subsequently abolished, objected.
It's enough to have a special man at the federal level, a "minister without a briefcase," to whom you can turn if you need to.
"We go on the edges, the projectiles go off side by side, and it's very important for members of different ethnic and religious backgrounds to stand up to the provocations together, and this work needs to be well-informed, "speaked by a representative of the RPT for links to the society of Allvolod Chaplin.
There should be no neutrality of the State vis-à-vis dangerous ideologies, religious, including in its view.
Here Oleg Nilov put the discussion in an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, we need to look for more, but they're being pushed to the wrong path, the wrong way," he said.
"The wrong way" is the development of football: "The footballer is beaten up with the whole crowd, the flags are burning, the comrades are stoned to one another...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There's another sport called rugby...
"They won't be the same in the world in this sport!", said the prosthetic.
No one will play in the Rugby in the Caucasian! - Mr. Zhirinowski intervened at once.
You're gonna give 'em another curling!
You need to know the national specifics, it's like offering a Georgian Zaporozian...
In Jaroslavla, wild behavior on the stand was distinguished by the representatives of the Moscow Club, during the game with the local club.
Football has to be banned all over the country...
The head of the Russian Federation's supervisory and disciplinary committee, Arthur Grigorianz, reported that the Cuban was fined 500 000 roubles, handing over from the Home of Football to the Correspondent "SE" Philip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions have been imposed on the Reddar Club for arson of Dagestan's flag by fans on the stand during a home game of the 14th Tour against Ange.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a man from the Russian Federation.
We've been looking at all the available material.
For the misguided behaviour of the Cuban spectators, it is fined 500,000 roubles.
Google, Samsung, Huawei have filed patent claims against Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent claims against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the value of which was interrupted at the Northell Bankruptcy Auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which bought $4.5 billion in Nortel patents, sued the U.S. District Court for a patent violation against Samsung Electrics Co. Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawi and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson, and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents cover technologies that help to match key Internet searchwords with their respective adverts, and the claim states, which is the basis of Google's search business.
Samsung, Huawei, HTC, and Rockstar were not available for comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones from Google's Android operating system, which competes hard with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google raised the proposed price a number of times, eventually offering a total of $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in part the Motorola patent library was the determining factor in the transaction.
“Despite a failure to obtain the patents that are the subject of the action at the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate it,” states the lawsuit.
Rockstar requires a higher recovery from Google, as he claims that Google's infringement of patent rights is premeditated by the claim.
In Egypt, the first freely elected President is sworn in
Mohammed Mursi is sworn in, but the day of its celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he took an oath, becoming the country’s first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was demolished 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi was also the first freely elected Muslim President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath in front of 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the shore of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We want a better future, a new Egypt, and a second republic,” said Morsi during a solemn ceremony on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life — absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that, for the most part of its 84 years of existence, was a banned organization that was a target for the brutal actions of successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Mursi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new President, and, unlike the Mubarak presidential pump, the movement was stopped for a short time to pass his convoy on the usually lively road linking the city center to the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi was mocked as a non-charismatic “rescue wheel” of the Brothers, his personal prestige has increased dramatically since his victory and his Friday performance, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists, but also for all those who want to complete the 2011 insurrection against authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mursi, wearing a blue business suit with a red tie, to the judges in a wooden hall, where he took the oath.
Mursi later went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural address.
He was given an official reception with an army band that performed the national anthem, during which he was standing on the stand “at all times. ”
A paramedic paramedicsman, Hussain Tantavi, was present.
His arrival was met with the slogan “Army and the People - One Hand”, which was scolded by hundreds of people who met in the main lecture hall of the University.
Founded in 1908 as the mainstay of secular education, the University of Cairo in the 1970s became the seal of Islamist student groups.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where a revolt erupted that ended the authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year, and promised to return the office of the President, who had been deprived of his office by the Military Council, who had taken action from the deposed leader.
But by agreeing to take a formal oath of office before the court, and not before the Parliament as it is, he is doing the will of the military, and it is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of theatrical populist gestures.
Another meeting of the Tumen Region Engineering Association was held at the Yalutorov Automotive Factory.
As part of the event, a new line for the production of electric pipes from steel was launched.
As the business director, Denis Gribanov, explained, a marketing study on the steel market in the Tumen oblast was carried out in 2011 with the new owner.
It has been found that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electric welds per month.
It was then decided to alter the plant ' s profile and install the plant ' s production equipment.
Already this year, more than 7,000 tons of production have been shipped.
The investment in the plant was more than 120 million roubles, told Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new state was launched, which would increase the range.
The plant produces both a small profile of the pipe, which is used for the household, small-scale construction, and the furniture industry, and a large one for the construction industry.
It is planned to reach the level of production of 50,000 tons of products per year, about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen Region.
Despite the move to another type of activity, the number of employees in the plant has not decreased - it is now 157, and the plan for the acquisition of new equipment is to increase the number of staff by more than 50.
The company is re-training and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
In the next year, a new system of longitudinal cutting is planned to be up to five millimetres thick, which will reduce the cost of the product, as well as another plant, at a rate of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is about to learn to produce pipes that are used in the housing and public utilities.
The company ' s management is committed to closing up to 70 per cent of the needs of the Tumen Region for this product.
The Deputy Director of the Department of Investment Policy, Leonid Ostromov, called on business managers to give more attention to the modernization of engineering.
This is also being done by forms of public support for industry, which include the reimbursement of interest rates for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of its lease.
This year, 150 million roubles have been allocated for this purpose, and two thirds of the sum has already been spent.
The last commission to review subsidy contracts will receive the documents from the enterprises up to 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses the cost of local producers participating in international fairs.
For next year, a budget of 150 million roubles can be used to compensate for lease payments and loans for new equipment.
Five million will be allocated to fairs, three million will be allocated to energy saving.
Funds are being reduced to 72 million roubles for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is being made in the south of Tumen oblast for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostromov, this form of support will end in the long run, as the reason for it was to pay off the mineral tax that the oil companies paid in the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so, and the subsidies become a direct expendable obligation of the region.
With this in mind, the Government of the region has given priority to direct support to the industrial sector, not to the financing of the oil industry through it.
The budget support will be related to investment projects to be implemented in the workplace.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the emerging situation with the oil industry.
The subsidy for the equipment they buy is a competitive advantage for the industry in the south of the Tumen Region, and if it is eliminated, it will be difficult to compete at the cost of the Russian medium, where the labour force is cheaper.
In addition, the issue of the continuity of the new owner of the RV-TNC, the company Rosneft, which has not yet placed its orders in the tumenian enterprises, is not clear.
The agreement for the implementation of the Uvata project is due to expire in 2013 and no request for extension has been received.
Nowadays, the Southern Region, which specializes in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for next year.
The open question remains whether the taxes from the oil from the Uruguayan region will be made available to the region ' s budget, or whether they will be paid at the place of registration by the new owner of the deposit.
Tomich will work 240 hours for an extremist social media spot.
The Leninsky District Court of Tomsk ordered 240 hours of compulsory work by a city resident, who posted an extremist video on a social network, informed RIA Novosty on Friday by a representative of the regional court press office.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his page on a popular social network, which was placed on a federal list of extremist material.
A criminal case has been brought against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, “Actions aimed at inciting hatred and hostility, as well as at demeaning the human person in public”.
“The Leninsky District Court considered the case in a special manner and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned offence, with a sentence of 240 hours of compulsory work,” said the interviewee.
She added that the man fully pleaded guilty.
Azarov promised the Ukrainians a collapse in the price of goods after the signing of an association with the European Union.
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that the country ' s prices will fall significantly once the country has signed an association agreement with the European Union.
He announced this in his Facebook page.
I can certainly say that prices are driven by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
With the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area provision, the level of customs duties on the import of goods from the EU will be significantly lower.
And that would mean that prices should also go down.
"It's about the products that come from the EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other products, the effect of the agreement on prices would not be so direct; it would be indirect.
But there should be no price hikes, either.
So the reports on the billboards, which have recently come up with a lot in our country, that the association with the EU is a price hike, it's not quite the case, or, to be more precise, it's not, is summed up by Azarov.
Investigators check information on ill-treatment of a child in Biiske
On 29 October, the media released a report that a day-care teacher in the city of Biyska had locked a child in a cellar for educational purposes.
Investigators are currently investigating all the circumstances, as well as legal assessment of the actions of the day care staff.
After the charge of the bad taste of Eugenius Vassileva, she spoke
Eugenia Vasiliev, who has been the focus of the media for almost a year, has not yet commented on the many press outlets, both about the theft in the DOD and about her personally - the relationship with the former Minister of Defence, Anatoly Serdukov, her poetry, and her addiction to valuable things.
On 1 November, however, the figure in the Defence Service case broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasiliev stated, "The original task was, of course, to get any negative information out of me about the former Minister of Defence."
There was a blackmail to get me to testify, or I'm gonna go to jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Next we go to court, we prove our innocence.
We're 100% sure of a win.
In this interview, we can conclude that Vassileva may have been the most affected by what was said about her taste.
It is possible to refer to the statement made by the official representative of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Markin, that the collection of the paintings by the figure in the Defence Service case was forged.
Among the property that has been seized are a number of paintings that the mistress, confident of her deep knowledge of art, has acquired as masterpieces of world art.
But the art forensics commissioned by the investigators after the arrest of the paintings found that they had no artistic value and, simply, were cheap forgery,” Markin noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Department of Defense...
Afterwards, they admitted they weren't stolen from the DOD, and they said I didn't taste well.
Who has the right to talk about my taste, to talk about some personal moments?
I think it's a mess," says Vasileva.
In response to a question as to whether she pleaded guilty in any of the 12 criminal episodes she was in charge of, Vasiliev said, "Nay, of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there was no harm to the Russian Federation in question.
They're just fooling people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the UK of the Russian Federation that Vasiljev was shying away from the examination of the criminal case file, the Lawyer stated that he and his client “were not allowed to get acquainted with the case file”.
What led to the revelations of the house arresting Basileva, who was still out of touch with the press?
Maybe as a woman, she couldn't help but respond to a bad taste charge?
Or is it true that the reporters of Comsomolka, who claimed a couple of days ago that she was "into an even bigger trance under house arrest" because of the news of the reconciliation of Anatoli Serdukov with his wife and his return to the family?
A well-known military columnist of the KP, Victor Baranets, in an article on "Heartback to his wife?", wrote, "The followers do not rule out that, after such an upheaval, she may become more talkative in the interrogation."
Previously, Vasiljev has been charged with illegal sale of real property by the DOD.
Prejudice.

Do you think the travel agents went back because of the Internet?
Flight Center appears to have a reverse trend.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and is looking forward to a record profit from vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
This tourist company now expects that its main total annual profit before the tax will be between $325 million and $340 million, as compared to the previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If current targets are met, this will be a 12 to 17 per cent increase over the record return of $290.4 million in 2011-2012.
Graham Turner, the manager, said that Flight Center had made 8% of the profit in the first half of the year and began the second half of the year with good performance, especially on the weekly trips to Australia and the United Kingdom.
“Since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profit in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have record high returns in a full year before the deduction of interest and tax contributions,” he said.
“This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which tend to make us the biggest profit.”
In Australia, the entertainment business recovered in the second half of the year, compensating a slightly weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
In the United Kingdom, the Flight Center's entertainment business was also good, while corporate clients spent less.
Her business in the United States has made up for the losses sustained during the seasonally weak first half of the year, and profits are expected for the third full year in a row.
Last night, Flight Center stock rose by 3 cents to $38,20.

At the time of the audit, there was a game.
The club numbered 24 automatics.
Another game club was found in the Leninsky District on Anton Petrov Street.
There were 20 game machines used here.
The Department of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation on Barnaul states that administrative material has been prepared on the article “Illicit organization and conduct of gambling”.

In Yekaterinburg, the perp killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are looking for a criminal who has been brutally assaulted by two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
The “New Region” in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlov oblast, the day before in the Kirov district of the city of Ural, after a fire was extinguished in a three-bedroom apartment in a house on Ural Street, found the bodies of two women with signs of violent death.
The names of the dead were soon identified.
Turns out they're sisters, one of whom is a 44-year-old Jekaterinburger, the other is a 33-year-old Orenburger.
They rented a burning apartment a few days ago.
His investigation was taken under the personal control of the Chief Police Officer of the region, Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs agencies have been working on the various versions of the murder, and have tested the alibis of previously tried citizens and persons who are prone to such acts.
In addition, it is established for what purpose the women have rented the apartment and where they have lived before, what they have been doing, who they have been in a relationship with.
Schools called for more attention to math, spelling and grammar
School classes in English Literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British art literature from 1914 onward.
The examination will also include “external texts” to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English Literature and Language will be abolished.
Beginning in 2015, the student will be required to take a separate post-graduate examination in the language, with strong recommendations for the selection of English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education is due to issue new English and Mathematics curricula tomorrow, the first subject to a radical revision.
It will make changes to other core items next year.
A separate regulatory body in the field of the OFQUAL examination will present a revised structure for the secondary school final exams, with a new system of grades and a smaller number of course work.
Speaking in the summer, the Minister of Education, Michael Gove, said that there was “a wide consensus that we must reform our system of examinations to restore public trust,” insisting that the school finals would be“ more complex, more ambitious and more strict. ”
Studies show that English schools spend less time in math (116 hours a year, or 3 hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has about 138 hours in school.
While there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on the math calendar, the sources in the coalition said that the large school-level math exams, combined with the higher rate in the rating table, are likely to be an incentive to give the schools additional education in this subject.
In terms of education, more attention will be given to “the real-life task”, including financial math.
The Hayhe tickets will cost the tourists 2,200 roubles.
As of tomorrow, tourists from the Blademarks in Heiha will start transporting ships on airbags.
For those who want to go to China, this means extra costs.
The puma ticket is traditionally much more expensive than it is for a combustible.
As reported by Amurasso, the normal cost of the ticket is 2,200 roubles.
The drive through the high-comfort hall will cost 2,800 roubles.
By the way, this season didn't cost the fares: at the same price, the pumas used to transport tourists in the spring, and a year ago, in the fall.
Dmitry Medvedev: The rate of growth of the Russian Federation ' s GDP is not sufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev believes that the rate of growth of the Russian Federation ' s GDP is not sufficient, and he is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of business credit and by altering the structure of the Russian economy, with a focus on innovation, reports the Reuters.
We've been planning an increase in GDP in the area of 3% this year, maybe a little bit more.
It'll actually be a little less than 2%.
With the recession in a number of countries in Europe, it seems not very bad, but it is not enough for us, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries, and in general, a higher rate of growth is needed.
Now it's very important that Russian companies, the Russian business, get normal credit at a normal cost - that's the first thing you have to do," stressed the head of government.

Travel on dirt, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the countryside in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend with hundreds of patients.
There's not a lot of doctors in this West African country -- just one per 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 characters of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 major characters to become the hero of the year CNN.
This man will get $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father come back to life and again become unconscious, wandering over hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jameth Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but the infection had spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of himself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” Georges Bwella said.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could receive.
"It's not easy," said Bwell.
- You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bwelle died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413.
And even if the Cameroonians could go to a doctor, a lot of them would be inexpensive.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of health spending are private.
“The only problem is poverty,” Bwella said.
- And because of poverty, they can't enjoy their life."
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also set up a non-profit organization, ASCOVIME, which organizes field trips on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have provided assistance to nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 more people get into vans, tie up medical supplies to the roofs, and go to the cross-area to visit the needy villages.
It's not always their luck.
On more than one occasion, they had to push cars through rivers and dirt.
But when they come, they're greeted as real heroes: it's a holiday with songs and dances and the best spaces the locals can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed an occasion for a holiday, and Bwelle is more than happy to join the fun with a wide smile and unlimited energy.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people on every trip," he said.
They come from all over the county within a radius of 60 km of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics provides a wide range of health services on a day-to-day basis.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches, sunglasses, or free birth certificates — documents needed for school, which many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the team conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school building, a municipality or a home; after the procedure, the patients stand up and go to the post-op zone to make room for the next person.
Using the generator to light up the operating and sanitary handling of the equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers are working until early Sunday morning.
It's an inordinate pace, but the team's commitment tends to help support village musicians.
“They've been pounding drums all night to keep us awake and keep working,” he said.
On Sunday, the crew members go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, which is made up of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, has carried out 700 free surgeries over the past year, and they know that their help can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that the free hernia treatment he received would enable him to work again.
"This will change the future for me and my family," the man said.
In addition to these clinical treatments on weekends and work at the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private health clinics around Yaoundé.
It was this second job, he said, that provided 60% of the funding for his non-profit organization; the rest was covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Cathy O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bwell band.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to make money for the organization so he can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in his task, this is an opportunity for practice that they would never get at home.
"We've been able to assist in operations where we've been helping to remove blood stains or to keep Dr. Bwelle's tools," O'Malley said.
As a second-year student, you'd never get a chance like this in America.
Visitors usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often with donated medicines.
But when they arrive in Yaoundé, their food, transport, and training are paid for by Bwell.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He is giving up his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bvellé, the almost constant workload is not a major test.
Helping others to live a happy life, keeping their father’s promise, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," said Bwell.
- And I'm thinking about my dad.
I hope he can see what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh to lessen their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see how you can help.
Snowden agreed to testify about Merkel's wire.
A member of the Bundestag, Hans-Cristian Strebel, met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
In the course of the interview, it was discussed whether Snowden could be interrogated as a witness by the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office in the case of a possible wire of the German Chancellor's phone by the United States Specialized Observers.
Snowden has expressed his willingness to give the necessary evidence.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, "Gans-Christian Strebele said, "he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency, led by Keith Alexander, has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to go to Germany.
But first, we have to be clear about all the conditions for his arrival.
In the meantime, American legislators are beginning to respond to the US spying scandal.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill imposing additional restrictions on the United States electronic intelligence agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all fields and areas.
This was stated to the journalists by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Maquie, at a press conference following a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglu, reported to the Belta correspondent.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels have an interest in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all fields and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the State administrations of the two countries will provide universal assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts among themselves,” said Vladimir Makey.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions to do so and would provide the best possible assistance.
The Minister also reported that another 8th meeting of the Belarus-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission had been held in Ankara, the result of which was the signing of a protocol.
The parties have drawn up a road map for Belarus-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarus Foreign Policy Department, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, and the search for new forms and areas of cooperation.
“The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am confident that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey view each other as trustworthy partners,” he said.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Achmet Davutoglu, in turn, reported that in the negotiations, the heads of the foreign affairs agencies of the two countries had decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
In the view of the Minister, trade between Belarus and Turkey needs to be increased to $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is untapped potential in this area, he believes.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded in the future.
As well, all the necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies on the territory of Belarus and of Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey,” Ahmet Davutoglu noted.
Obama has given up on his health-care message
Among the storms of criticism, President Obama yesterday reversed his often-repeated, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health-care plan, you can keep it. ”
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people are being notified to stop providing services from their providers, the Republicans have in recent days criticized the President for misusing American society.
Yesterday, Obama made a few changes to his original public promise.
“Most people with health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in a talk in Boston.
Referring to what he called a “new news renaissance” to stop the delivery of services, Obama called on Americans who received the notices to look for other options in the marketplace.
Most people will be able to get better, more comprehensive health-care plans at the same cost or even less than expected.
"You'll get better terms," he said.
The Administration stated that it should be no surprise to anyone that 5% of the population who buys insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because they do not meet the new standards required by the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me say to these Americans: you deserve better,” said Siebelius in a speech to the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sybelius, who oversees the implementation of the law on affordable health care, said that the Internet marketplace has been "seriously bad" since October.
"I'm just as upset and angry as everyone else," she said.
- I want to get your trust back."
The irritated Cibellius dropped this phrase, which was captured by an on-line mic behind her to an aide in the room last night after a heated debate with a member of the House of Representatives, Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, about whether she was obliged to join Obama's health program.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Siebelius to say why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
Rosbalt has been decimated by the media for uncensored war.
On 31 October, Mosgorsud declared the registration license of Rosbalt to be null and void, writes Lenta.
Roskomnadzor, for systematic and gross violations of the media law, insisted on depriving the agency of media status.
In the course of the trial, an unfortunate precedent was set: the court found it possible to shut down the media, effectively denying the right to issue counter-arguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
The Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the Agency has opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has been developing and operating as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most renowned private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications has been (and is still) a note by reference to the sources of law enforcement.
Talks about the proximity of the publication to the security structures continued throughout the Agency ' s life.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had a vast source base in various departments, it was also suggested that Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Victor Čerkezov, was the head of the project.
The role of Chaplin in the Rusbalt leadership is, however, not entirely clear: it is commonly referred to as the “Project Manager”.
The director-general of the agency is Larissa Afonina, the editor-in-chief is Nikolai Ulyanov.
Lately, Rosbalt has not been on federal media ratings, either by quote or by audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the status of the Russian media on LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosebalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 hits), and the monthly number of unique visitors is about three million.
Among the most popular material in the last five months are notes of the Kremlin's helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of a soloist of the band "King and Cock", pogroms in the capital of Biryliv.
The "Rosbalt" conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when the media law was amended to prohibit uncensored war.
The agency found a prohibited dictionary in two videos published on the website ("Gigit of Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot defiled the oil towers").
The next parties are described in different ways.
Roskomnadzor, on the basis of the videos found, accused Rosbalt of a gross and systematic violation of the media law and requested the court to withdraw the licence from the agency.
In Rosbalt, it was stated that the agency's claim was not fair: first, the rollers were not editorial material, secondly, the language was masked, and thirdly, the roller was removed from the site immediately after the warning.
Agents of the agency appealed Roskomnadzor ' s claims to the Magistrate ' s Court, and when Mosgorsud accepted Roskomnadzor ' s claim on 22 October 2013, the complaints were still pending.
However, on the 25th day, the justice of the peace ruled against Rosbalt: the editor-in-chief, Nikolai Uljanov, was found guilty of a violation of the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20,000 roubles - 10,000 for each spot.
Obviously, this predetermined the outcome of the Mosgorsuda hearing - if we give up the idea that the outcome might have been premeditated earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to invalidate Rosbalt's registration certificate, effectively depriving the agency of media status.
It is not possible to say that Rosbalt was left alone in this confrontation.
The Agency supported the deputies of the State Duma (the statement to the head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Jarov, was signed on 10 October by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted at the initiative of the CPRC).
The Head of the Union of Journalists of Russia, Allvolod Bogdanov, Pavel Gusev, Chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists, and Mikhail Fedotov, Chairman of the Presidential Council for Human Rights, declared the publication to be illegal.
In fact, according to Bogdanov, Roskomnadzor’s management even gave him some assurance that it would not work until the license was revoked.
The Rossbalt trial has shown that under whose jurisdiction it is safe to be the media in Russia today is a big issue.
Syria has destroyed chemical weapons equipment.
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities, and has recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament has been completed by Damascus one day in advance of the deadline.
Prior to 1 November, Syria was to destroy production and other support facilities for the preparation of chemical warfare agents for use by handing over BBC.
The destruction of the stockpiles of poisonous substances or their chemical components is due to be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, the poisoning agents are currently in sealed vaults.
International inspectors left for Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on August 21, at the outskirts of Damascus.
The main task of the inspectors was not to lose time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent their repair.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time, the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of poisonous substances.
There are a lot of questions.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be subject to scrutiny by Western intelligence.
They would be willing to advise the inspectors on new sites for inspection if there was reason to suspect that Damascus was not fully open.
The United States believes that the shelling was carried out by regular forces.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community required the Syrian leadership, in accordance with an agreement brokered by the Russian Federation, to destroy or render out-of-work all capacities for the production of shells, poisoning gases and liquids, and to fill the shells with these substances.
Now that this phase has been completed, the next step should be the destruction of the chemical weapons that the Syrian Army has already had.
It is assumed that there may be more than 1,000 tons of neural and paralytic poisoning, fluorescent mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in a number of dozens of different locations.
For it to be destroyed, it is necessary for the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to first agree on a time-frame for action - a period of two weeks.
The OPCW Chief of Field Operations, Gerry Smith, stated to the BBC that his inspectors had “personally observed the destruction of the equipment”.
"They don't have the ability to make or mix chemical weapons anymore," he said.
The declaration of the OPCW states that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and found out that the facilities for the production of projectiles and poisonous substances had either been destroyed or had been rendered unfit.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to be inspected, as stated in the document, but the equipment from there has been transported and verified by the OPCW.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical-arms infrastructure was “especially difficult, ” as it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW won the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said it was time for the inspectors to celebrate it - they were too busy.
John Kerry, in his unparalleled admission that US espionage "has come too far."
John Kerry has shown a softening of U.S. surveillance tactics, making an unprecedented admission that in some cases US espionage “has come too far. ”
The Secretary of State also admitted to be guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being “on the autopilot” at the time of Edward Snowden’s outburst of spying by the NSA.
These leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said, "There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as the other members of the Government, have actually taken on some of the things that are going on on on the autopilot, because this was already possible, both during the Second World War and during the very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, 11 September."
He was then the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that US spying had gone too far, but he stressed that no one’s rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, this has gone too far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and to explain himself to the people, and he is now doing a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted for good reasons and that his surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We work in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is a radical extremism in the world, a senseless and determined to kill people, blow up people and attack governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, building explosions, and the killing of people, because we were able to learn about those plans in advance.
In the meantime, United States legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to the US’s alleged espionage abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorist activities with the United States, said the Chairman of the Senate’s Sub-Committee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator of Connecticut, Chris Murfi, said that he had been talking to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to the disappointment at the National Security Agency's surveillance.
“In the interest of US national security, it is indeed important for Europeans to remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorist efforts,” said the first-time Democrat of Murphy, who is the Chairman of the Senate’s International Relations Sub-Committee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I'm going to Europe to make it clear to them that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger at these NSA programs.
The news that the NSA has gathered millions of phone records in Europe has made relations worse with some US allies, even though the head of the agency has said this week that they were imprecise and reflected a misunderstanding of the meta-data that the NATO allies were collecting and shared with the US.
Other revelations cited Snowden's release of documents that show that the NSA was monitoring the German Chancellor's mobile phone, Angela Merkel, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence, James Klopper, defended allied spying as necessary and said it was a common case on both sides.
Against the background of this murmur, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit by Congress members, which was expected to take place this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and the two Chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators should be given in the coming days.
He said that the programme of the visit was still in the design stage.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to help to improve relations, he said that a degree of “best-willed hardness” would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spying programmes they have been using for years.
“As we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to accept the fact that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence,” said Murphy.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry has to go this weekend to the Middle East and to Poland to address the problems of hostility against the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence.
In the new members of the public observatories, there will be an increase in the influence of the prison staff
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new members of the Public Observatorys (ONCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote is adopted, the lobbyists will increase their influence.
The ONC is a social institution that monitors the conditions of detention.
Sergey Magnite and Leonid Razzaev's cases, the upheaval in the Copean colony - it is through the UNC that most resonant incidents are reported behind bars.
The fight between human rights defenders and the lobbyist of the silos is under way for the control of the PNC.
At the meeting of the OPC working group on the formation of the NSC, I suggested that the selection of human rights experience be a criterion.
"He was not accepted, and the lists were drawn up without the criteria," says Valery Borschev.
Borszev, the current Chairman of the Moscow Observatory and the Association of Independent Observers, is an all-Russian human rights institution dealing with prison problems.
As a member of the State of the State of the Apple, he has drawn up a law governing the work of the NNC.
The OPC Council should vote in favour of the composition of the PNC in 43 regions of the country.
There are less than 1,000 applicants for 1,800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balqaria, competitions have not been organized due to the lack of candidates.
The OPA promises to set up a pre-enlistment for the vacant seats.
The ONC of Moscow is one of the few competition commissions, despite the fact that the new 20 will be replaced by 40 participants.
According to Borszeva, in the current composition of the Capital Commission, 11 human rights defenders and 9 silovists, and in the OP version, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to join the Capital Commission.
But Vyacheslav Kalininin may be rejoined.
He has been a member of the PNC for three years, but has never visited the prisoners.
Borschev believes that by appointing a Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission, the work of human rights defenders will be unbearable, so human rights defenders do not exclude a collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, the advancement of the Silos is coordinated by ONC member Anton Blutkov, head of the “Russia Officers”, an organization that defends the interests of the security agencies.
"I don't eat babies on a tranche," said RBK dayly Anton Flowers.
He denies that he is lobbying for the promotion of any list and says he is not going to stop human rights defenders from visiting the arrested opponents.
He didn't even want to know what list was currently being voted for by the OP.
Disclosure of Borchov's information is a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is a planned change in the leadership of the Chelabin PNC.
Her former leaders will be suspended due to last year's Copean upheaval.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the management of the local commission had ignored the problems of the detainees.
On the other hand, ONC Rostova-na-Donu can move from human rights defenders to silos.
Of the new lists, a human rights defender who was the chair of the local commission “missed”, but one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber had ruled out him for unethical conduct.
The lists of the Moscow and Rostow Commissions of Borszew are considered to be a “puffer for the Copeisk”.
Tolokonnikov's revelations had no effect on Mordovia's ONC, which was considered to be a “strong one”: only one human rights defender wanted to join the new generation, and she didn't even accept the papers for the contest.
The member of the OPC, Nikolai Swanidze, told RBC daily that he had voted against the proposed list, as he was resented by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Donu.
He sent out his position to the other members of the council.
His OP colleague, Paul Gusev, says he voted in favor, as he likes the proposed Moscow list.
Co-ordinated the drawing up of ONC lists by Vladislav Grib, Deputy Secretary of OPS, who is also a member of the FSIN Institute for Research.
The Gypsy told RBK dayly that it was not right to divide the candidates for human rights defenders and silos, and did not agree that the chairmen of the commissions had the authority to obstruct the work of its members.
The fungus is not going to predict the results of the OP Council vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the amended version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
An Australian woman appeals against a prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days ' imprisonment on Phuket Island for falsely alleging that she had been assaulted by a cabbie, appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on 15 June by the Phuket Provincial Court of a false action following a report to the Thai police that a local cabbie had attacked on the night of Sunday, 10 June, while two other men held her.
However, the CCTV later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after a break-up with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket Police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.
She was held in local police cells until the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in a general-regime facility on the outskirts of Phuketa, not in an adult women ' s prison.
She is the daughter of a former Australian League player, Peter Tanks, who applied to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help to his daughter.
Tanks said to Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
“Surely, it was a worrisome time, but we hope that she will return safely to her home as soon as possible,” said Tanks.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on bail at 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently on vacation in the Krabi resort in South Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford was currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but cautioned that an appeal might result in the court extending her sentence to two years and making her serve her sentence in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also seek to reinstate its eroded tourist image, leading to acquittal.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris at the presentation of his novel, "Eltisheva", translated into French.
Let me remind you, this is his novel that became the finalist of four prizes: "The Clear Field", "The Russian Booker", "The National Bestseller" and "The Great Book."
And last year, the author of the book was awarded a cultural prize by the Government of the Russian Federation.
Roman Senchin is an undeniable leader in the generation of the present 30-year-olds and 40-year-olds.
Virtually every publication of its hard, up-to-date narratives and narratives has led to heated controversy among critics in a wide range of areas.
It can be argued that the combined articles on the prosa and publicist Senchin, the reviews of his books and journals, have created a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In the discussions on the work of “one of the most controversial modern writers”, according to critic Sergei Chuprinin, the talk is, for the most part, about what the participants refer to as the term “literary”, as the present and the future are seen not only in our words, but also in our life.
Sadly, the volume of the book has not allowed for most of the articles and reviews from regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytic and overview articles are usually presented in abbreviations under the headings "Abzazaz..."
