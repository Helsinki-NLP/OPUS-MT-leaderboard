Start.

I think Tom's sick.
Tom said he'd do it again.
Are you alone now?
Just let Tom finish his routine.
Why did Tom run?
Has he been staying here before?
Tom's afraid of Mary's dog.
You want a brace?
There's only one week left for Halloween.

Really?
Let's go now, or we'll be late.
That's your main problem.
No matter what, he's still making a fool of himself.
He fell under the table.
Tom doesn't want you to do it.
Have I changed so much?
Have you ever lived in a foreign country?
When did you get home?
It'll be hot tomorrow.

Where is the subway station?
No one knows how I feel.

Aren't you a member of the committee?

I've never heard Tom speak French.
I thought you said Tom was your brother.
Is he fair?
Tom's not telling me the truth.
Do you know this song?
I want to know exactly how Tom died.
Life can be so unfair.
I don't plan on doing it anymore.
Tom has full money in the bag.
You fool!
I loved Lila's sister.
I bought this book for ten dollars.
Tom's a lot older than he looks.

They all came back to see Tom.
Where's Dad?
After that, he took off his glasses.
The short hair is very good for her.
Tom's got it.
Take the chicken before you get it ready.
I was relieved to say everything I wanted to say.
I got Tom a sweater.
It's done like this.
I love cats.
Are you looking for something specific?
Whose fault is this?
No one's stopping you.
Tom wants to join the team.
You're too skinny.
Come here.
There's a map on the wall.
You're very pretty.
I'm here to see you.
What's your favorite pizza stuff?
The last point of view has many supporters in Japan.
You don't think you could do that?
I don't know what I can do for you.
Tom's smart.
He's irritating.
If you go, I'll miss you.
Point the smart guy to a mistake, and he'll thank you, point the bad guy to a mistake, and he'll offend you.
That's a great idea.
I don't think there's anything in there.
Make your point.
They don't know us.
Tom probably forgot to tell Mary about it.
Do you happen to know where Tom lives?
I'm gonna ask Tom for dinner.
Maybe I'll do it again.
Do you really think I'd do it?
It's a lie.
The war took happiness from them.
I'd like to have enough money to get a car.

I'm wondering if Tom can do it.
We're sure we're gonna do this.
His home country is Germany.
It's an orange.
He's an atheist.
What's your aunt doing?
I was playing with the champ.
Tom warned you this might happen.
In fact, I don't agree with you.
Mary said she believed it.
When do you leave?
I have a lot of friends.
I wish I could stay here forever.
After lunch, she always has time.
The land has a smaller part of the earth’s surface.
I have a twin.
We begged Tom not to go there.
I think we may have been too aggressive.
You're big.
I have a bit of free time.
I'll help you tomorrow.
This story has entertained me.
Watch out for your head!
I'll miss you.
Take this.
Tom asked you to do something?
Tom's dog's name is Cookie.
I just changed the password.
I didn't do anything like that.
It took me about three hours to read the book.
The tooth fairy is a tooth thief.

Do you know what kind of blood group Tom has?
I've never been to Europe.
Tom's trying to avoid an argument with Mary.
They'll get it.
There's only one shop all over the island.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do it.
Tom's deeply confused.
Is anyone here?
Don't call me.
It's better to die standing up than to live on your knees.
Tom's waiting.
Everybody likes Tom.
I knew you'd be waiting for us.
I can't forget her.
They have chosen a new government.
Please wait five minutes.
I don't want to talk to Tom.
Bring me a clean plate and take the trash.
Tom told me he was on his own.
Here's the church we got married to.
I don't think Tom's gonna be here.
I think it makes sense.
I hope you don't get too disappointed.
He was popular with the polls.
Tom didn't give up the French bill.

Dance.
I have a great teacher.
He needs to be killed.
What are we gonna eat tonight?
Have you found them yet?
You have to give her more time.
What are you doing with this?
She's hard on it.
You're such an idiot!
My dad bought me a book.
Tom's energy-intensive.
So a lot of things didn't like it.
Tom knew Mary wouldn't be busy.
Dry sand absorbs water.
You always loved Tom, didn't you?
Here you go!
Tom says he can't win.
I'm not doing this.
Tom didn't seem offended.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
You want me to get you a glass of water?
Tom told me he thought Mary was ugly.
She smiled at me.
You know what they are.
I don't think you're heartless.
It was built for ages.
He passed the test.
Whose friend are you?
Tom's too tired to be busy.
Tom threw Mary the ball.
Tom's pretty persuasive, isn't he?
I miss talking to them.
He tried not to cry.
They're sorry.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
Who told you I did it?
It's never too late.
Leave me alone, I'm sleeping.
Aren't you ready for more?
Tom has no idea why Mary lied.
Tom's looking for a job.
Father will be back in a few days.
Is it true that Midori is a very good violin player?
Well, that explains it.
You're a big optimist, aren't you?
Every student has a locker.
I'll ask for an account, please.
I'll see my uncle tomorrow.
You're the most important person in my life.
I hope Tom changes his mind.
I forgot to give you my phone number.
Cottons are green.
I'll do my homework by 9:00.
Where were you born?
You said you and Tom had a fight?
Your laces are off.
The book was well sold in Japan.
I like to dance.
All of us have found out about these facts.
Tom's mad at you, right?
I'd like to be a well-known football player.
Did I snore?
Tell us something.
I'm glad you're doing this.
Since I didn't get the answer, I texted her again.
What would you like to say about this?
You think it's a trap?
People, stop killing each other.
I was wondering if Tom and Mary were planning to do it.
I borrowed a car from Tom.
I don't think I could spend six hours alone with you.
There's almost no furniture.
I'm ready to go, but Tom isn't.
I feel like a different person.
Whatever happens, I'll stay with you.
They used to kill a llama every day to please the sun god.
He's a drinker.
Don't tell me I didn't warn you.
He died so that we could live.
This photographer is very talented.
Write to Tom.
Thomas warned me about the danger.
Alice is a member of Satan’s temple.
When was the last time you bought shoes?
You're surrounded.
What do you and Tom want to do?
Tom didn't poison Mary.
She cried, reading the letter.
You have to tell the truth.
You can be right.
This one looks better.
He's eating now.
You gave me your word.
I want Tom to wait.
We're here!
Is that irritating you?
What's in the box?
It's still hot.
Tom treated Mary like a kid.
Why are you so sad?
I was just doing it for fun.
Tom refused to say anything.
Mother sent you milk and pies.
I just met someone I think I can fall in love with.
Are you saying you don't want to help us paint the table?
I'm not gonna tell anyone your secret.
Look at this.
I've never been to Florida.
You're too thin.
We've been talking for hours.
I'm very drunk.
Tom told me he thought Mary was a trust.
Do you agree with their decision?
Put it on my account.
The dot sat the eggs for one week.
You look good with short hair.
Tom's in Boston.
Tom and I went to the concert.
Tom had a stroke.
Why did you ask Tom to do it, since you knew he couldn't do it?
Did you see him come out?
Can I talk to Mrs. Brown?
He lived in the center of London.
What was inside?
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
What do you like better, summer or winter?
Don't you plan on doing this?
Happily, no one got wet.
No one knows who killed Tom.
It's not as hard as you think.
Why are you mad at me?
Let's go get drunk.
You need to wait.
Tom has a lot of friends.
What have you been doing today?
I don't know what he knows.
Hey, everybody!
Can I open the can?
I'm trying to get some rest.
You must be Tom's brother.
Tom fell in love with the characters of his novel.
I think you heard me.
Tom's home with his kids.
Tom is very rich.
Tom inflated the ball.
Where's the phone?
We're a twin brother and a sister.
I was in the toilet myself.
I hope you'll like it.
Have you ever seen Tom and Mary do it?
I haven't seen Tom in years.
Her five.
Your word to God in the ear!
Tom's coming next week.
You need to stop doing this just now.
My grandpa is talking very slowly.
Did you win?
She can speak English pretty well.
I have to go.
Tom didn't seem too concerned.
Tom says he's planning on doing it.
What he did was not wrong.
Can you give me a minute?
Do you have anything cold to drink?
I need to talk to them.
They're too big.
We'll give you another chance.
I could have done it.
Zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
He's a medical student.
That's not necessarily the case.
I know Tom.
Tom's not a very good teacher.
Where do you all live?
He was talking about himself.
Let's set up a tent while the light's still on.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary's car.
We'll get another chance.
Tom's car was confiscated and sold to a new owner.
I hid under the bed.
There's one problem.
I don't remember exactly what Tom said.
Why are you back here?
The room is warming up.
Tom can play the guitar, I think.
We've seen it.
Tom never breaks a promise.
The chicken's not cooked.
I think I'm gonna play Tennis with Tom.
I was out.
I forgot to do what Tom asked me to do.
I really want to go to Boston.
Let's rest.
I really loved her.
Tom, in fact, came early.
I want to have a cup of tea.
What does your father do?
I'm a loser.
Do you know my wife?
Tom began to learn French.
Tom's lost in the frost.
Don't eat any good words.
Stop squeezing that swing of spades!
I told Tom.
I had lunch three hours ago.
This must be a joke, right?
There was an accident at work with Tom.
You're not sad, are you?
We have half a dozen eggs.
Tom refused to go.
She got a cup of coffee.
Tom repeated what Mary said.
So it was thirteen when he died.
Good luck to you.
He used to read a lot.
What do you think really happened?
My mom put it on the table.
Please bring me a clean knife.
Mary's tolerable, isn't she?
You think Tom's part of the problem?
Tom didn't want to go for a walk.
Tom's waiting for me at the station.
I'm putting the tips to my coffee.
I can't stand this sound anymore.
Please don't go yet.
I was amazed by Tom’s sincerity.
I read the letters you sent me.
Have you ever seen an accident?
I know you're joking.
You want to learn how to play guitar?
I didn't want to dance.
Wait, I'll pay for it.
We are confident of his success.
The gods punish the sinner.
Have you ever duplicated the Statue of Liberty?
I have an idea.
I just got some fries.
I'm too late for Tom.
This party is boring.
Why did you come home today?
Aren't you a musician?
Don't you want me to do something?
Tom can't change it.
Would you want Tom to do this to you?
Did you know Tom was single?
Mary is my older sister.
He finally made it.
It's too expensive!
The number's ready.
I want it now.
Tom, I want to stay with you.
I don't like to borrow money from anyone.
We're teachers.
We're in the evacuation zone.
She sank in the lake.
You need to stop doing this.
That's a good question.
Mom, can I go for a swim?
You think I'm crazy?
This bus is on its way to Minskaya.
I need to find them now.
My mom likes to eat homemade cheese.
Nothing new.
I love her.
Would you like to have some dinner with me?
I totally agree.
Is that what you're gonna say?
You want a banana?
We have to be at work by 9:00.
We all slept.
I haven't washed my hands yet.
What?
Tom went to see Mary.
I have the money.
I thought Tom understood.
Do you have a big family?
I'm a tax payer.
In his right hand, Tom has a pen.
There's a lot of coffee.
I'm glad you're okay.
Tom recognized me.
You're lying.
Tom followed Mary on the street.
It was Tom kissing Mary, not John.
I have other plans for you.
Do you see Tom?
I like to ride my bike.
The bullet found her purpose.
Tom ran to catch up with Mary.
How can I help?
Tom was found guilty and sentenced to death.
It'll be our secret.
What time did you go to bed last night?
I'm not getting married to you.
Doing this would be risky.
I don't want to be punished.
I'm not a green pepper at all.
The meat suffocated horribly.
My sister's started the latrines.
I'm just trying to help.
It's my dictionary.
Tom and I both got tired.
Thomas sings all day.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
I'm wondering if it's actually working.
What are they up to?
Revenge is a dish that is served coldly.
She's your queen.
I asked Tom what to do.
I don't think Tom can ride a single-wheeled bike.
I'm too low.
They had guns.
I doubt Tom would ever decide to consider going to Australia.
It's in the context.
That's my dog.
Tom's been working all day.
Does it matter?
Tom's eyes are not used to the darkness, so he didn't see anything.
You can't smoke in this room.
He'll be here tomorrow.
I hate that picture.
I smelled it.
Don't you get tired?
I'm praying.
The polishing tool is very stinky.
Russian is considered a complex language.
Thank you for telling me the truth.
He sprained his ankle.
Tom told me to do it.
Are you sure Tom's gonna do this?
After she finished her work, she went home.
Who wants to come with me?
Tom said it wouldn't be hard to do.
It seems that there are too many Turkish trolls on Dad.
Why are you barking?
Is this just a coincidence?
Tom may not know where Mary is.
Nothing works.
Tom's still playing golf, right?
How could you let him do this to you?
What did you say to Tom?
She's right next door.
Don't drink too much.
Can you give me an answer?
What happened on October 20th?
I don't think Tom was involved.
If you have any questions, let me know.
I'll deal with Tom.
I want to kiss you.
He's been very busy all day.
Tom will come back, I'm sure he will.
He managed to escape.
I wonder what Tom's thinking.
Tom will bring Mary.
None of us speak French.
She saw him drinking a branch.
You have to say because you can't do it.
Tom's a lot late.
Tom's good at speaking French.
Tom said he couldn't find anything to eat.
It's a good day.
The fashion is changing fast.
I'm completely confused.
I couldn't see who it was.
Last year, there was a bad harvest.
Tom betrayed you.
I was stoned.
Tell me, please, where are the eggs?
Tom is a friendly boy.
He's at lunch right now.
Eucariotic cells have a nucleus.
It's already starting.
I still have the key to Tom's house.
She's been talking about her foreign experience for a long time.
They're all hungry.
Don't be so alarmed.
Jesus is exhausting me.
Be reasonable.
It frightens me.
You really need to help Tom do it.
Mary says she won't do it.
We're gonna vote today.
They didn't have any food.
Religion of one age is the literal permission of the next.
I think we'll be back soon.
What a disaster!
I made you an apple pie.
Mary's lower than Tom.
Abraham Lincoln is a prominent man.
Tom has no enemies.
She's afraid to go abroad.
I was born like this.
Please correct it.
Why are you talking to Tom French?
I've done some work.
I wasn't allowed to see her.
Did Tom sleep well?
Tom and Mary told John.
The elevator didn't work.
You're good.
There's no one here but me.
Tom didn't want to do this to you.
I saw you on TV.
Mother Fawl's been married for the second time.
He's got ten cows.
I like English.
You're cruel.
Looks like the fall's here.
I saw a man go to the room.
He's anything but a fool.
I was afraid it might happen.
Who else was at the meeting?
He's talking too fast.
Tom offered Mary a pretty good job.
Will Tom help you?
She's got a good face.
Tom didn't want it.
This guy can't tell what is right from what is wrong.
You're a panda.
I'm not sure where my hotel is.
What kind of candy do you like?
I almost forgot it was his birthday.
What keeps you so late?
Layla blamed Fawla for dating other women.
Go with Tom.
I thought he'd come alone.
Tom Jackson is my boss.
This is my brother.
Can you tell me where I can find the hotel?
I'm kidding.
I think I've put some good questions.
Okay, I have to make a suggestion.
Lithuania is a member of the European Union.
He was acquitted.
I taught my wife to drive.
I stopped doing it.
Who's your fabulous figure?
The teacher remarked to us that we should be quiet.
What's the real reason Tom's not here?
Stop twisting my words.
Tom has vanished untraceable.
Tom's asking us to help him.
I'm from Denmark.
I love clouds.
I'm not your slave.
Put your stuff down.
Am I right?
I don't go to church anymore.
My name is Henry.
Tom knows he has to go on.
Tom won't take the car to Boston.
I'm still afraid to do it.
I don't want to do it alone.
Tom didn't know he had a secret supporter.
Tom's following Mary.
I still don't like Tom very much.
So we'd better stay at home.
Tom seems to be smoothing.
Did you know Tom?
Tom said he had a lot of friends in Boston.
The food's getting out.
Tom and Mary are fine.
I can see myself in the mirror.
It would be good to see Tom again.
It's 10 minutes on the bus to the station.
Why isn't Tom planning on doing this?
Tom eats a lot.
Tom's taller than me.
That's what I didn't think of.
I poked.
In Washington, D.C., cherry blooms.
Do you know a good restaurant?
Tom was the oldest in our class.
He's three years older than her.
What if our plan doesn't work?
Here's the water.
You're always careful.
Tom didn't expect anyone.
I have to go to the station to get on the last train.
I don't get it, and I'm not used to not getting it.
I've been listening to jazz all morning.
Tom used to hang out with Mary and John.
The girl in white, - my fiancee.
Tom's out.
The door opens at the 2nd of the 30th day.
I want you to talk to Tom about his behavior.
I'm not in love with Leila.
He was only fourteen.
I'll teach you to play check-in.
The moon is up.
Whatever it is, I just can't accept it.
Did you find a problem?
Who's gonna go?
Tomorrow's the weekend.
Tom's pretty shy, right?
We found out that Tom had an accident.
I hope you'll be back.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?
You told me to do it.
Tom and Mary are rivals.
Tom wants me to apologise.
Try not to cry.
You've got a very sharp ear.
Can we do it again?
Are your kids still sleeping?
You have to try again.
Is Tom Christian?
I want to see what happens.
Tom sat in front of Mary.
I have less money than you do.
Tom lives in Boston, right?
He's an office man.
You think Tom's gonna win, right?
Could you stop, please?
They followed you.
I'm waiting for your answer.
Tom didn't have any scuffles.
Tom's room is closed.
Of course I do.
Please do it fast.
He agreed with me.
Can you show me the way to the port?
What did you do last night?
Tom is a good doctor.
Don't you want this job?
Tom said he needed to buy something to eat.
Tom thinks Mary's innocent.
I waited in the rain for at least ten minutes.
I wonder if Tom already told Mary she needed to do it.
Are you using modern technology?
You reworked.
Tom's in his room.
Did you see anyone but Tom last night?
Is this a solid list?
Don't stick to the fence.
Will it rain again today?
I don't know what Tom promised.
You ready to go?
Please take off your shoes.
We need some money.
I knew all about it.
Do I have to do this now?
Kate's trying to go on top of it.
On the Internet, no one knows you're a cat.
The girl twins are so similar, I can't tell them.
Tony broke it.
What's the delay?
It was easy to answer.
Thank you for the information.
I have a right to know the truth.
I can't prove it.
Where can I get my luggage?
Tom said he was hoping Mary could win.
Wake up the kids.
We've been drinking a lot.
Who else did you tell?
Tom lost his voice.
Is this your beer?
Security is not guaranteed.
I didn't see them.
Tom's gonna dance.
Give me your wallet.
You don't have anything.
Even a teacher can make a mistake.
We were disappointed in it.
Tom may be dead.
I'm gay.
Why am I so tired?
Wait for the end of my exams.
How many kids do you have?
I'm not done with Tom yet.
There are thousands of pastafarians in Ukraine.
You're very persistent, aren't you?
I didn't testify.
We need to do it fast.
Does anyone know the name of the deceased?
Here's the news.
Have you read this book?
You're not tall enough.
I just got back from school.
I have nothing to do with it.
Do you like Japanese food?
I'm sorry Tom thinks so.
You look astonished.
Wow, it looks good.
You ever got stuck in an elevator?
The operation can't wait.
What time did this happen?
Don't try to do it on your own.
There were no survivors.
They've lost a DNA sample.
If I had time, I'd go to Tom.
Put it on the box.
Tom can't come.
I don't know where Tom is.
Your prophecy has come true.
The macros for jEdit are written on BeanShell.
Do you want to come to the concert with us?
Is this a fire car?
All food and drink are good and good, but you need to know time, place, and measure.
I think it's a good app.
I wonder if she'll recognize me after all these years.
I'm sometimes very negligent.
I know you don't trust us.
I didn't kill anyone.
I don't think Tom's gonna be in Australia next week.
Tom had to wait.
You ate.
I haven't seen him in about three years.
I'm afraid I won't finish the report on time.
It's unlikely I'll be there tonight.
I don't trust you.
It travels the world.
Boys are fine.
I wonder if Tom told Mary she had to do it.
Tom said, why would he need the money?
You're good.
What does it look like?
I don't live in Boston anymore, I moved to Chicago.
It only happened once.
You can see Mount Fuji from here.
Man-like apes are smart.
The festival has already begun.
Does your father know about this?
Tom is photogenic.
Please don't interrupt me for a while.
The man tried to install his own antenne.
They don't even know why.
Liar!
Well, maybe you're right.
The institution is a waste of time.
Tom sat down at his sister's wedding.
Do you know where Tom is?
That cat is very sweet.
Give me something to write.
I really like Tom.
We don't have a class tomorrow.
I want to learn Hebrew.
There's an orange on the table.
Never leave me alone with Tom.
Mary does whatever she's told to do, Tom.
It's a very good movie.
Why is no one answering?
Tom told me he thought he had a griep.
My blood's soaked.
You gave me good advice.
This bike doesn't belong to Tom.
I thought you lost my watch.
I don't remember you at all.
These houses are my uncle.
I just did my job.
No one called tom.
No one knows what's gonna happen.
We're always waiting for something.
Thank you for your attention.
I didn't apologize.
Many young people in this summer went to Hawaii.
Tom is my twin brother.
At this point, there are no comments.
Tom, I want to stay with you.
Do not resist.
You're gonna pay for this!
Do you understand me?
Tom's been cut.
Tom thinks Mary can do this?
Is this your hat?
Remember, you're a gunpowder.
You want me to go with you?
Is it white?
You love the rose, you have to endure the thorns.
Do you like coconut water?
Barcelona is located in Spain.
He's very sensitive.
There's only one cookie left.
I wanted to see this movie with you.
I learned to dive at the age of five.
Tom's afraid he can hurt Mary's feelings.
Tom tried to save Mary.
I'm on time.
Where's your bag?
She got out of the company.
She'll try it again.
They found bear tracks on the snow.
My friends think that pastafarianism is a joke.
Do as I say, not as I do.
Tom always has the sweetest picture in his profile.
I got in a cab.
Sport is always easy for him.
Well, whatever it is, it won't surprise me.
You'll be sorry about that.
Tom was on his way here at about the next 30.
The cat was protecting her kittens.
It's not his handwriting.
You can say anything.
That's enough for one day.
Tom gave Mary his heart.
I don't think Tom will remember me.
He speaks German.
Tom's not as busy as you are.
Why do you need so many shoes?
You're very brave.
I'm totally hollow.
No one has ever heard of my country.
He became a national hero.
Tom said, where did he do it?
We're learning Chinese.
How do I get on the other side?
Do we have a choice?
There's no way.
Let me see.
Tom began to realize what was going on.
Promise me you'll come.
Take off your coat.
He's running to the station every morning.
They're running out of food.
Not here.
No one was content.
I hope so.
I'm such an idiot.
I was trying to sleep.
Tom's always online.
I moved here from Boston.
Tom just sent me a text message.
So somewhere in this building.
We're open tomorrow.
I didn't expect such a turn of events.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
I asked him what his name was.
When do you want to go?
There's got to be some logic.
Did you work last night?
How did you convince Tom to help us paint the cliff?
Have you been to Washington, D.C., U.S. capital?
Mary kept her balance.
I'm just lucky.
They're very subject.
It's a print.
I was wondering if Tom was mad or not.
I have to get ready for the test.
The plane went east.
Don't let him touch it.
Tom says he's your friend.
The Russians watch TV!
He called me.
He invited her to the concert.
What does a suspect look like?
No one would have been able to stop it.
Tom died of hunger.
It's good to have you here.
I let the cat in.
I left your parachute on the bus.
The bus is in the kids' room.
Does this animal eat humans?
You're a vegetarian?
Do you want to live forever?
Listen to what I have to say.
He'll be here soon.
Can't you pick me up?
I'm not pregnant.
He didn't break up.
I have a question.
There's not enough!
Tom said Mary was probably still doing it.
I'm not sure I agree with him.
The boss let me go early today.
What time is the end of the world?
I'm never worried.
How sweet!
When I'm in bad humour, I start to sing.
I don't owe him anything.
Where's your key?
Tonight's gonna be pretty cold.
I'm not gonna ask Tom for help.
How much you paid to do it.
You don't have to stay.
One day we'll meet again.
You said you wouldn't do it.
It was a long flight.
Don't tell anyone.
I've got to go.
I was disintegrated.
Tom outdid me.
How many people have died?
Did these guys do something to you?
Mike's a member of the swim group?
Tom is following orders.
You're not listening.
They didn't find anything.
Don't get caught.
I'm Antonio.
This land belongs to the royal family.
Are those rumors true?
We really want it, don't we?
Finally, he decided to make her an offer.
Tom Anitrix was not astonished that Mary was so good at speaking French.
I know you're here.
It's half a third now.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
There is no great hope.
It's not mine.
What exactly do you want, Tom?
We're almost done.
So we have to be home by 2:30.
You go to school on foot?
Is that Tom's girl?
Tom's wasting his time.
Molecule is made up of atoms.
We know that.
Now is not a good time.
Do you have time to have lunch with me?
I'm sorry he didn't come to the meeting.
Where do you live now?
You know, he's just been through a hard time.
Tom got married to a neighbor.
My head hurts.
Repeat, please.
I'll be with you in a second.
I'm learning English.
It's a good weather, isn't it?
Come if you can.
I hate it!
You're a little too young for me.
Tom's too old for you.
Tom said he was hoping Mary would do it.
Tom didn't look out.
My parents just arrived at the station.
I shook my hand.
This year you bought a Christmas present for Tom?
He's got something to do with this robbery.
My whale looks sad.
Tom and Mary only eat those vegetables that grow themselves.
Tom showed his driver's license to the police.
Show me what's in your pocket.
She's packed the pieces of the broken dishes.
When does it start?
Tom felt good.
What have you learned today?
I work on my own.
Tom's team scored 96 points. 55 points in the first half. How many points in the second half?
Your shoes are right here.
We're on our way home.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
I'll be back in less than five minutes.
You don't kiss well enough.
I'd like to order a sandwich.
Tom gave me a gift.
Where's Dad?
Who else helped you?
I'd love to help you.
Are you over 18?
The dog's trying to run.
Tom can't read.
I just got a boat.
Tom didn't know Mary was in love with him.
Tom's disgusting.
The pharmacy is on Fresno Street.
Tom's your uncle, isn't he?
Are you ready to hear the bad news?
I talked to them.
Has Lucy phoned yet?
Looks like Tom.
You don't have to do this if you don't want to.
I was just about to wash up.
Fun!
Did Tom mention any problems?

I gave up on this offer.
Mary has already done what she had to do.

You've been saving a table?
Where did the money go?
My grandpa was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.

What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's time for supper.
It's unlikely Tom will forget how it's done.
Drinking?
Will Tom do it with you?
You're not sleeping?
The meeting began at 5:00 p.m.
Mary said she likes to do it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I've only been to Tokyo once.
I got the electricity bill.
What color is his steward?
Last week, I bought a new car.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be okay.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom was planning to do it.
The presence of all members is an obligation.
Don't you feel good?
You've underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee cost two euro.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning on doing this with?
We are content with the decision.
This back is cheap.

All right, I'll eat it.
I don't want to.
Do you know what colors she likes?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here tonight.
Tom opened a restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I'm jealous of your good health.
Yes, with pleasure!
She began to play an old song.
Why do they speak French?
It's a lie.
There is no pyramid in Europe.
It's spring soon.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me this?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom's very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.

What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I have a lot of time.
Let yourself be happy.
She wants to wait for her wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need the facts.
She couldn't defend herself.

He's a strange person.
I just got my hair cut.
Mary said she'd never learnt French.
I think I'm gonna buy a new car.
We're responsible.
You're so sweet.
It's gonna cost about $15.

His theory is worth the attention.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help was too late.
This is not a new problem.

Can I have your phone number?
You need to stop.
Tom's gonna go to Boston.
Who said you can do this?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is 10 minutes behind.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Talk quietly.
The sun is bright in the day, and the moon in the night.
I got up on it.
You've been right before.
I hope Tom can help us.
You have a right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I have a problem with my boss.
It's a banana.
Tom will probably be punished for what he's done.
Mary is your girl?
London has dampened the mist.

Do you usually go abroad?
You have to be flexible.
I believe you'll win.
She went to the airport to escort him.
Get out of the way.

How's your wife, Tom?
I'll take your offer.
Bill has a lot of friends.
That would be unfair.
It's either you or Jane.

I shouldn't have come here.
Tom's clean, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such an idiot.
Did Tom give you something for me?
I would never have been able to do this without your help.
I always have coffee and pots for breakfast.
I'm hungry, 'cause I didn't eat.
I'm the best.
How'd your exam go?
Can I pay you later?
Did this just happen?

Where is Boston?
I need your opinion.
Don't worry, she doesn't understand German.
Is she hiding something?
Tom said he was curious.
I have a good appetite today.
We're quiet in our new house.
There are only two things in the world, the universe, and man's stupidity, and I can't be sure about the first.
She said, "I'm very happy."
It's interesting to talk to Tom.

I love you.
Which one do you live on?
Tom was a bit confused.
He signed the check.
Hey, how you doing?
The password is "Muiriel."
Did you hear what Tom said?
Tom's a novel reader.
Take the trash out.
You're my friend.
He's got two cars.
They realized.
No problem!
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
May I borrow your knives?
Thank her for her help.

What do you do about it?
I'm meeting her demands.
Forget about this sad event.
Please take this.

Tell me the truth, please.
We ordered too much food.

Tom loves Mary very much.
Tom's cooking supper.
The dog himself is smart.
I can't get the photos out of the camera!
I was amazed to know what I won.
I was wondering if Tom told Mary she should do it.
But that doesn't mean all the animals are dogs.
Those who can think of just one way to write a word are obviously lacking in imagination.
I'm sure of his success.
Tom didn't do it.
Where's the nearest metro station?
Tom ran out of the window.
You're not hiding anything?
How are you?
I didn't know it was gonna happen.
I have a lot of friends.
You can just do it now.
There's no speed limit.
Tom's a little red.
That's what you have to do.
I probably need to spend some time with Tom.
Do you know how to drive a car?
How did you know this was gonna happen?

Did Tom bring someone to the party?
It's Christmas.
It's an avalanche.
You said it was important.
Can you help me?

I think they're students.
I just want to say you've done your job well.
I think you've said enough.
I'm a client.
I'm very greedy.
You're crazy.
Tom won't be bothering Mary any more.
Just answer it now.
I thought Tom was missing the house.
Tom hasn't done it since last year.
You're done complaining?
Aren't you Mary's husband?

No one's seen Tom.
The police continued their investigation.
I think I know what Tom would do.

So, what do you suggest?
I've never been to America.
I don't want to die.
We just found a murder weapon.
I'm waiting for your help.
Don't touch that blue button.
Did Tom get in touch with you?
"This boy, he's so clever," Mary said.
He once loved her.
He likes football.
Birthdays are important.
Here's your key.
You don't like to go for a bath?
What time can you come?
Tom says he's expecting Mary to do it.
Drop Tom the ball.
Tom's trying to figure out what to do to him.
Is that positive news?
We're not very hungry yet.
You see Tom's boat?
Tom doesn't do everything he can.
I'm sure you'll find a good job.
You're skinny.
Tom doesn't trust the police.
Perhaps this world is the hell of another planet.
He picked up a butterfly, clinging it between his big and pointing fingers.
This cookie tastes good.
Women are so queer!
I've already considered this idea.
Tom hit me in the head.
Am I blocking something?
I know how to ski.
Do what they tell you to do.
I'm looking for you.
Some people didn't want to fight.
Do you know why Tom isn't drinking?
His book inspired me.
I don't believe Tom's coming back.
I was measuring my hat.
Tom's getting old fast.
Tom said I look terrible.
I had a bit of an argument with Tom.
"When you get back?" "All depends on the weather."
Am I a holocaust?
It's a Scottish name.
Is a hot dog a sandwich?
Thank you for yesterday.
Don't you see that that's why you need your help?
I'm not a soldier.
Tom's wife told me he wasn't at home.
I bought Tom a watch.
I didn't say anything.
Don't hit me.
Tom usually wears a tie to work.
The man who helped me was Tom.
I'm going out.
The dog's name is Ken.
I was fair.
When did I lie?
I think Tom's a friend.
We didn't have much time.
I like to play cards.
He's a slut.
What's a computer?
I'm not ignorant.
Did you sing it yourself?
What do you suggest?
Tom decided to do it.
Your meds are ready.
I thought you were curious.
Well, everyone's his own, right?
I was so excited I couldn't sleep.
Tom's alive.
I was nervous.
Tom recently changed his job.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.
Tom was sad.
She was a foreigner, and she was treated like a foreigner.
Karen went there on her own.
Do I seem nervous?
The girl we saw waiting for someone outside Tom's house was Mary.
Why don't you quit smoking?
We all make mistakes.
He asked himself why his wife left him.
I think I put too much sugar.
Do you know how to ride a mat?
I know how it's done.
Tom ate?
I don't have to cook dinner tonight.
I have something to say.
The hotel can receive 300 people.
I baked so much pie.
He can ask questions and answer them.
Tom said he's got an ally.
Tom has two girlfriends.
What's Tom doing in Boston?
Tom didn't think Mary would want to do it.

I have a lot of time.
One more thing, please.
I'm a member of the team.
I had a stroke last year.
My mom's busy making dinner.
Horses are good animals.
Hurry up and come back.
He's incompetent.
Thomas was working out.
He's unbearable.
He's sure he's going to have an exam.
Tom was voting for the offer.
Tom told you how long it took him to do it?
Let's get started!
Attention!
I'm exhausted.
The outlook is not too bright.
I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I'm fascinated by the Devil's literal peonage.
The problem is, she's not experienced enough.
I spent a while in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary called their kid John.
I wonder if Tom is actually gonna go to Mary's concert.
Tom said he spent the past weekend with this?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us to sing.
Let's not do anything.
Tom wants his dad to be buried next to his mother.
You don't think we'd notice?
Your supper was so tasty!
I just found a solution to the problem.
Tom promised me he wouldn't.
I'm a di-jay.
I hate Christmas.
Was the money enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It's too expensive.
A child has been lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn how to hold back.
We're okay.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows a lot of people.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We're gonna lose.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Talk to me.
The surface of an airball is a non - Euclidean space, so it is not subject to euclide geometry.
Conversations have been successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I tried to call you.
I've never killed anyone.
Be honest and honest.
There is always hope.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're twice my age.
The reporter was kidnapped by terrorists.
I missed the ball.
I hate this city.
Now he lives in Tokyo.
Programming languages are his hobbies.
I'm glad to hear it.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How many watches do you have in your house?
Tom's deaf.
So you don't like to eat fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
Tom is very proud of you.
Your doctor says you're gonna be okay.
You're a panda.
You want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need that money.
My stew is orange.
Is Tom still crying?
So I'd like to be taller.
I have to help my mom.
His book inspired me.
Are you brothers?
It's not my idea.
You have a plan, don't you?
He's out.
Tom's out of town.
I'm not wearing my shoes.
Next year's gonna be worse.
Mary in the yellow dress.
Love has a bitter scent.
The meeting was over.
You should have done it last year.
I thought I couldn't do it.
I have an old car.
We know why.
I go every year.
I felt helpless.
I like the teacher.
Let's take the elevator.
Tom is a professional hockey player.
We went to the woods to look for insects.
These chairs are different.
I saw her a week ago.
A small flavor of coffee cost two euro.
Motherly love is more than anything.
He was persecuting a thief.
I worked at a restaurant.
I'm not strong enough.
Doing this won't be as boring as you think.
He accidentally put the salt in his cup of coffee.
Tom forgot to tell you.
I'm interested in music.
I really don't want to eat now.
The fragments of the mirror were scattered on the floor.
You're so queer.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a wonderful car!
She skipped school.
Tom sat by the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
Tom doesn't think I have to do this.
Public debt is on the rise.
Why am I me, not you?
Tom's probably never gonna do it.
It's a doll.
Get out of here!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I read this story in a book.
Tom still has a bike?
You have to be short.
Tom's smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do it.
I'm a teacher.
You played well, didn't you?
I was born in Osaka in 1997.
You have a good voice.
It's important you understand.
Tom won't do it.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends a lot of time on the Internet.
You're adorable.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's go meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't help it.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom goes in thirty minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car to.
We can talk.
The computer can count very fast.
You're not needed.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
What's the weather?
I am 30 years old.
Tom won't bother you any more.
Do you want some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What have you been eating for lunch today?
You can't even change a diaper.
Do people still use Webcams?
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she left school.
This word is borrowed from the Greek.
Am I gonna die?
I'm dying so I want to see them.
The brother is sick.
Don't push.
The car's out.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.
Mary lost her money.
There are no rules.
Layla got pregnant very quickly.
He's not a liar.
Do you know how to make a salad out of raw fish?
Tom knew he knew Mary.
Tom cooks breakfast.
No doubt it will rain.
Tom didn't mention Australia.
Apparently, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
We actually went to Boston.
There are many volcanoes in Iceland.
John is two years older than me.
For the best, or worse, TV has changed the world.
I'm a bit fat.
He was easy to answer my question.
What's the purpose of your trip?
Tom's looking for something.
He must be innocent.
I love kids.
Who's left?
When does she come?
That's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm very glad I did it yesterday.
Tom still lives next to you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw the rocks.
Does she have a dog?
I was a sorcerer.
Don't interrupt me when I talk.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you meet him a lot?
You'd like Tom.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She's got wine.
You're gonna stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm so sorry.
They made mistakes.
How do you know I grew up in Boston?
This is a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was in the 2000s.
Tom's probably gonna do it.
It has to be the right color.
Tom has a very strict mom.
After a short peace, war again erupted.
It's best not to trust Tom.
Just talk to Tom.
Can I remind you of your promise?
The capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What's the name of this restaurant?
Excuse me, can you hand me the sugar?
Where exactly is Tom planning to build his house?
"Where's my laptop?" -- "On the table."
I don't think there's gonna be any problem.
Tom's broken up?
You need to get a haircut.
Green suits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary's playing football.
How does this work?
You're very nasty.
Come on, guys.
I'm fixing my shirt.
When is it expected to return?
I've had a good rest.
He's no less good than his sister.
Tom hits Mary.
I'm making too many mistakes.
He's not afraid of death.
It'd be good if it was 28 hours in the day, wouldn't it?
Kobe is where I was born.
He would have wanted this catastrophe to go away.
We don't expect to win.
I don't have any money.
I don't teach here anymore.
We didn't find the guy.
Take the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a di-jay.
Tom will soon learn to swim.
What's wrong with how I did it?
They know how to fish.
Tom left the room.
I'm still doing this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.
Tom's teaching French.
I tried to get in touch with her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thought he could do it.
I don't have any books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She was watching him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My job is very boring.
He's kind of a robot man.
Answer the question!
You're needed in the hospital.
I can't find the suspenders.
It's a forgery.
It's not Tom asked Mary to do it.
He has green eyes.
Yours was the best.
Tom is often mistaken.
He was tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true Tom has never been to Australia?
Now I get it.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, and it was the Grand Drive.
Tom's proud of his daughter.
Don't remind me.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was amazed Tom wanted to do it.
English is not my language.
I didn't have any friends in Australia.
Do you think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's her name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So don't do it again.
They've been here for ten years.
Tom stared at Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of the kids while she's gone.
I'm cooking now.
Did you see Tom's passport?
Do you want to dance?
He's often late.
Do you remember that summer when Tom shook his head?
Why would Tom do that?
I know this girl's dad.
This is my third marriage.
Tom can't come with us.
I've got 30 points.
If I don't do it, Tom's gonna be mad.
Aren't you a psychologist?
Don't you write it down?
The big tree fell on the road, and when I was driving, my path was blocked.
I like Tom's company.
Not all the gold shining.
I don't have many friends.
Do you believe in the existence of a god?
I live in Boston.
Tom's blind since he was born.
He didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Don't you get bored?
What kind of men do you like?
Why do people still smoke?
I'm not working for you.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
I'm a student, and he's not.
I was trying to do it.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I got my son new sleds.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my youngest sister, Sakiko, who was born the same year as I am, and now she's getting ready for the exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Have you finished your homework?
Monday will probably be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Maybe you should help Tom paint the fence.
Why do people act like big apes, and vice versa?
Can you help me?
Asshole.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go see a doctor.
I've been putting the documents on the table.
It's snowing today.
She continued to work.
The brass broke up when we went up the mountain.
Tom's driving.
If you ate less hamburgers, you'd probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Mary's not coming, is she?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go in person.
Please show me how this is done.
Aren't you dating anyone?
All the shops are busy.
I haven't made a decision yet.
What's the date today?
Where's Dad?
Lock the door.
I'm not talking to Tom French.
The apple doesn't fall far from the apple.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
The uncle is the brother of your father or mother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She has red eyes.
They're not coming back.
I was wearing jeans.
I'll see you after the show.
I'd like to ask you a question.
That's my grandmother.
It's a whale.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined the Church of Satan.
I still want to do this to you.
Tom has no money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
Do you mind?
I haven't seen you in all eternity.
You're obviously right.
Who's the books?
That's what you want to do, right?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom walks dogs twice a day.
Let me take a look at Tom's book.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Sikoku, Honsu, and Kyushu.
You must be very busy.
Tom doesn't have a lot of money in the bank.
I think we need to go now.
We didn't do it.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I'm not gonna help you.
It's a mess.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can match it in a Tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you get that?
She committed suicide.
We've put in our office with computers.
We have to pay in time.
Are you sure?
You think Tom's gonna die?
Don't you plan on staying?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it now.
Let's sing the song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You've missed a lot.
I'm dressing my boots.
You can count on me.
His book has become a subject of criticism.
It's gonna be brilliant.
I'm so scared.
You have to help her, and fast!
It's much worse.
I'm in the middle of something.
You didn't waste your time.
Who knows when Tom's gonna do it?
Tom was a witness in Mary's case.
I thought you'd left.
Tom won't catch Mary.
May I ask your name?
I wrote you ten letters.
What do we do?
Aren't you gonna vote?
You have to quit smoking.
I think Tom is disloyal.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Do you know how to play violin?
Give me the salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom is good at speaking French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's miserable.
He was a popular student as well as a student.
Tears of grief can't help.
Tom's playing football and running.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll meet Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom didn't know how to speak French?
He always sings when he showers.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung up the listener.
I'll be right back.
The Church is at the bottom of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why would you do that?
More coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do it.
Tom's on the phone for you.
You have to tell him to do it.
He speaks esperanto with a small French accent.
It's not your thing.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't do it.
She's got good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom will come to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to talk French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a lady's helper.
I'll deal with it.
Did you find any errors?
I'd like to see your mother.
You're a sorcerer?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Get off me.
You're gonna let Tom kill you?
You're a good woman.
There is hope.
When I was a kid, I was very shy.
Tom actually moved to Boston?
Tom stretched out Mary's beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow up so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He went back to the hotel.
When did you get back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
The media follow the rules of their language in a subconscious way, without even being aware of them.
Tom's on vacation.
What happens if I press this button?
The hunters aimed their rifles at the elephant.
No one's spinning.
They tried.
Tom and Mary are still here?
Thomas is a Canadian woman.
Do you have any allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do it.
I'd like to borrow the money.
I shake Tom's hand.
They're gonna be okay.
Half of these apples are rotting.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You don't have to worry about tomorrow's exam.
Did Tom vote?
I'll be back.
Tom won't make Mary do it.
Tom's starting to tread.
Instead of going to school, he stayed at home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You don't have to trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You can't run.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where'd you spend your vacations?
This year you got a Christmas gift from Tom?
I'm still a bit bored with the house, and so many things seem strange to me.
I have a memory problem sometimes.
Where's mom?
He came to his senses three hours after the accident.
Do you speak Macedonian?
You don't have to talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Is Tom okay?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know why?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom's a bit behind the chart.
Tom's not a hero.
Is it possible to catch a cab here?
Hurry up, you'll be late.
It's gonna be hard.
Is Tom always like this?
I like to play golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk so loudly.
Our team needs your help.
You never lie.
Wait-wait-wait, did you say "girl" or "boyfriend"?
It'll work, you'll see.
She left it.
Tom's safe.
I finally got my driver's license.
I'm not a student.
So it was Mary's pity.
I'm just watching the news right now.
Tom keeps checking his phone.
How's the wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom is not rich, Mary is rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
We're all late, except for me.
Stop it!
It's a book.
I don't plan on scattering a boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom has a lot of strange ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with a client.
I'm disappointed in your efficiency.
Haven't you ever had a car before?
You've been to work?
What do you learn?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Good morning.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She totally ignores me.
Tom goes to the party tonight.
I was talking.
She was on her way to the airport.
She learns Portuguese in Brazil.
What do you tell them?
How did you know this was gonna happen?
What is it?
If the natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, the esperanto can be compared to a plastic tree that was created artificially.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's gonna be in Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be so mad.
Tom has a good garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you were just doing your job.
We're gonna go on foot.
Tom said what exactly happened?
I finally realized I'm not in love with you.
Did you say that 'cause I was kidding?
So it was a terrible bore.
Tom said I was good.
I'll be at the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a bit shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you know?
Do they suspect me?
Tom was a bit confused.
I want to talk to her.
Take the trash out.
Don't you come back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a Boston map?
Your sister is as good as ever.
This will be very hard to do.
The child was paralyzed by fear.
Do you like these parfums?
How terrible!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him to work, you need to take his youth into account.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.
It's his obsessive idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom reluctantly left the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe it.
I was in a white dress.
Check again.
Tom has a Sin-Doctor.
I know it won't be possible.
Do you have something from the main pain?
Children are like friends, not parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play with friends outside.
Whatever happens, keep your peace.
Tom sent a message to Mary.
He's always happy.
When Mary got to the bus stop, the last bus was on the way.
Tom's in his black coat today.
I'll wait for 2:30.
Tom is my kid.
We used to talk French.
Bananas taste good.
They're eating.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they're worthless.
Did you try talking to them?
Doing it was much harder than it seemed.
Her friends laughed at her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to know what I was saying.
I doubt Tom can win.
Aliens come and take our work from us, land for the Earthers!
Don't worry.
Bell invented the phone in 1876.
You gonna go with the train?
Tom said Mary was good.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still sleeping, right?
So you still like Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad, and he never came back.
Put your toys together.
Doing it was much harder than it seemed.
I think I'm good at it.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I'm getting better.
Are these people crazy?
That's why I'm curious.
Have you finished your job yet?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's not hard to do.
Tom's dead.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but taller than my dad.
Tom doesn't know what you've done.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I've never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was hard.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I still wanted to sell it.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would.
You've missed something.
I called Tom right away.
You looked interested.
It'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We don't really have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to reach his goal.
Ken has two cats.
I realized what my mistake was.
I like to go.
The phone's not working.
That's what we want.
Tom's in sunglasses.
Tom's a good drawer.
All you have to do is press the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can you rent a Halloween suit?
Tom's busy, and he can't help you right now.
We're not a couple.
A student wants to see you.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm getting hot.
Why aren't you sleeping?

Can I touch your tits?
I should cancel my trip to L.A.
When the big earthquake hit me, I was just ten years old.
My sister has two sons, so I have two deities.
Open the door.
I don't mind.
Put it off the table.
Tom got out of the stool.
I was wondering if Tom ever slept on the bench.
Why is everyone crying?
I wrote a letter in French.
You're so impatient with me.
That was not the only problem.
Mary's clearing up.
Try not to sleep.
I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be in Boston right now.
I'm not going home.
We don't blame you.
Tom came to me the day.
He said he was innocent, but yet we thought he was guilty.
Tom was at the party until the end.
I'm a constant client.
Isn't your specialty a chemist?
It's not hard to find you.
Take just one.
Tom's a real scumbag.
Do you still live with your parents?
You think I still love her?
It's snowing today.
No doubt.
We didn't know what to do next.
We caught it hot.
People have been deprived of their political rights.
There's a whale on the table.
Tom was Mary's first teacher.
I'm in the hospital.
I finally made this count.
Tom colored it.
I didn't say why I wanted to do it.
How would you distinguish an American from an Englishman?
Are you having lunch?
I hate zoos.
She was a well-known actor.
"Shortly" is a "slowly" anonym.
Help us!
Let me try.
The sky is clear.
My head hurts a lot.
Tom sang for Mary.
I like the chocolate ice cream!
Tom loved Boston.
Is it hot in there?
Who's your favorite composer?
He's a famous artist.
When can you help me?
Everything went according to plan.
When did you go to bed last night?
My French teacher is my age.
If you don't go now, they'll kill you.
Treat your age.
Mouse cells are no less than human cells.
She played the guitar, and he sang.
Is this drinking water?
Did you tell them that?
Tom knew Mary hardly could do it.
Even Tom didn't have to do it.
He's doing everything he can to make a successful test.
Did you hear something?
Is that why you bought all this?
When Ken’s parents fight, he always protects his mother.
Is it Tuesday?
I have an important message.
Tom is a promiscuous child.
I have family in Boston.
You're a good man.
You'll be late for the train if you don't hurry up.
There are many species in the zoo.
Tom's bleeding.
How should I answer this question?
He adores animals.
I thought Tom was with you.
Tom sings well.
Linux is a free operating system, you should try it.
We just talked about you.
Come to me sometimes.
Are you German?
Get out of here!
I finally got the answer to my question.
Sometimes a dog is a dangerous animal.
Oh, please don't say it.
Spring is my favorite time of year.
I think it can happen.
We lost three games in a row.
Tom really told you that?
The eyeballs are in the garden somewhere.
We're trying.
Don't worry, it won't taste.
My phone number is two, four, six, eight.
Is there a park for yachts around here?
I don't have time or money for this.
We can pay.
I think I did it wrong.
I'm looking for a book for the kids.
I doubt Tom's coming.
He doesn't care what others say.
Tom got the ball.
Why is life so hard?
Some people are very stressful.
I don't know how old Tom is.
Mary was the only girl in the club.
It's a complex problem.
Mary's at work, isn't she?
I told him to speak French.
Tom's a teacher, isn't he?
Tom's amazed.
I tried to help you.
I didn't try.
No one's gonna take me to work.
Don't you want to have kids?
Iceless tea.
Philosophy is not a thing you can learn for six months.
You want to lose weight?
Tom thought no one was watching.
My dad's too busy to go out for a walk.
This place should be visited twice.
I'm just on my way out.
He sells cars.
They were my friends.
I found something very interesting.
I'm not afraid of your dog.
Did you live here?
Maybe Tom's tired.
I don't think we can do this.
Tell me 'cause I'll call you back.
We'll try.
Tom shared Mary's pain.
They're sick of playing.
I can't forget her smile.
I hope Tom didn't do what you asked him to do.
I don't like fish.
I'm not who I give up.
I feel tired.
I have food.
Mary asked Tom to let her drive.
Tom's excuse was miserable.
Warschau is cheaper than London?
I'm ashamed of my bad English.
Are you hungry?
How'd you get out of jail?
You can't prove anything.
You're a success.
I have a guinea pig.
You have blue lips.
Who did you go to dance with?
Thank you, I downloaded all six files.
Tom died of TB in 2013.
Good work!
My whale is so cute.
I like cakes.
He's got an extinct look.
Look, here comes your train.
This watch is mine.
What are you looking for?
Life is beautiful.
It wasn't easy.
Do you like chocolate milk?
Are you a ghost?
You have restored my faith in humanity.
How's your mother?
He doesn't believe in evolution.
I hurt my back.
Where did you work last year?
Your secret will be safe with me.
Tom would be very proud of you.
He's come by himself.
I'm so hungry.
Tom died in the same year as Mary.
We went to the street.
I think it's a bad way to go to school.
It's very cold.
That's why you're back from Boston, right?
Tom believed it?
In fact, he's never been to New York.
Tom thought Mary and John might be involved in arms smuggling.
I was sober back then.
Here's your turnout.
Tom was waiting for Mary.
Rio de Janeiro was founded in 1565.
I'm gonna go to Boston with Tom.
I don't think you can do that.
First, you have to understand yourself.
I was there last night.
I'll wait here until he comes.
Tom can drive.
I'm reading novels on purpose.
I was gonna tell Tom, but I forgot.
I'm a hero.
They love us.
I really need your help.
Tom has betrayed you.
I got up about six.
I don't want to brag, but I'm pretty smart.
Does it matter?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Tom may not even be on the team.
I'm asking myself if we can trust that.
What's wrong with her?
Are you drinking?
I got mad.
When did he arrive?
Where's your teddy bear?
How are you, Tom?
Maybe this year we'll finally win in Europe.
Where could Tom do that?
I think you're wrong.
I'm careful.
Do you have a passport?
I was able to forget my wallet.
Cats catch mice.
You can go.
Tom said he wouldn't mind doing it for Mary.
Where's Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I made Tom do it.
Why would Tom want to do that?
Birds can see the Earth's magnetic field with their eyes.
Do you need a car?
This is Tom's signature.
What really happened here?
Oh, my God!
Don't come in!
Are you planning on doing this somehow?
Am I making myself clear?
I'm free today.
Tom will probably be punished for doing it.
No matter what, Tom is happy.
There's no need to be hasty.
Are you happy?
I didn't believe him at first.
The phone's not working right now.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Come in.
Tom can be fined if he does.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
It's really not smart.
Tom is my big brother.
Tom told Mary he saw John in January.
You always get up early, don't you?
She's against herself all the time.
They live in the same state.
My dog follows me wherever I go.
Thank you for your help.
Tom said he didn't want to die.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Tom's already in French.
The earth has gone from father to son.
No roses without spikes.
I hope it's not them.
Don't drink too much, huh?
Tonight, expect a surprise.
You'll never be alone.
Why should we not do so?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I like watching TV.
He left the family.
Shall we?
You don't have to get in touch with Tom.
I was scorching.
I'm the boss.
Tom did a good job.
You have to go home by 9:00.
Tom and Mary danced all night.
Tom admitted he did it.
Tom can't drive.
Tom spent the day with his daughter.
Every student has his or her own part.
We were ready.
I'm worried about getting sued.
My homeland lives here.
Tom's listening.
I got away with it.
Tom's good at speaking French.
I know I'm going to learn a lot.
I went to fish on Monday.
Mary loved her dog.
Party's over.
The unicycle has one wheel.
"Daddy, look over there, shark!" "This is a whale, Tom."
I know you're hiding something.
People always say I'm very kind.
I'm a nerd.
I think Tom knows something.
It was my mistake, not Thomas.
The congregations went pretty well.
At this time of year, the wind is blowing out of the ocean.
I saw Tom grin.
Come on, let's go!
I'm sure he's an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I've never mentioned it.
Go and kill this bully.
This is our car.
Hi, I'm Basher!
Tom bought Mary a rose.
I'm ashamed I did it.
Do I have to go to the hospital?
In her spare time, she makes dolls.
I think Tom sings "cantree" better than any other person I know.
He drinks a moderate amount of coffee.
What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them today.
She doesn't care how dressed she is.
Did you see his new movie?
I'm good at it.
Why was he released?
Tom said Mary left.
I don't have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My unbiased view is that it's a terrible movie.
You're very elegant.
As you wish.
I could have changed.
It's real.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Tom doesn't trust us.
She's at Tom's.
Tom was barefoot.
I've done my best.
If you see an error, please correct it.
We tried it again, but it didn't work.
I wanted to talk to my lawyer.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do it.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
You have to help her.
You can't pay for a bad cry.
He did his homework on his own.
It was a hot day.
I need a vacation.
We want to get on that mountain.
Tom missed lunch.
You're good at speaking English.
He loved his parents.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom's not very organized, is he?
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do this?
I hope you'll be back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
Love can't be bought.
If you didn't want to come, you had to say something.
I'm ready to work.
What kind of theater is this?
Did you see the squirrel?
Mary said Tom told her.
Tom was not a very good witness.
I went to see my grandmother.
I hate a wedding.
I heard the incoming door swirling.
I don't follow you.
Mary's a great dancer.
My grandfather is from Osaka.
I want to massage, I need to relax.
Tom's so lucky.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
Did you get a nap?
I was very sincere.
I'm not sure who did it.
What do you think, when will Tom be here?
Is it snowing tonight?
Do you care?
Are you seeing someone here?
I live in Milan.
When did she do anything for me?
I ate an orange.
The square root of the two is an irrational number.
It's small.
Didn't you know this was gonna happen?
Bad thoughts give birth to bad actions.
Did you bring a hairdresser?
Tom's not wrong.
Do you have a change from this bill?
Tom seems a bit embarrassed.
We can't go without water.
I can't get my head together.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in a village.
I would never give up.
I speak fluent French.
Tom didn't waste time on it.
Insinuate me.
You're disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He was very drunk.
Tom says he's happy.
How are you feeling now?
How many guys do you have in your class?
It's a big apple.
Pick a good gift.
I'm going with her.
Why would you do something like that?
The richest man in the world could not have bought his love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new tires.
Lack of news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers are saving us time.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
You're obviously sick.
You've been to London three times.
I'll be back.
Tom didn't see you.
I'm walking slow.
After the movie, they fell asleep.
I started coughing.
We're getting married in June.
I was wondering if Tom left Boston.
I threw my bones.
The book was short of a number of pages.
I picked up the coin.
I have to go to a meeting.
Tom never breaks a promise.
We have to protect ourselves.
You know Jamal and Sarah don't get along very well.
Every student has his or her own part.
I spent 12 hours.
I'm gonna make it worse.
I'm not sure Tom's telling the truth.
It's none of your business.
Don't go.
Tom has no thirst.
I learned to eat a cow.
I'm all right.
I'm sorry I'm not rich.
She was very saddened by the news.
I have a lot of time.
Happy New Year!
You'll see for yourself.
I've never killed anyone.
What's your name?
She's holding the flowers in her hand.
Have you talked to him yet?
We're used to it.
Old man in his mid-nineties.
This coffee is so hot I can't drink it.
Where'd you get this?
Are we done?
You're from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You're good at doing this, aren't you?
These apples taste good.
Can I borrow your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom's special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She has red blood.
What's wrong?
I owe you ten dollars.
Listening to music is my favorite way to rest.
We were ready to attack.
When is the celebration?
Did you help?
Are you a cop?
Tom didn't do anything we told him to do.
You didn't see it.
I know Tom lied to us.
Tom heard Mary got married.
I've learned a lot.
How much does this paraplu cost?
They both laughed.
What's wrong?
It's possible.
Tom thinks Mary's exhausted.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
Everyone in Tom's class got flu.
Remember when you first heard the Beatles?
Did Tom get hurt?
I want you to come to my party.
No toilet paper.
The word is silver, the silence is gold.
Please sit here and wait.
I love this T-shirt.
Drink the water out of the stream.
I'm usually more busy than Tom.
I moved in last month.
Tom's probably still mad.
I'll go to the airport.
Don't mind her whims.
I'm glad Tom will help us.
Tom will be here any minute.
Glad they're both on our team.
Where can we sit?
Do you like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How long does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see each other again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I invited her to a date.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks scared.
When did you get to China?
Do you approve of what Tom's doing?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
It's an ideal opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary she had to do it.
I don't expect them to win.
I fell asleep.
How is this my fault?
With regard to Switzerland, have you been there in the winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It's getting better.
I'm learning Vietnamese.
I'm gonna meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay off the loan.
Try to look at it from Tom's point of view.
The window has been opened.
No one thinks so.
I took off my shoes.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You'll be happy.
Tom looked pretty sick when I last saw him.
Tom's still dating Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
You think you're funny?
I usually work from nine to five.
Let me do it with you.
Mary was watching a romantic comedy.
Grab him!
Someone knocked on Tom's door.
Tom's such an asshole.
Would you like some more potatoes?
Tom was sitting.
Tom has a moustache.
I have three questions for you.
I met Tom a few times.
Do you use a text CPU?
Tom and Mary do a lot of things together.
Please move.
What are you doing this evening?
Why'd you color the shop red?
No, it's not my house.
You speak fluent French, right?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
You don't know how to speak French, do you?
You're not.
Let's go home.
I said hi to Tom.
Tom took off his ring.
I'll make you breakfast.
Tom was listening.
Who broke this window?
Your ideas are a bit out of date.
