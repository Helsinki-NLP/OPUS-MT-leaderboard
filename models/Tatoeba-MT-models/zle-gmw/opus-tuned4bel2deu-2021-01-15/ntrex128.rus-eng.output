Members of the Welsh Assembly don't want to look like muppets.
Some of the members of the National Assembly are dissatisfied with the proposal to accept the MWP abbreviation for their name (Member of the Welsh Parliament is a member of the Welsh Parliament).
The problem is the plan to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One of the Laborists, expressing his party's views, expressed his concern that the new abbreviation was “ripping Twp and Pwp.
For our readers, not from Wales: on the Wallian twp means "bitch," and pwp means "cuckoo."
According to a member of the Welsh Party, his organization was generally “disgruntled” and offered other options.
The members of the Conservative Party “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in the Welsh language is spoken about as the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting a change of name bill, made the following statement: “The final decision on the name of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be left to them.
The Welsh Administration Act of 2017, the National Assembly of Wales has the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published a public opinion poll on the options proposed, according to which the version of the Welsh Parliament, instead of the Assembly, found wide support among the local population.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP) option, while the MWP option received the greatest public support.
Members seem to be offering other options, but the Presiding Member, Elin Jones, will find it hard to find a solution that would please everyone, and recall that the draft law on changes should be tabled in a few weeks.
Reform laws will include other changes to the Assembly ' s work process, including new rules on disqualifying members of the Assembly and setting up the Committee ' s system.
Members of the Assembly will vote in favour of the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, the Macedonians will vote to rename the country as the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
A popular vote is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with a neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek government has long insisted that the name of the Republic of Macedonia presupposes a territorial claim against the Greek province, and has repeatedly objected to the entry of its northern neighbour into the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, stated that he was not going to accept the results.
But the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, note that a change in the name of the country is just the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
The crisis in Harlem parishes: St. Martin's bells are forever silent
“The city of the area I was talking to said that there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams says.
“And now there is none left.”
The disappearance of bars can still be understood:
"The format of communication has changed."
“The bar has no longer been a kind of living room for the entire area, which has been visited on a regular basis.
But as far as the churches are concerned, the money from the sale of assets will be short enough, no matter how much their leaders hope.
At the place of the church, he added, there would be a multi-family home whose tenants were not likely to support the parish.
“Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white, ” Adams says. “This will bring the day when such churches will be shut down, because new neighbors will never become their parishioners. ”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black district: the Metropolitan Comunity in 1870, and the St. Martin Church 10 years later.
The first members of the Methodist Church left the parish in the 1930s.
Their building was bought by a black parish next door.
When the Church of St. Martin went to the hands of the black community, it was led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of shops on 125th Street, Harlem's main trade artery, where they refused to hire or promote blacks.
In 1939, the building was heavily damaged by the fire, and in the course of the reconstruction work, Father Johnson was ordered to install a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, who replaced him at the head of St. Martin's Church, proudly called the Carillon “a colloquium for the poor.
But the expert who tried the carillon in July called it a different one: a “cultural heritage” and a “unique historical instrument”.
An expert from the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng, also noted that it was the Carillon from St. Martin's Church that was the world's first instrument of some kind played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lindh. He was invited to play at a larger carillon in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's Church still has no substitute.
Over the past few months, the Church of St. Martin has been in a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by the secular leaders of the Church, and others by the Diocese of the Episcopal Church.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, which includes secular leaders, approached the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese “will try to transfer the cost of the work” to the parochial assembly, although the latter had no bearing on the choice of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners expressed dissatisfaction with the diocese ' s lack of transparency.
In California, a shark shot a 13-year-old lobster diver.
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a 13-year-old diver in California was attacked by a shark and injured.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach Beach beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hummel told in an interview with KSWB-TV Station (San Diego), he dived with his friends on Saturday morning, and about half an hour later he heard a boy cry for help, and he and his friends swam on a boat to the scene of the attack and pulled the boy out of the water.
According to Hummel, at first he decided that the boy was very happy to catch a lobster, but fast, "because he was yelling, 'I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
Hummel, a diver, observed that "his skin was completely lacerated around the clavicle."
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water, "Here's a shark!" Hummel says.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Radi Children ' s Hospital in San Diego; his condition is assessed as critical.
The type of shark attacking a teenager is unknown.
Squad Captain Larry Giles, in a press briefing, reported that a shark had been spotted in this place a few weeks ago, but it was not classified as a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack was injured in the upper part of the body.
The authorities closed the area from Ponto Beach in Casablade to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Giles observed that there are 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Seinbury is planning to conquer the British perfume-cosmetic market.
Seinsbury is going to install a cosmetics and perfume section in Booths, Superdrag and Debenhams shops with cosmetics consultants, using a model of luxurious shops.
The British perfume and cosmetic market is estimated at £2.8 billion, and it continues to expand, while in fashion and household goods, the market is falling, and in order to capture a large share of this desirable market as an experiment in 11 shops all over the country, there will be spacious sections of cosmetics and perfume, and if it is successful next year, it will be expected in many other shops.
Supermarket owners are looking for something to fill the shelves that used to be used for TVs, microwave kilns, household goods, and investments in the perfume-cosmetic market seem to be a good solution.
According to the representatives of Seinsbury, it is planned to double the range of cosmetic products to 3,000 items, including for the first time stamps such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, by the type of organization in Booth's shops.
In addition, the brand line of the “Butic Cosmetics” product will be reorganized to include vegan products in order to meet the demands of young buyers.
In two of Seinsbury's shops, there will be kiosks of fragrance shop, the first of which has already been opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second is expected to be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Internet commerce and the tendency to buy a small amount of food for every day in small shops close to home have led supermarkets to attract customers in other ways.
Mike Coop, president of Seinsbury, says that the outlets will gradually turn into a department store, and his supermarket network is fighting for buyers to compete against low-priced shops, such as Aldy and Leedle, offering more services and non-food items.
Hundreds of Seinsbury supermarkets host Argos' outlets, and some of them are now able to find Habitat's shops since the network acquired both stamps two years ago, which has led to an increase in the sales of food and the proceeds from these acquisitions.
Previous supermarket attempts to give new life to their cosmetic and apothecary departments have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture between Seinsbury and Booths was set up, but there were further disagreements among participants on the sharing of the proceeds from the sale of pharmacy in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the Seinsbury Pharmaceutical Business (a total of 281 shops) to Celecio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy Network, for £125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the implementation of the plan by adding a wide line of la Roche-Posay and Vichy skin care in four shops.
Says Paul Mills-Hix, the business director of Seinsbury: "We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a better environment for our customers.
We have also invited specially trained counsellors who will always be available to help the council.
Our range of stamps for any taste, pleasant design, and comfortable shops will attract a lot of visitors to search for cosmetics and perfume, which will be a brand-new concept of shopping.
Peter Jones has "abhorrently" reacted to Holly Willoughby's exit from the £11 million deal.
The star of the show, "The Dragon's Log", Peter Jones, is "frequently" with Holly Willoughby's release from a £11 million deal she intended to make with Peter's Lifestyle Brand, but instead preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their combined brand of housewear and Truly accessories.
The business of this couple was compared to the stamp of Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of this morning's program announced her decision in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's decision to leave their lucrative Lifestyle Brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV has angered Peter Jones, the star of the dragon's Logo.
According to our sources, Jones was “infuriated” when the favorite of the viewers at a busy meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business Empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that after new contracts of up to 1.5 million, she would not have enough time for their common brand of housewear and Truly accessories.
Their mark was compared to the child of actress Gwyneth Paltrow with a Goop mark, and it was expected that her sale would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
A 37-year-old host announced her departure from Instagram, while Jones himself left Britain on a private plane in the direction of one of her villas.
According to one source, "the Truly Mark was Holly's top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her a careless existence for the next few decades.
Her decision has set off all the parties to the deal.
Everyone was stunned by what happened on Tuesday, as the stamps lasted a few weeks before the launch.
At Marlowe headquarters, there was a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the host of this morning, one of Britain’s most popular stars, can cost a firm £1 million due to significant investment in goods, from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as a potential delay in the start-up of the line.
In addition, it is a long-standing break-up of friendships.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby created a brand of Truly with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, led the company in March.
Both couples often spend their vacations together, and Jones also owns 40% of the stock of Dan Baldwin's company.
Willoughby will be the M&S ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as the host of the ITV show, "I am a celebrity."
A source from Jones' close environment said last night, "We can't comment on his business."
Complex negotiations, "and then we fell in love with each other"
He joked about the criticism that the media would have against him because of the “unworthy president” of the North Korean leader’s comment and positive appreciation.
Why did President Trump give up so many claims?
Says Trump, imitating the voice of the news host.
“I have not given up on anything.”
He noted that Kim Jong-un was interested in a re-entering after Trump called them the first summit in Singapore in June a significant step towards a reduction in North Korea ' s nuclear weapons stockpiles.
But the denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean high-level diplomat Lee Young Ho addressed world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly meeting on Saturday, saying that North Korea was still waiting for a “suitable response” from the US after the DPRK’s initial disarmament measures.
Instead, the US, the diplomat, continues to use sanctions as a leverage.
In a meeting of his supporters, President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment.
"It's a wonderful thing to do with North Korea," he said.
"We were on the verge of a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
And now we have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong-un have borne fruit: the missile tests have been put to an end, the hostages have been released, and the United States troops who remained on the territory of the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea have also returned to their country.
Referring to his relationship with Kim Jong-un, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was not strange.
“It's easy to tell the President what it is, but then, instead of 10,000 people on the street, who are going to go to this full-blown hall, there would be just 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
The tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia: catastrophic destruction has been recorded, hundreds of casualties have been recorded
In the first days of the earthquake on Lombok, a foreign NGO said that there was no need for their help.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lomboca population has lost a roof over their head, the Government has not considered it necessary to declare a national disaster, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that there is no need for international support, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children is preparing a team to go to Palau, but we don't know if a foreign group can work on the ground yet.
According to Mr. Sutopo, an official representative of the National Disaster Management Authority, the Indonesian leadership is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palau in order to determine whether international organizations should be involved.
In view of the persistent seismic instability in Indonesia, the country is still horrendously ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other shorelines.
Despite the warning of the tsunami, a siren was not included in Palau to warn the population, which is likely to have led to so many casualties.
Transport between the many Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A floating hospital, previously moored in Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake, is heading to Palau, but the road to a new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidodo has made the strengthening of Indonesia ' s old infrastructure the main focus of his campaign and has spent immense sums on the improvement of roads and railroads.
However, the administration of President Joko, who is running for a new term next year, has become overwhelmed by funding problems.
The President has also been criticized for exacerbating sectarian rivalry between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
Over a thousand people have been killed, and tens of thousands have been deprived of their homes as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, bows with arrows and other self-shooting.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Starridge compares the score in a game against Chelsea naked to the far top corner of the gate
Daniel Starridge saved the Liverpool from losing the 89th minute of the Premier League match against "Chelsey", held on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge got a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27 meters from the Chelsey Gate when his team was playing with a score of 1-0.
It moved to the left and swept into the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and found itself in the long top of the net.
Golquiper Kepa Arrisabalaga jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was too late.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com, Starridge said, "It was all about getting in this position and getting a ball, players like Shak, always playing to the maximum, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible."
"I saw Kante coming to me, I got the ball, and I hit the gate for a while."
After the first half of the match, the Chelsey team played with a score of 1-0, scored by a Belgian man, Eden Azar, for 25 minutes.
The central Chelsey attacker, passing back to Mateo Kovacic, broke through the middle of the field to half the Liverpool.
In the middle of the field, Kovacic played one touch.
He next passed the pass to Azar, who went out on the gate.
Azar overcame the defense, and from the left flank hit the gatekeeper of the Liverpool, and hit the far corner of the net.
Liverpool will meet the Napoli team at the group stage of the League of Champions, and the match will take place at the San Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
"Chelsey" will play with the Videoton Club at the UEFA Euro League game, to be held on Thursday in London, also at 3 p.m.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami rose to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and the tsunami that followed in Indonesia was 832, and the National Disaster Management Authority reported on Sunday morning.
Under the ruins of buildings destroyed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7,5 on the Richter scale, a number of people are reported to be left behind: the earthquake occurred on Friday and caused a tsunami of up to 6 meters high, reported Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official of the Office during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000 people, was swamped by the rubble of the houses that fell.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabging a woman in death.
This morning, a woman's body was found in Birkenhead County.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 at the Grayson Mews Complex on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are looking for possible witnesses to the murder among the locals.
Says DCI O'Hagen: "The investigation is at an initial stage, but I strongly ask everyone who was in the John Street area in Birkenhead and could watch or hear anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also address everyone, especially the cab drivers, who might have taped something on a video recorder, and ask us for any information that might help the investigation.
An official of the police confirmed that the victim lived in Birkenhead and her body was found in the compound.
This afternoon, the alleged victims came to the scene to ask their questions about where it was found this morning.
An investigation is under way, and the police are preparing to report the tragedy to the next of kin of the victim.
A cabbie in the Grayson Mews Complex tried to enter his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he learned what had happened, he lost his vocabulary.
The people at home were told that they would not be able to get home for at least a few hours.
One of the police officers told the tenant that the entire surrounding area was considered to have been the scene of the crime.
One woman wept.
"What a terrible thing!" she said.
At 2 p.m., two police buses arrived at the scene and another was left outside the fence.
A number of policemen have been set up inside the fence to watch the apartment complex.
Anyone who has any information is requested to send a personal message to a @MerPolCC subscriber on Twitter, call number 101, or contact Krimestoppers anonymously by phone 0800 555 111 (case 247 of 30 September).
Kromwell Monument in front of the House of Parliament led to a heated debate on the “census of history”
Cromwell’s “removal” would have been a well-deserved retribution for the barbaric destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts of England by his followers, puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Remembrance Society called Mr. Creek's proposal “a madness” and“ an attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Memory Society, stated: "As part of the ongoing debate on the demolition of historic monuments, the question of the Oliver Cromwell statue in front of the Westminster Palace has unavoidably arisen.
Cromwell has nothing to do with the iconic movement during the English civil wars.
Oliver Cromwell is probably suffering for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived forever before.
Sir William Hamo Tornicroft's brilliant picture of Cromwell's authorship reflects the view of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historic achievements of a man who many still regard as worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith stated: "Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell to be a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case to be a monarchy.
Whether such a view can be viewed as historicalally accurate is still the subject of a professional debate.
But we can say with certainty that the conflict that erupted in the middle of the 17th century has affected the country ' s subsequent development, and Cromwell was a significant historical person representing one side of this section.
Its accomplishments as Lord Protector are also to be commended and respected.
A Chinese farmer was bitten to death by a killer pig.
In a market in southwest China, a farmer has been the victim of a pig, reporting to local media.
The victim's blood (in the media only his name, "Yuan") was found with a broken artery near a slob in Lupanshui County, Guizhou, Southern China, reported by the Morning Post on Sunday.
Pig is preparing to inoculate pigs on a pig farm, May 30, 2005, Sinin County, Qinghai Province of China.
Yuan and his cousin arrived from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, his cousin found Yuan's dead body, and the door to the next pork shop was open.
There was a huge cartilage in the pig shop with blood on it.
In the course of the forensic examination, it was found that a 250-kg pig ate the farmer to death.
"My brother's legs have been bloodthirsty and crippled," said Guiyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the victim.
The surveillance video showed that Yuan arrived at the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the newspaper Evening News that the pig was insulated in a separate box during the investigation in order to avoid a re-invasion.
The Yuan family is reported to be negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the farmer ' s death.
Swine attacks on people are not common.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously traumatizing a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram animal nailed a valiant farmer to a tractor and let go, just fearful of a young wife.
In 2012, a farmer from Oregon in the United States was eaten by his own pigs, and as a Canadian farmer told CBC News, pigs are usually not aggressive, but blood taste can affect their covert aggression as a trigger.
"Pigs of the game,
They're biting and very curious, but they don't want to offend you.
You just need to instil in your animals a sense of measure and respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rose will bring the rains to a large part of the southwest of the United States
Forecasts suggest that Hurricane Rosa loses power by moving through a zone with cooler water to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring rains and floods to North Mexico and the Southwest of the United States in the next few days.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. in New York, the Cyclone reached the 1st category with winds up to 135 km/h, 360 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The storm is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, heading east to the west coast of the United States.
More than 25 cm of rain is expected in Mexico on Monday.
In the coming days, heavy rains are expected in the South-West as a result of the tropical humidity in the emerging low-pressure zone.
Rainfalls from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous flooding, dirt streams, and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the south of the States of Nevada and of Arizona, the high rate of rainfall can be 5 to 8 cm per hour due to high tropical air humidity.
In some parts of the south-west United States, most of the land in Arizona, it is expected to fall to 5 to 10 cm.
The risk of sudden, fast-growing floods due to the uneven distribution of tropical rains is not ruled out.
With the current risk of tropical rain, walking in the desert has serious consequences.
Livneys can turn canyons into turbulent rivers, and thunder can cause the winds to break out and stir up the clouds of dust.
With low-pressure areas on the shores of Southern California, the rains will fall.
It's possible to fall up to 1.5 cm of rain, which can cause small dirt streams and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
This is the first rainfall since the start of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and in the mornings, there will be tropical rains in Arizona that will spread to other territories by Monday night and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the rains will be in the four corners and will last until the evening of Wednesday.
In October, there will be extreme temperature changes throughout the United States, due to low Arctic air temperatures at high temperatures in the tropics.
At times, such a combination can result in severe temperature changes in a small area.
Such sharp temperatures will be particularly visible in the US Central on Sunday.
Between the temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and DeMoins, Iowa, there is a difference of about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will accumulate and spread to other areas.
In most of the US central and eastern territories, warm weather is expected in early October, and the temperature will be as high as 27 degrees from the South Plains to the North East.
In New York on Tuesday, the air temperature can rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast is very likely to have an extraordinarily high temperature on the east coast of the United States by mid-October.
Justice Brett Cavanaugh's Senate hearing saw over 20 million spectators
The testimony of Brett Cavanaugh and Christina Blazee Ford, who accused Cavanaugh of an attempted rape in the 1980s, on Thursday attracted over 20 million viewers to six TV stations.
The political standoff over Cavanaugh's confirmation of the candidacy received an unexpected follow-up, and on Friday, an urgent media report was made by Republican Jeff Flake to make it a condition that the charges against a lawyer be investigated by the FBI within a week.
According to Ford at the Senate's Juridical Committee, she was “100%” convinced that Cavanaugh was in a state of intoxication and tried to undress her at a school party.
Cavanaugh gave an emotional statement, saying he was 100% sure it didn't.
According to Nielsen, there were over 20.4 million spectators watching the debate on Friday.
The Agency used the average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data on the number of audiences of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen's ratings do not always take into account the viewers watching TV at work.
By way of comparison, this is an average audience following the American football game in playoffs or the Oskar ceremony.
The largest audience was Fox News Channel, whose hosts very much supported Cavanaugh's appointment: the senate hearing, which lasted all day, saw an average of 5.69 million viewers, reported by Nielsen.
The second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audition was 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, and MSNBC watched 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million viewers, says Nielsen.
After the hearing, the interest in the case has not diminished.
There was a real drama with Jeff Flake on Friday.
After a senator from Arizona, considered a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support Cavanaugh's candidacy, CNN and CBS were able to capture the camera, as on Friday morning, on his way to a meeting of the Legal Committee, Flake ran into a group of activists who criticized the senator.
The whole world has seen him get a resentment from angry women live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," one of them said.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
“For you, the power, while so many women are powerless,” the woman tried to explain her position.
Blake replied to the activists that his office had already prepared a statement, and he would address the issue at the committee meeting, and the elevator doors closed, concealing the senator from all-embracing cameras.
When, after a few hours, the Legal Committee was preparing to approve Cavanaugh's candidacy for the post of judge and send her to the Senate for a general vote, all TV channels aired the meeting live.
But Flake put one condition in place: an FBI investigation on the charges against a candidate by next week, as a democratic minority wanted.
Blake claims to have changed his mind thanks to the intervention of a friend, a senator from the Democrats, Chris Coons.
He made the final decision, talking to Kuns and a few other senators.
Flake’s decision had an effect, as it was clear that the Republicans lacked the votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
By order of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is blaming his critics for "political games" about the Brexit situation.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May blamed the politicians who were criticizing her plan to leave the EU for putting narrow-party interests ahead of the public interest.
The British Prime Minister attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published on one page with May, former MID head Boris Johnson criticized her so-called Brexit "Shot" plan, saying that he considered the import of customs between Britain and the EU to be "absolutely absurd."
Death of Wade Simms in an exchange of fire: The police arrested Davon Simpson on suspicion of the murder of a forwarder at the University of Louisiana
The police arrested a man suspected of having been killed by a shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player playing for the University of Louisiana.
According to the Baton-Ruge Police, Doyon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and detained for second-degree murder.
The police released a video of a fight with Simms and Simpson, where Simms lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, a regional CBS channel, the police found Simpson's DNA on the sunglasses found at the crime scene.
During the interview, Simpson admitted that he had fatally shot Wade.
According to Advocate, Simpson has a 350,000-dollar bond.
The Coroner of the Eastern Baton-Ruja County released a pre-trial detention on Friday: the death was caused by a cross-cut shot in the neck and head.
The Division thanks the Criminal Investigation Department of the State Police of Louisiana, the State Police Forensics Lab, the University of the South Police and the locals, who assisted in the investigative activities leading to the detention.
Joe Alleveva, Director of Sport, University of Louisiana, thanked the law enforcement forces for their “good-faith work in catching a criminal.
Simms was only 20 years old.
The two-metre forward was a native of Baton-Ruge, and his father, Wayne, was also a member of the Louisiana State University team.
In the last season, Simms scored 5.6 points and averaged 2.6 rebounds per match.
Team coach Will Wade made a statement on Friday morning, saying that the tragic death of Wade Simms caused a "shock" and a "true woe" for all the players.
"That's what I've always been afraid of," he added.
The vulcan covered the ashes of Mexico City
The vulcan Popocatepetl fell in ashes to the south of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Natural Disaster Prevention of Mexico recommended that the population should not approach the volcano: its crater was active and had 183 ferroga-emissions in 24 hours.
The Centre observed that there was a lot of rumbling and trembling in the vicinity of the volcano.
In some parts of Mexico City, such as Sochimilko, social media users have published photographs of frontal windows of cars covered with thin ashes.
After an earthquake of 7.1 Mw, which hit the central part of Mexico in September 2017, geophysics recorded an increase in volcanic activity 72 km south-east of the capital.
The Volcano Popocatepetl (or, for his own, Don Goyo) has been an active volcano since 1994.
Police encounters with Katalan separatists in the run-up to the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, a multi-thousand meeting was held in Barcelona to mark the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which split the country into two camps; there was a clash between the supporters of independence and the police; and six participants in the riots were detained.
Police officers dissuaded protesters of independence, while the last, with black masks, threw eggs and powdered paint at the guards, raising the clouds of dark dust in the very center of Barcelona.
After the police put in a truncheon to contain the mob, the riots resumed with new force.
For a few hours, the supporters of independence scold, "Let's not forget it, let's not forget it!" and their opponents said, "Long live Spain!"
According to the local press, fourteen of the protesters were lightly injured in the hospital.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which was declared illegal by the Spanish Government, but was a milestone for separatists, and a year later, tension in a region that is seeking to become a sovereign region remains.
Katalonia voted with a huge margin to leave Spain, but the turnout was low because the opponents of the exit largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, during the past year, almost 1,000 people were injured in an attempt by the police to block the holding of a referendum at the country ' s polling stations in violent clashes.
On Friday, the separatists spent the night on the stated path of a demonstration in support of the Spanish police in order to prevent it from taking place.
The demonstration still took place, but it went on another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended a secessionist rally in his wife's company, lamented that the hope of Cataloni's acquisition of sovereignty was becoming ever more frustrating.
“Before last year, one of the most important events in our lives has taken place.
My parents weeped with joy to be able to vote in a referendum, and today we are in a state of hanging,” he says.
In the recent December local government elections, the Katalonist parties that are in favor of secession from Spain won an important victory, albeit with a small severance, but this year their movement loses its supporters, as many of the prominent leaders of the movement are either on the run or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puch, a 42-year-old engineer who records a police rally on the phone, said that the conflict was heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
He added, "The stress is on the rise."
On Saturday, Oriol Jonkeras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalon separatists who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to denounce the loss of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish Government,” he says.
Londonderry: The car hit the house, all three of the co-defendants are under arrest.
One of the homes in London berry was tainted by a car on several occasions; the men in it, aged 33, 34 and 39, were taken into custody.
The attack took place on Thursday, about 7:30 local time, in the Ballingard Cressent area.
As a result, the firewall was damaged by the gate and the building itself, according to DCI Bob Blemmings.
There's been reports of an onion shot in the car.
Livingstone wins the Rangers thanks to Mengi's bright goal
The first goal of Dolly Mengi was a guaranteed victory for the Livingstone team.
"Livingston" won an unexpected victory over the Rangers. For the head coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerrard, this is just the second one in 18 games.
The exact hit by Dolly Menghi equals Gary Holt's team to the Hibernian Club in the chart, where they share the second place.
The Gerrard Club was left without a win-win for this season of the Premier League; on Sunday, they will meet with the leaders of the group, Harts, from which the Rangers are eight points behind.
On Thursday, the Rangers will be playing a match between the European League and the Austrian Rapid Club in Vienna.
The Livingstone Club has continued its win-win series in the Division, having played six games and not been defeated since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the team's main coach.
Lost moments for Livingstone in a fight with pushy guests
Trainer Holt's caretakers had to keep the account from the start, and the Rangers clearly failed to cope with their insistence.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of defense, but the goal of his weak attempt failed, and then Alan Litgow's defender, swinging too far, couldn't stop the ball from getting in the net.
The host allowed the Rangers to play in front of their line of protection, relying on the dangerous moments of the game's re-emergence.
That's how they missed this big goal.
The Rangers gave way to a free shot, and Livingstone took the opportunity to send Declan Gallagher and Robinson to Menge, who was beaten out of central position.
By that time, Rangers had the upper hand in the ball, but the protection of the host team was invincible, so Liam Kelly's goalkeeper was not concerned.
The second half continued in the same way, although Kelly still had to take the hit from Alfredo Morelos.
Allan McGregor punched the ball off Scott Pittman, and Litgoe made a big roll out of the standard position.
Balls have been constantly hit by the Livingston fine, but all the attacks have been repulsed, and the two demands of the penalty, one for provoking Glenn Middleton's spare player and the other hand after the game, have not been met.
"Livingston" - analysis
From BBC Scotland - Alasder Lamont, a report from the Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Fenomeenal game and excellent result for the Livingstone team.
All the players were brilliant, and once again outperformed all the expectations, continuing to climb to the football Olympics.
Their style of play and composition has not changed much since they got up to the top of the rating line, and Coach Holt's credit is that he's been mobilizing this team from the start.
There were a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Hulkett led a brilliantly organized defense, and Menga wouldn't let Connor Goldson and Joe Warrall relax.
At the same time, the Rangers were not able to get to the rhythm.
Although they had a good game moment with Coach Gerrard, this time they didn't live up to our expectations.
In the last minutes of the match, they didn't have enough to own the ball, and they've only been able to get the support of the host team once. The Rangers, down to the middle of the table, have a lot to think about.
Refrigeration of Erdogan during a visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for lunch, there was a beautiful weather, and the two tops were in a great mood.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to establish a relationship between the two NATO member countries, a visit already involving some conflicts.
The heads of country have not been able to find an understanding on such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey ' s EU membership.
After Erdogan went to Cologne to attend the opening ceremony of a vast new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish diaspora outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a 25-000-dollar mob from entering the mosque, but many of Erdogan ' s supporters settled in the vicinity to see their president.
In the same place, opponents of the Erdogan regime, including the Kurds, gathered to condemn both Erdogan’s policy and the German Government’s decision to invite him to Germany.
The fact that there are radically opposing points of view at the meeting reflects the ambiguities of this figure: many Germans with Turkish origins extoll Erdogan, while others view him as a tyrant.
Deptford Road Traffic Crash: A car crash led to the death of a cyclist
In London, the car ran into a cyclist who died at the scene.
The accident occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelin Street, a lively junction in the south-eastern part of Depfort, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car and the paramedics who arrived at the site tried to help the cyclist, but the man passed away without coming to his senses.
This is not the only fatal incident in the area: just a mile from the scene, on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a car whose driver ran off.
The London Police report that work is under way to identify the deceased and to inform the next of kin.
In the meantime, the road is closed down at the scene and the bus route has been rerouted, and motorists are asked not to go to the area.
Insurgency in Long-Lartin prison: 6 policemen injured
According to the Long-Lartin administration, during the riots in the men ' s high security prison, six police officers were injured.
In the Long-Lartin, Wustershire, men's high security prison, there have been riots since Sunday, about 9:30 a.m. local time.
The Tornado Task Force was called to deal with the riots involving eight one-wing prisoners.
The police had been slightly injured in the soft tissue of the person; they had been provided with on-site medical care.
According to the official representative of the prison, “specially trained staff have been recruited to deal with the incident at the Long-Lartin Correctional Institution.
Six of them have been injured.
We categorically condemn the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police, and their preventive measure can be changed for a longer period.”
Long-Lartin currently has over 500 inmates, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, there was a report in the media that the prison manager had been taken to a hospital under attack by a prisoner.
And last October, the prison authorities had to bring in special units to calm the raging prisoners who threw biljart balls at the wardens.
Hurricane Rose can sink Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Arizona rarely enters the area of the intensive tropical cyclone, but this time it has been “suffered”: early next week, Hurricane Rosa, after taking the last leap, has to pass over the desert of South West and bring with it the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona and the south and east of the state of Nevada, in south-eastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurrikan Rosa is expected to take a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday and rain on Monday night.
The Phoenix Office of the National Meteorological Service reported on Twitter that “a total of 10 tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within a 320 km radius from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the border of Arizona.
The National Meteorological Service has recently predicted that it will fall from 5 to 10 centimetres of rainfall, up to 15 centimetres on the Arizona Mogolon-Rim Plateau.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Pool, which may fall up to 2.5 to 5 cm of rain, rainfall can be as high as 10 cm.
For areas that are overwhelmed by the rains, the rains brought by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing, for the region has long suffered from drought.
While flooding may be a danger, the heavy rains can ease the dry season, not in the South-West of the United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, there is at least a severe drought on more than 40% of the Territory of Arizona (the second-largest category),” reports the Web site Weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Mexican state of Lower California.
As of Sunday morning, a hurricane with a maximum speed of 137 km/h is 360 km south of the city of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The storm was found in a zone with cooler water on the Pacific coast and thus is losing its power.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of “tropical storm”.
In some parts of Mexico, it is expected that massive flooding will take place.
"From low California to the Northwest, the Sunora can fall up to 7 to 10 cm of rain, up to 25 cm in space," reports the Web site Weather.com.
Next, Hurricane Rosa will go north through Mexico, and on Tuesday morning it will go to the border with Arizona in the tropic Cyclone category, from Arizona to the south of Utah by Tuesday night.
“The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rose and its remains is the heavy rains in lower California, in the north-west of Sonora, and in the deserts of the south-west United States,” reports the National Meteorological Service.
Rain is expected to cause dangerous flooding, dirt streams in the desert and possible landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Northon: four suspects in attempted murder are in custody
In Somerset, a 16-year-old boy was seriously stabbed, and three young men and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The victim was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 4 a.m. on Saturday morning.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as “stabil”.
On the same night, four suspects, aged 17, 18 and 20, were arrested in the Radstock area, reporting to the Avon and Somerset County Police.
The police are looking for possible witnesses of a crime with any video of the incident on their mobile phone.
Donald Trump: "On Cavanaugh 'all the hatred, all the anger' of the Democrats has fallen."
“The voice for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by the Democrats,” Trump said at a meeting of his collaborators in Wiling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, during the process of approving Cavanaugh's nomination for a candidate, “all the hatred, all the anger” of the Democratic Party has been broken.
On Thursday, Cavanaugh testified at the U.S. Congress, in his emotional treatment categorically rejecting the charge of Christina Blazee Ford that he had sexually harassed her more than 30 years ago when both of them were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during her trial.
On Saturday, the U.S. President said that that day, "the American people saw Cavanaugh's brilliant mind, class, and courage."
“The voice for Judge Cavanaugh's claim is a voice for one of the most prominent jurists of our time, with an unblemished state record,” the President of the U.S. state of West Virginia announced to a group of his associates.
In his speech, the President indirectly addressed the issue of Cavanaugh's nomination, referring to the importance of the Republican turnout for the Congress and House of Representatives.
“The most important elections in our lives are only five weeks.
I'm not part of it, but I'm part of the race in a different way," he said.
“I'm burning up and I'm fighting for our excellent candidates.”
Trump is of the view that the Democrats have set themselves the task of “resisting against us with all their means”.
According to the regulations, the first key vote in the Senate on the confirmation of Cavanaugh ' s candidacy should take place no later than Friday, was announced by the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party.
The earthquake in Indonesia has cost hundreds of lives, and the total number of casualties continues to grow.
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had been killed, and many had been taken away by the massive waves that had seized the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which was hit by an incredibly strong tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims were hundreds of visitors to the beach festival in the city of Palu, and on Friday, at the end of the coast, a wave of about six meters [6 m] in height, which swept all the way and led to the sudden death of many of the people present.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7,5 on the Richter scale.
“When a storm warning was issued yesterday, people continued their beach vacation, instead of running off to shelter immediately, and as a result lost their lives,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official of the Indonesian National Disaster Management Authority at a press conference held in Jakarta.
“The tsuns didn't come one way, the water stream was full of cars, logs, houses, and the element was ruining everything on its way,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at a rate of 497 km/h and hit the coast with all its might.
Some of them climbed up the trees, saving their lives.
Some 16,700 locals have been evacuated to 24 shelters in Palau.
Aerial images of the disaster management office show demolished homes, shops, broken bridges and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by subterranean tremors.
A series of earthquakes took place in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The statement of the Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) states that the earthquake-induced energy release was about 200 times as high as the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have been stronger than expected, thanks to the geographical location of the city at the end of the long narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as “large-scale”, adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been demolished.
The bodies of the dead were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings; 540 people were injured, and 29 others were reported missing.
Nugroho added that the loss and destruction could be even more significant along the coast to 300 km from Pale, a location in Dungal, which was closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communications from Dungal were “totally destroyed, no information was received”.
“Dungala region has more than 300,000 people,” states the International Committee of the Red Cross in its communiqué, whose staff and volunteers have been on their way to the disaster zone.
“A tragedy has occurred, but this is not the limit,” the report states.
On Saturday, the Authority was severely criticized for not reporting on time the arrival of a tsunami in Palau, but the authorities believe that the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
There's an amateur video on social media, in which a man on the top floor of the building is yelling at an impending tsunami, desperately trying to get people's attention on the street.
In a few minutes, the water wall is on the shore, carrying whole houses and cars.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this video.
Earthquake and the tsunami have led to a major drain of electrolytes, which has left the link in Palau, making rescue operations very difficult.
Military transport planes with humanitarian assistance have been sent from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still lack food and basic necessities, and Government sources report.
The city airport was open for humanitarian assistance only; it will be closed for other flights until October.
President Joko Vidodo will visit the evacuation centres in Pala on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the World Vision Charitable arrived safely from Dungal to Pala, where the staff found a shelter in the tarpaulin tents in the backyard of their office building.
"They've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charitable organizations have begun to put in place humanitarian aid mechanisms, but many have complained that international NCBs have not been able to get to Palau.
Indonesian law only allows for the use of funding, humanitarian assistance and staff of foreign organizations when the location of the disaster has been declared to be a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“This is considered to be a local disaster,” reports Auliya Ariani, Spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government declares a natural disaster to be national, we will be able to receive foreign aid, but so far the status has not changed.”
On the second day of the natural disaster that struck Pala, the friends and relatives of the people who have been reported to be missing still hope for their miraculous salvation, which will give the people their faith in the best.
A little boy who fell into the sewer was rescued on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled a woman from under the rubble of the building, who spent two days there, next to her mother's dead body.
Hendon Subandono, a national para-planetry coach for Indonesia, trained two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian game in Indonesia.
Other people in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
"I'm not the last person in this sport, and it's emotionally hard to get through," he said.
Hendon remembers how, when he learned of the collapse of Roa's hotel from other paralyzers, in the next hours, he was desperately trying to reach out to his colleagues in Palau on the beach festival.
His messages, however, were displayed with one grey tick, not two blues.
“This means that no message has been delivered,” he believes.
Steady theft of US$ 26,750 while maintaining an ATM in Newport on Levi
On Friday morning, the intruders stole 26,750 dollars from the Brink's ATM in Newport on Levi, a press release from the Newport Police.
According to Investigator Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armoured minibus took the cash from an ATM located in the entertainment complex and was about to refill it with new banknotes.
At the time, "Brink's employee ran off the back of the intruder" and stole a bag of banknotes to refuel the ATM.
According to the witnesses to the incident, a number of suspects had fled from the scene, but the police had not indicated the number of potential participants.
A citizen who has any information about these persons is requested to contact the Newport Police Department at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West came up with a new name: Ye.
He announced this on Saturday on Twitter: “A person formerly known as Kanye West.
The 41-year-old West has been wearing this pseudonym for a long time and even put it on the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The news of this was in the run-up to Kanye's appearance in the "Saturday Night Live" show, where he plans to present his new Yandhi album.
Kanye West will be co-hosting Ariana, who has cancelled her participation on the basis of “emotional feelings”, reports the author of the show.
West has previously stated that the pseudonym is not only a shortened version of his name, but also has a religious meaning.
“Ye, the most common word in the Bible, it means you, you, ” West explained the title of his album in a recent interview with Big Boy.
"I mean, I'm you, I'm us.
At first, it was Kanye, which means "the one," and now I'm just Ye, a reflection of all the good, bad, incomprehensible in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to see who we are.
Kanye is not the first known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Deady, Pi Diddy or just Diddy, has this year asked to call himself Love ("love") or Braza Love ("Bruder Love" or "Bruder Love").
He, who spoke to West rapper JZ, also changed his name several times: with a defiance and no, capital or lower letter.
The President of Mexico solemnly pledges not to use military force against the civilian population
President Andres Manuel López Obrador of Mexico vowed never to resort to military force against the civilian population in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration, which led to a bloody confrontation.
On Saturday in Tlatelloco Square, President López Obrador promised to “never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On this site, on 2 October 1968, during a peaceful student demonstration, the first shots were fired at the crowd and a massacre began, killing 300 people, amidst the rise of left-wing student movements in Latin America.
López Obrador also pledged support to Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to study and to open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of learning opportunities led young people directly to the criminal world.
The US needs to double funding for the development of the IDI.
Not to underestimate China's efforts in the field of artificial intelligence – the US has to double investment in its research, as Lee Kaifu, an ISI investor and entrepreneur with experience at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
Previously, a number of US ministries made statements on the II, although the US as a whole does not have a clear strategy for the development of II.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal is to be the first to innovate in the AI by 2030.
“A doubling of the IE research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking forward to a next breakthrough in II,” says Lee.
The increase in funding can double the chances of the next big I.I. in the United States, said to Lee CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "The Superpowers of Artificial Intel: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Director-General of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent ISI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he was working on a system of artificial intelligence that outperformed the highest player in the American Othello, and then he was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee referred to previous US government tech competitions, such as the Robotics Callenge of Defense Advance Research Projects, and enquired when the next competition would be to help find people with non-conventional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
“Not China absorbs academic leaders, but corporations,” Li is convinced.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been hiring a glove from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the US to develop artificial intelligence.
“I think that Green Cards should automatically be offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to scientists in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies are making money available to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Li claims.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, in which partners from industry and academia should be involved, and the White House announced the creation of an Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in an ISI study.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which was trying to set up the National Security Commission on Illness, has not taken any action in this direction for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country to “the Republic of North Macedonia”, which would resolve a multi-year dispute with Greece, which has blocked its applications to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on its territory, and has vetoed its joining NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments entered into an agreement based on a new name, but national opponents claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the turnout would be at a minimum of 50 per cent for the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was as follows: “Do you support the membership of NATO and the EU, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
Proponents of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the break-up of Yugoslavia, is worth paying this price for joining such organizations as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievskaya, a resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of members of Parliament have stated that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive, even though it is not legally binding.
A change of name will require a two-thirds majority of Members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, as compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Yosa Tanevski, an elector from the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will open the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumitz, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje House of Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene, splitting up the chairs in front of the tents set by the citizens who are about to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with our head up, not by swelling the thresholds of the cabinets,” says Kawadarkov.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of self-worth.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zayev says that joining NATO will bring about the investment that is so much needed in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be in favor, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” said Zayev after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be a “fundament of our prosperous future”.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would be in the referendum, but that was lower than the required turnout.
In another interview by the Macedonian Telecom-TV channel, it was found that 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of this number say that they will vote in a positive way.
For the referendum to take place, the turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major blow to the pro-Western Government's policy since it came to power last May.
Look: Sergio Aguiero of Manchester City is playing Briton's defense to score a goal.
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling killed Briton's defense, leading Manchester City to a 2-0 win on Saturday at Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored a goal for the 65th minute, it didn't seem like it was a big deal for him.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker got a pass at the center of the field.
He ran between the three Britons before he got out of the open.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green t-shirts.
He circled one defender and overcame a few more on the edge of the Briton fine zone.
He next handed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English attacker, while in the penalty zone, put in one touch the Aguero ball, which hit the Briton Gatekeeper Matthew Ryan with his right foot in the right corner of the gateway.
“Aguero has a problem with his legs,” said Coach Manchester City, Pep Guardiola.
"We agreed he'd play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at the time.
But Sterling was the one who gave the Celestial Blue the initial advantage in the fight of the Premier League.
That goal was full for the 29th minute.
In this game, Agüero got the ball, deep in Briton's territory.
He's given a great cut-off on the left flank on Leroy Sana'a.
Sanae made a few touches before handing Sterling on a long-distance peg.
The attacker, "Hell-Blue", punched the ball in the gate right before flying out of the field.
Manchester City fought with Hoffhenheim in the League of Champions on Tuesday at 12:55 on the Rhine Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer's gonna take the glasses from Colorado Rockies.
After the Washington Nationals got out of the playoffs, there was no reason to push the events.
But the insatiable Sherzer hopes to win the fight against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, who are ahead of one Los Angeles Dodgers game in the Western Division, have a play-off problem.
The 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies have already won at least 7 or 8th place, but they still hope to secure a title in the First Division.
“Although we play for nothing, at least we can hold our positions, knowing the immense importance of an atmosphere in Denver in the presence of an audience and another team, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss this?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a pitcher for Sunday, but the latest evidence suggests that Sherzer is likely to be in the position to play this role.
Sherzer, about to go to the 34th game, threw a ball at the pitcher playground on Thursday, and on Sunday, on his day off, he'll be a pitcher.
The statistics for the Washington ruler are 18-7, with ERA 2.53 and 300 outs in 220 2/3 innings in the current season.
Trump is running an election in West Virginia.
Referring to the importance of the Republican turnout in the interim elections, the President implicitly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Cavanaugh, a presidential nomination to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks left to one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's very, very important. I don't run, though I do run, fighting for good candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means they need, and we see vileness and abhorrentness.
They don't care who they're gonna hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control, and that's what they want -- power and control, but we're not gonna give it to them.
The Democrats, he states, have been set up to “oppose and hinder”.
“And you've been watching it for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “vilest, vile, vile, and false.
He referred to the Senate Juridical Committee, referring to the Senator-Democrat Diane Feinstein, which caused a loud outcry from the hall.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the content of this document?
Um... um... what kind of document?
No, no, the language of the body has given it up, I've never seen the language of the body so disprove the words."
The Labour Party is no longer an organization of diverse views.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party proposed a vote of distrust to me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of the members of Parliament from the Labour Party, who have not yet been told that we are not welcome for expressing our views.
A similar attitude to my colleague in the Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she was very strong against anti-Semiticism.
In my case, a vote of distrust was critical of me for dissenting Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security, and Europe — ironically, the issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham Eastern Labour Assembly report on Friday said, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Labour Party, the evening meetings of the GC were like this.
Sadly, today’s tone is not in line with many of the meetings, and the promise of a “more human and soft” policy has long been forgotten, if ever.
The fact that there are no differences of opinion in the Labour Party is becoming more and more evident, and every opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable to the party ' s leadership.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader; my colleagues, whose political perspective I previously considered to be similar to my own, began to expect me to make a fundamental change in my views and take a position that I would never agree to, be it national security or a single EU market.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a tirade of insults on social media that call for the annulment of the election, which denounces the center's policy, or that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the comments to me do tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face every day a wave of attacks on sexual or racist grounds, but never give up.
Most frustrating in this policy is the fact that such a number of insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “broad church, ” and with every vote of distrust or a change in the rules of choice, the party has become a party.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of recommendations calling for me to sit down and cut my voice, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I'm in politics.
Since I joined the Laborists 32 years ago, as a student of a school, indignant at the Government of Thatcher's disregard for which my school class has literally fallen apart, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who need it most, whether as a local deputy or as a minister of government.
I've never concealed my political views, I've never done it in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say the following: my country is so hard to move towards Brexit, which will cause economic, industrial and public losses, and I do not understand the will of some to spend their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience I'd like to address is not Nottingham Modernum, but my constituents, whether or not they're laborers: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise you that any threat to cancel the election or political expediency will not prevent me from doing what I think is necessary in your interest.
Chris Lesley, Member of Parliament for Nottingham East County
Ear 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible "Er" is ranked first
The two late attempts may have misled the final result, but there is no doubt that the Er has won a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Tennenth Premier League match.
Now they're heading a table, the only invincible team of tens.
After all, all thanks to their excellent protection, as well as their ability to pick the right moment, which gave Peter Merchi's host team and coach the right to be content.
“All this time we have been tested for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad,” Peter Merchi commented.
Robin Christie, Melrose: "It's good to pay tribute to "Ear," they've done better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Fresher Climo led "Ear" forward, but the yellow card released for the "Wories" game by Scotland's player, Rory Hughes, allowed Melrose to move forward, and Jason Buggott took the unrealized try.
Climo widened the "Ear" off the laureate before, right in the middle of the game, he made a point, and then in the break, he made a single attempt, making an account of 17-5 in favor of the "Ear".
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's Bughot shot shortened the break-up to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the severe trauma to Ruarid Knott, who was stretched, and after a re-entry, "Er" moved on with a try by Stafford McDowell, which was carried out by Climo.
The active captain of Air, Blair McPherson, then got the yellow card, and again Melrose made the rivals pay for Bruce Colvin's unfulfilled attempt at the end of a period of violent pressure.
Still, the hosts returned, and when Strawan Hutchinson got a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without a ball from the line of the penalty line, MacPherson made a touchdown behind the coming Molo "Er".
Climo realized an advantage, not to stop at the very last exit, after Kyle Rowe was hit by David Armstrong and sent the extreme attacker, Gregor Henry, to the fifth attempt of the field.
Star Still Game is about to start a new career in the restaurant business.
The star, Still Game Ford Kieran, is about to start work in the hotel industry, and it has become known that he has been appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, for which he also writes, and is filmed with a long-time comedy partner, Greg Hamfile.
The duo announced that the next 9th episode would be the last on the show, and it looks like Kirnan's planning a life after Craigslist.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan was planning to take part in the "blissing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
The Sea of Ours: a land-locked Bolivia hopes that the Court will re-open the path to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patrolling a naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are blue flags on public buildings.
The navy bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are marked with a slogan: "The sea is right.
It is our duty to return it.
Throughout Bolivia, which is a land-locked country, the memory of the shoreline that has been lost in Chile ' s favor as a result of the 19th century bloody conflict over resources is still alive; the desire to re-enter the Pacific.
Those hopes may have been the most bold in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of an international court to be held on 1 October in the wake of five years of debate.
“ Bolivia has an energy, a spirit of unity, and a mental balance, and, of course, a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice ruling on screens all over the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will be able to support Bolivia ' s statement that, after decades of intensive negotiations, Chile has a duty to negotiate for Bolivia ' s sovereign land.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of the Bolivian indigenous peoples, who is waging a hard fight for re-election next year, is also in a state of resentment for a decision to be made on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
Some analysts believe, however, that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if so, it will not change much.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no power to control Chilean territory and has already stated that it will have no effect on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was rendered only six months after the last argument was heard indicates that the case was “not complicated, ” says Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And for the past four years, the Bolivian case has not progressed, and vice versa, it has been postponed all the time.
“The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarate says.
According to her, Morales' war rhetoric destroyed the last of Chile's benevolentness.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to engage in discussions.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagreed with the fact that the court decision was delivered too fast.
Monday will give Bolivia “a unique opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to“ put an end to the 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit, ” he states.
Calzadilla also disagrees with the fact that Morales, still one of Latin American’s most popular presidents, is using the maritime problem as a political tool.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he states.
“The decision of the court is an opportunity to make sure once again that we have to go through our past.”
North Korea states that there will be no nuclear disarmament until it can trust the US.
North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Young-ho, states that his country will never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri addressed the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to live up to the promises made at the Singapore summit among its leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is gradually re-entering the path of the resumption of stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Eun in Singapore.
Ree claims that the dream of long-term sanctions and US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever put the North on its knees is a utopia.
Washington fears the adoption of this declaration if Pyongyang does not take significant steps on disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But skepticism about Pyongyang's taking the abandonment of the arsenal, which the country may view as the only way to guarantee its security, is commonplace.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows the newest line of massive headwear, which are expected to appear in the mass market, and will be worn right next to you.
If you want to add your hats to your collection or to fully protect yourself from the sunlight, there's no need to look for something else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a number of unusual headwear, which are part of their SS19 collection and blinded fashion week visitors in Paris.
This summer, very impractical hats won the popularity of Instagram subscribers, and designers decided to send their stunning creations to the runway.
A distinct exemplar of Valentino: The head beige decoy, decorated with wide-fed-like fields, was painted on model headlines.
Other massive accessories included jeweled watermelons, a magician's hat, and even pineapples, but all of these headwear are not designed to warm up the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also introduced to the world a collection of bizarre masks, which had to be the eve of Halloween.
A lot of these petal masks were sewn up in their mouths, and they were more like Hannibal Lecturer's picture than the couture.
One was like underwater equipment with pipes and sunglasses, and the other was a melting ice cream.
If you're a fan of high fashion, you're lucky.
Mode critics foretell that these big hats have every chance of getting into the mass market, right up to you.
The top size hats follow the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with a two-foot wide field, all of which has been worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The Cult label, which has released this very impractical hat, which has won so much popularity on social media, has created and sent to go on the runway another huge accessory, a straw beach bag, almost as big as a bathing suit that carries this bag.
An orange bag of razor-burned raffia with a white leather pen and a line of raffia became a bright copy of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 fashion week in Paris.
Celebrist Luke Armitage says to FEMAIL: "I think big hats and beach bags will come out in mass sale next summer, and since the designer has made this kind of stuff, it would be very hard to ignore the demand for massive accessories.
John Edward: Languages are of great importance to the world's citizens
Scotland ' s independent schools are continuing with the tradition of brilliant education, which was again confirmed in 2018, with outstanding examinations showing individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other socially relevant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 pupils are enrolled throughout Scotland, and seek to provide the highest level of services for pupils and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their pupils for further higher education, their careers, and the status of the world ' s citizens.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the design and implementation of the individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you call on his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, you turn to his heart."
This is a strong proof that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to have a relationship with and trust the people of other countries.
From the last exams of this year, we see that languages are in the top position in the league table and have the highest score in the independent school exams.
A total of 68 per cent of foreign-language students received the highest A rating.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of the pupils received “A” in Mandarin (Chinese language), while 72 per cent of students in German, 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish also received “A”.
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are no doubt considered vital for children and young people in the future.
At present, language subjects enjoy the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and math in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17 per cent of the reasons that created difficulty for employers in filling job vacancies were due to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given the fact that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what kind of profession a student chooses, if he learns a second language, in the future he will have a real advantage by learning another skill that he will benefit from throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically offers a competitive advantage to a person who has a knowledge of several foreign languages.
According to a survey by YouTube, in which more than 4,000 British adults participated in 2013, 75 per cent were not able to speak well enough in a foreign language to support a conversation, and French was the only language with a two-digit rate — 15 per cent of the respondents.
That's why investing in language education is so relevant now.
Knowledge of a number of languages, especially those of countries with emerging economies, would give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, there is a wide range of languages that are taught, with each school having a different set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach the languages that are considered to be the most important to Britain in the light of the future of the country before 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, in independent schools there will always be a choice of a number of languages with a teaching staff whose members are specialists in those languages.
Scotland ' s independent schools seek to create an educational environment that will train children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what their future may be.
At present, it cannot be denied that, in the global business environment, languages are still vital to the country ' s future development, so this should be appropriately reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages do need to be viewed as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, ensuring the diversity and benefits of Scotland ' s youth.
Il faunt byen le fire.
John Edwards, Director, Board of Independent Schools of Scotland
LeBron debuts at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The woeful expectation of fans to see LeBron James go to Los Angeles Lakers for the first time has almost come to an end.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play a pre-season Sunday match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we still have to figure out how much time it has to take.
"More than one or less than forty-eight," he replied on the official Lakers Web site.
Reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a short time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six pre-season games on the Lakers chart.
"I don't need pre-season games to get ready for the season at this stage of my career," the player replies.
Trump's pre-electoral race in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of pre-electoral meetings tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Trump meetings next week, including visiting friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on the candidate he has proposed for the position of Supreme Justice has been postponed, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote is held in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Wiling, West Virginia, will take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting with Western Virginia voters online live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be speaking at this week's hearing to nominate his candidate, Brett Cavanaugh, for the position of Supreme Justice, and Trump's proposal has led to a lot of negative reactions, as Cavanaugh has been charged with sexual harassment, and the vote to be held in the Senate will be postponed for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main aim of this action is to help the Republicans who are going to the November elections to step up the electoral momentum.
So President Trump's campaign is to get the five meetings to be held next week to help “energize the work of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” writes Reuters.
“The control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the President has to visit as many states as possible, as we are entering a busy campaign season,” Trump’s campaign press secretary, who has refused to be called, reports Reuters.
The action planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Wilinga can attract supporters from "...Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
Visiting West Virginia Trump this Saturday is the second visit to this state in the last month, where it won an advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia senator Patrick Morrisy, who is behind in the polls.
“The fact that in order for Morrisy to get ahead of the poll competitors, the president has to come is not a good sign for Morris himself,” says Simon Heder, a politician at the University of West Virginia (reuters quote).
Rider Cup 2018: The U.S. Congregation is ready to fight and has the hope to go to a match on Sunday.
After three one-off sessions, the Saturday game, two-to-two, may have been exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The moving initiative is an exceptional fictional sporting concept, but it is in which the players believe, and it is particularly prominent in such competitions.
So who has the initiative?
"They had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I think it's a small initiative for us," Jordan Spit said.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage, and 12 more on the line.
The Americans, in Spit's view, feel the wind in sails, and they have reason to keep the spirit up, not least because of the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and everyone can brag with three out of four.
Sleeping was constant from you to the green, and it was a personal example.
The victories were getting louder as his round continued, kicking the critical ball in the hole, closing the match when he and Thomas gave up two by two.
His blow, which gave them a victory in the game on the 15th hole, was met with a similar audacity, one of the ones that speaks of his belief in a chance for the American team.
“We need to get together and focus on our own game,” commented Spit.
That's all the players have left.
Go through 18 holes and win.
The only players who have earned more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undeniably in the history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe hit four out of four, and they don't seem to know the wrongs.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't get a boga on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the boga on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again on Friday morning.
Such a series, and the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the wild fans, builds on the belief that they will not be defeated on Sunday, and when the sun hides behind the horizon of the "Le Golf National" field, there will be no more famous player who anchors Europe’s potential victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It'd be great if both of us were on different holes at the same time.
But it is too early to talk about Europe’s glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quick to deal with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball morning hero, when he was in a relationship with Alex Noren.
The boggs and the two double boggs on the first nine holes dug a Spaniard and a Swedish hole from which they were never able to get out.
So on Sunday, no one's gonna help you get out of your hole.
It's so exciting to watch a four-ball game and a four-player game because of the interplay between the pairs, the tips they're sharing, and they're deliberately silent, and how the strategy can change in a moment.
So far, Europe has played better than a team, and it's made a lot of headway on the last day, but this session has also shown that the US team has the strength to fight, which some, especially in America, have doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads with a score of 10-6
Europe will have a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after the end of the four-ball and four-ball Saturdays with a 10-6 over the United States.
Inspired duet by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against the two victories of the battering Tiger Woods to bring the bill to "Le Golf National" to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to return the trophy lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the error-proceeding American team in the four-ball game of the morning, winning the 3-1 score.
The U.S. has shown more resistance in the fours by winning two matches, but they have not been able to narrow the gap in the account.
Jim Ferrick's team needs eight points from the 12 Sunday match to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who got the nickname "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, were only the second pair to win four points in the first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they were then brilliantly united to win the fallen spirit of Woods and American new Bryson Dechochmo with even more resolute 5/4.
Woods, who had completed two Saturdays, had splashes from time to time, but he now lost 19 of the 29 four-ball matches, and the four four in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested before the four-ball game of the morning, returned to Henrik Stanson's four-year-old partner, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Cap, with a count of 2/1, ranked first and third in the world.
For Europe, the game was not an easy and enjoyable walk by a refreshing day south-west of Paris.
The three-time champion Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas made two points for Americans on Saturday.
They won a strong 2/1 win against the Spaniards, John Ram and Ian Polter, in a four-ball game, and returned later to win Polter and Rory McElroy with 4/3 in fours, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team got out of a four-point lag, out on its own, given that Ferrick's team, as hosts, needed to play a single game to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of holding second place, the counterattack on Sunday looks like it's beyond their reach.
North Korea says that “kategorily” will not be disarmed unilaterally without trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said to the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions had increased the distrust of the United States, and that his country would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under any circumstances.
Ri Young-ho stated at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted “substantial good-will measures” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of the nuclear test site, and a commitment not to build up nuclear weapons and not to develop nuclear technology.
"But we don't see a symmetrical response from the US," he said.
“Untrusting the US will not be a certainty of our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able to be the first to take action on disarmament unilaterally.”
While Ri echoed the North Korean complaints already made against Washington's “phased” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for step-by-step steps, his statement was important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ree referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the current US President and North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June; Kim then promised to start a movement towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” and Trump promised North Korea security assurances.
North Korea is trying to put an end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States states that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington is also resisting calls for the relaxation of strong international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that “first denuclearization must take place” and increases the level of pressure through sanctions for the enforcement of its purpose, and even opposes“ the declaration of the end of the war, ” says Ree.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is the utopian dream of people who don't know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions are reinforcing our distrust.
Ree did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae In over the past five months and added: “Had South Korea been a party to the issue of denuclearization, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been so stalled.”
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was starkly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korean missile targeting the United States mainland was inevitable after Trump called Kim a “suicide missile.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “make a complete end to ” North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take action on disarmament, but said that much remained to be done, and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't mean any time frame for the process: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue to be active and mandatory until we see full, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an effort to cut off the financing of Pyongyang ' s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly summit and, after the meeting, announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea had denounced him for “bang demands”.
North Korea, at a meeting with Moon this month, has promised to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States, for its part, takes “the appropriate measures”.
According to Kim, the “appropriate measures” he was talking about were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions to normalize his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest in special classes
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, has helped all primary students to learn to sleep more and to combat the chauvinist culture of continuous caffeine use in order to keep up “nights through.
One of the academics found that the world’s most successful students often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Briggham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first in the United States.
After his discovery, he was aroused by the idea of introducing such a course, giving a preliminary report on the impact of sleep deprivation on the learning process.
"At the end of my presentation, a girl came to me and said, "I'm so sorry I didn't know about it until I'm about to finish my studies. "
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which amazed me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first offered to students this year, describes how the habit of a healthy sleep contributes to academic and sports performance, as well as how it improves the general health of the individual.
Paul Barrera, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University's Health Service, said that the University had decided to introduce the course after it had been determined that the students were in serious sleep deprivation during the school week.
The class lasts one hour, and the student performs a number of interactive tasks.
A section of the class provides an image of a dormitory room, where students, by clicking on cups, curtains, simulators, and books, learn how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light, which causes a lack of sleep — have an impact on sports results, and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In another section, participants learn how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The online campus map prompts participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behaviour of the students at once.
But we believe that they have a right to know, as everyone else has a right to know, for example, how smoking affects their health,” Professor Chessler added.
He said that a false sense of pride for “smelling all night ” is still common, and modern technology, as is the growing pressure on students, means that sleep deprivation is a problem.
He said that enough sleep of good quality is a student's “secret weapon” to deal with stress, nervous exhaustion, and anxiety, and even to deal with overweight, as under-slapping puts the brain in a mode of hunger, putting it in a constant state of hunger.
Raymond Sow, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chasler to design a course by attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to distribute this information to the entire campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all postgraduates to take a similar curriculum before going to a competitive school.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students set up an alarm to warn them to go to bed and wake up, as well as to remember the harmful effect of the “blue light” produced by electronic screens and LEDs, which disrupts human biorite and leads to problems of sleep.
Livingstone 1-0 Rangers: The Hall of Menga wins over Gerrard's team
The Rangers experienced another sad retreat, as the goal of Dolly Meng led Stephen Gerrard's unassembled team to a 1-0 in Livingstone.
The Aybrox team was hoping to win their first 4-1 win on the way out in St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team only defeated Gerrard of 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind, handing over a light win to the Harts team, the Scottish Premier League leaders.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who had lost their spirit, did not seem to plan to level the score.
While Rangers has now fallen to number six, Livingstone has moved to number three, and has only given up to Hibernian by the ratio of head-colds.
And the Rangers may have more problems after the linear judge Kalum Spence has had to heal the head wound after an object was thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight replacements for the team that went through "Ear" to the semi-finals for the Scots League Cup.
Holt, in turn, went with the same Livi 11 strategy, which widened the gap with the Harts last week, and he would be glad to see how his well-stressed members put the opponents down at every step.
The Rangers may have been led in the possession of the sword, but Livingstone was pressed much more when the ball hits them.
They were supposed to score a goal in just two minutes, when the first handing over to Meng Scott Pittman was stopped by Allan McGregor, but the half-defendant took the chance.
Keegan Jacobs struck the captain of the team, Craig Hulkett, but his defense partner, Alan Litgoe, was only able to send the ball to the back pan.
The Rangers have intercepted control, but in the last third, there seems to have been more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was sure he was gonna hit the 45th minute when he and Stephen Lowless ran into each other, but Judge Stephen Thomson disagreed with the Colombian statement.
The Rangers made only two hits in the first half of time, but the former Ibrox Gatekeeper, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about the hit by Lassan Kulibali's head, and the weak hit by Ovi Ejaria.
Although Livy's first goal, hit for the 34th minute, may not be in line with the game, no one can deny that they have earned it exclusively by their own work.
But again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' standard position.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried hard to get the ball to Meng to complete.
Gerrard went on a break when he traded the Kulibali for Ryan Kent, and that change almost immediately came off when the extreme halfback gave up Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to interrogate.
But Livingstone continued to involve the guests in a game they planned with Litgow and Hulkett, constantly doing long shows.
Holt's team was trying to expand the break-out in the final stages, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Litgoe passed out from the corner of the field.
The Rangers spare player, Glenn Middleton, once again demanded a kick after he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson again refused.
Almanah: Geiger's Inventor
And now the page of our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, a future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
As one of the fundamentals of science, Geiger's teller also became one of the fundamentals of a popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film "Column of the Coronado", with the cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who seem to be different from scientists, in the main roles:
Man: "What the hell is this thing?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger's numerator, used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear the effect of atoms from radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Here, I can hear you right now!"
He died in 1945 before his 63th birthday.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
A new vaccine for cancer can teach the immune system to “see” abnormal cells
A new anti-cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" abnormally growing cells and kill them.
Part of the treatment of the vaccine is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
The method is to extract the patient ' s immune cells and change them in laboratory settings.
As a result of this change, cells are able to “see” the type of protein that is common to many types of cancer, and then the cells have to be reintroduced.
The test vaccine shows promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
One of the patients who was introduced to this vaccine, and whose immune system has been able to recognize abnormal cells, has been in remission for over 18 months.
The method is to extract the patient's immune cells and to change them in the laboratory environment, after which the modified cells can “see” HER2 proteins that are common to many cancers, and then the modified cells are re-introduced to the patient.
Professor J. Berzofski, U.S. National Institute for Research on Cancer, Bethesda, Maryland, states: "The results we have inferred, we have a very promising vaccine."
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorful cancer.
A similar method was used successfully in the treatment of leukaemia, which was to take immunocells from patients and to “teach them ” how to influence cancer cells.
Kanye West defended Trump in the MAGA cap after his appearance in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was in the studio during a Saturday concert at which he spoke for US President Donald Trump, claiming that he would re-enter the position in 2020.
After performing his third song, "City Ghost", which he put on his "Make America Great Again" cap, the performer spoke against the Democrats and supported Trump.
"Very often I talk to white people, and they ask me, "How can you support Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago," the performer said.
The SNL channel made a parody show with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Court Committee on Christina Blacey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
The TV didn't show how the crowd resented West's statement, but this video was uploaded on social media by a comedian Chris Rock.
Now it's not clear if Rock was trying to make West laugh.
In addition, West complained to the public that his hat was being laughed at behind the scenes.
"They've been messing with me behind the stage.
They say don't go out in that hat.
They're really messing with me!
Washington Examiner quotes: "They also said that my position was not cool."
West goes on to say, "Do you want to know what's not cool? Put on a superman's cape so no one can tell you what to do? Do you want the world to continue to grow?
Then you need love."
His comments, at least twice, drew the attention of the audience, and the members of the SNL cast seemed to be confused, and one man said to the publisher, "The entire studio is in silence."
Westa was last invited to replace the singer Ariane Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper mc Miller, died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of the song "I Love it" in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest people: SERVANT TO SUPPORT THEM."
Karen Hunter, the host of the talk show, tweeted that West was just "what he is, and it's absolutely wonderful."
“But I do not want to support anyone (buying his music, dress, or otherwise supporting his creativity) who, in my view, shares and propagates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
Like us," she said.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddie's footsteps, also known as Puff Duddy, Puffy, and Pi Diddy.
His co-workers, the rapper Snoop Dog, had the name of Snoop Lyon, and another example is, of course, an artist who has recently become a legend, the Prince, who has changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist formerly known as the Prince.
Attempted murder for scissors at the Belfast Restaurant.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of stab wounds in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhakamor, as reported by the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of Justice on Monday.
The charges will be heard by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
The star of the "Sons of Throne" Kit Harington is attacking a toxic mask.
Keith Harington is known for his role as the swinging sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval HBO "Soon game" fantasy show.
However, a 31-year-old actor recently critically criticized the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such characters often inculcate young people in the idea that to be respected, you must be brutal.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thought "something went wrong," and he wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Whale, who recently married a co-worker in "The Game of Thrones", Rose Lesley, who was his age, admitted that he was "very fond of" the problem.
“I take this question very seriously: where are we wrong about the perception of masculinity?”, the actor asks.
"What do we teach young people that we have such a problem today?"
Whale thinks that TV can be partly responsible for this splash of toxic masculinity because of too muscular characters.
The actor goes on to say, "What's inborn and what's acquired?
What do you learn on TV and on the street, making young men feel like they're only supposed to be on one particular side of masculinity?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because today with young people, something's really wrong.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not take part in any of the spells or sequels of the game of Thrones, after the show ended next summer, saying that he had “finished the battles and the horses. ”
Since November, Keith will play a major role in the re-enacting "The True West" by Sam Shepard, who is talking about the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently announced that he believed that meeting Rose's wife was the best finale of the "Sons of Throne" for him.
"I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my life," the actor says.
Rose played the Player, an object of passion for the character Keith John Snow in a Phenthesian show, awarded Emmy's award.
The couple celebrated a wedding in June 2018 at the Lesley Family Manor in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health representatives, more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering from these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been sexually transmitted, which is a sign of a change in the trends of the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV-infected people in this way has been reduced to almost zero, and Chinese health representatives at a conference in Yunnan.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is growing by 100,000 every year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a major problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is still widespread.
Studies confirm that, due to the country ' s conservative values, 70 to 90 per cent of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to the lack of protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters disproves the information about the leak of information from the Republican Senators' fault, complaining of “threatening lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Member of the U.S. Parliament, Maxine Waters, on Saturday, rejected the charges that one of her employees had posted personal information to three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia of Lawmakers.
The L.A. Democrat claims that the claims were forged by ultra-right experts and websites.
“Liables, lies, and even more vile lies,” Waters tweets.
It is reported that the published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of US senators, Lyndsey Graham, South California, Mike Lee, and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information was made available on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing before the Senate Sexual Harassment Commission against a candidate in the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh.
The leak occurred a while after three senators interrogated Cavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identified the source of the messages was linked to Waters' office, and made available information about Waters' employees, reports Hill.
“This unsubstantiated claim is completely false,” Waters assures us.
“A member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent actions, was in no way responsible for the diversion of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a total lie."
Waters' statement prompted online criticism, including by former White House Spokesman Ari Fleisher.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleisher writes.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for working in Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why be mad?
You don't have to justify yourself either.
And you don't have to look at the motives of the prosecution either.
We need to stay cool and cool.
Fleiser seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters' place in the mid-term, also made his point on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very important," he writes.
In his statement, Waters writes that her office has warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these frauds.
“We will see to it that the perpetrators are found,” she writes, “and that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which can be destructive and dangerous to all of my employees.”
Johnny English hits again - a weak impression on Rowan Atkinson's spy
Today, it is a custom to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film that in one way or another features Britain, and this is also true of the new parallel spy franchise, "Agent Johnny English", which began production in 2003 and continued in 2011 with "Agent Johnny English: Rebooting".
Will a self-inflicted picture of the "we're all shitty" label become a new national export attempt?
In any event, Johnny English, a blind-eyed profan with a rubber face, got his right to chaos for the second time -- his name is the best hint of being a wide-screened comedy for a non-English movie audience.
The hero, of course, is a dumb secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim for a glamorous smoothie, got a bit of Clouseau, Mr. Bean's traits, and a portion of this guy, who put one single note in a chariot of Fire tune in London in 2012 at the opening of the Olympics.
Originally, the character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveler and the mysterious "international" Atkinson, who once played in the now-forgotten barclaycard television commercial, in which the hero left a complete chaos.
In this last issue of JE, there are one or two good moments.
I was very fond of the scene when Johnny English was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the splashes popped on his helmet.
Yes, it shows Atkinson's gift to the physical execution of comedy scenes, but humor itself seems rather weak and bizarrely superfluous, especially because such “serious” motion shots as the Agency 007 and the Mission Impossible are now very confidently offering comedy as an element.
It's like humor is for kids, not for adults, and for me, Johnny English's bizarre villains are not as ingenious and relevant as Atkinson's jokes in Mr. Bean's movies.
The constant message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber-hacker infiltrated a top-secret British spy network, uncovering the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of an on-call agent, Kevin Eldon, here, unfortunately, has a sporadic role.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, a pompous and persuasive figure already suffering from massive political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best for the character Quasi-Teresa-May, but there's nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisors tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of retirement.
And here on the stage is the clumsy Johnny English himself, who is now a schoolteacher in some fancy institution, but also gives informal lessons on secret operating: there are a few good jokes, as English offers the skills of a spy Academy in the rock style.
English is going back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is reunited with his ex-unfortunate friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller this time.
Buff is now a married man under the command of a submarine, the role of a “happy hockey club, ” in which Vicky Pepperdin is a bit lost.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game, because Her Majesty's Secret Service has made terrible mistakes, and they face a beautiful, fatal woman, Ophelia Bulletova, in the performance of Olga Curilenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously enchanted by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, the sinister Jason Volta, who Jake Lacey is playing.
Inglish and Buff are starting their odyssey of farce jokes: masked as a waiter, they're burning up a French restaurant; they're creating chaos by smuggling themselves on a luxurious Volt yacht; and they're creating a complete anarchy, trying to use the garnish of virtual reality to get to know the interior of Volt's house.
All of these scenes are, of course, a sweet and funny fiction, but there's something very childish about all of this.
Quite moderate things.
And, like with Johnny English, I couldn't help but think, "Can't the British movie industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that is really commensurate with his talent?
Laborers deny that they are developing a plan to reduce the British work week to four days for a five-day wage.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is about to consider a radical plan, according to which the British will work four days a week, but pay in five days.
The Party is reported to want company leaders to give employees the savings from the Revolutionary Artificial Intelligence, giving them an extra day off.
This would enable staff to enjoy three days off for the same salary.
Sources reported that the idea was “corresponding” to the party's economic agenda and would help the country's population to become part of the workforce.
The Congress of Trade Unions has approved a four-day working week so that workers can benefit from a changing economy.
A high-level source of the Labour Party said The Sunday Times: The policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is our goal, which is in line with the Party's approach to altering the balance of the economy in favour of the workers, as well as the Party's overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party has promised a four-day working week during its campaign in 2017.
However, this will is currently not endorsed by the majority of the Labour Party.
A representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered by the Party”.
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to focus on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to rob the power of the “faceless directors” and the “prospectors” of the utilities.
The plans of the Shadow Chanceller also mean that the current water canal shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Labour Government can make “deducts” on the basis of alleged misdemeanours.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in company boards and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10 per cent of private sector capital to workers who would receive an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lyndsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes," if the FBI's investigation of Cavanaugh can change their mind.
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the post of Supreme Justice for at least a week and raised the question of whether the agency's findings could prompt any of the Republican senators to support Cavanaugh.
In an interview on Sunday, a 60-minute reporter, Scott Pellley, interviewed the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lyndsey Graham, to see if the FBI could find anything to make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," JFK replied.
“I was going to the meeting and I was talking to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and this information popped up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
His response was strong, clear and clear.
But Graham's opinion in the vote has been inviolable.
“I have made a firm determination about Brett Cavanaugh, and my view can be changed only by arguments that are comparable to the force of action, except dynamite,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I know for sure is that Brett strongly denied all of this," he added, "by talking to Christina Blacey Ford.
“No one she called as a witness was able to confirm these facts either.
It's been 36 years.
And I didn't see anything new about it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event in which an impressive starry, with an equally impressive mission, is the end of global poverty.
For the seventh year of the World's Citizens' Festival, as tens of thousands of people are streaming on the big lawn of Central Park, but not just to enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendez, and to share the real goal of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a follow-up to the global anti-poverty project of an international group of human rights defenders, which hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are active in fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you're not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), you have to volunteer or send an e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call, or do any other or other meaningful action to help raise awareness of your goal of putting an end to poverty.
But how successful has the 12-year World Citizens' Festival been in achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people free to attend a concert really to convince fellow citizens to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism”, where people believe that they are making real changes by signing an online petition or posting a message on Twitter?
The organizers of the Global Citizen claim that, since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been recorded at the festival by its supporters, who have a number of different goals.
It is mentioned that, as a result of these actions, world leaders have pledged more than $37 billion, which will have an impact on the lives of more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which have been paid or collected.
The group estimated that the funds provided directly to nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important commitments is The Power of Nutrition: The British Partnership of Investors and Introducers, committed to “helping children to unlock their full potential,” has pledged 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help put an end to malnutrition in the district, which was done after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens, such as you, we can do social injustices to the undernourished past history,” said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions had been taken to call on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government had announced funding for the “Family Power” project, which would cover 5 million women and children through activities to improve nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival's website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen organizers say, "This will be a long and arduous way to stumble and fall from time to time.
But, as in the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Jeanelle Mone, are some of the artists who will be at this year's event in New York, and their hosts will be Deborah-Lee Fernez and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the navy to use “blocks” to prevent the export of Russian energy: the Minister of the Interior
US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has stated that Washington can use its navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from falling into the markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia's presence in Syria, especially where it is acting at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to trade in energy as they do in Eastern Europe, in Southern Europe,” he says.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this problem.
“The United States, together with our navy, has the opportunity to open up sea lanes and, if necessary, to block their energy from entering the market,” the Minister says.
Zinke reached out to an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is positioning itself as a "speaker of the energy user" in the United States.
He next compares Washington’s approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are in fact the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less effective in the use and replacement of fuel,” states the minister, calling Russia a one-trick, whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements were made in connection with the Trump administration ' s objective to increase the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump’s officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the “unustainable” North Stream-2 pipeline project, which, Trump said, made Berlin a “minder” of Moscow.
In Moscow, it has been stressed on several occasions that the 11-billion-dollar North Stream 2 project, which has to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s ferocious resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to select suppliers,” said the Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Nowak, after a meeting with US Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, in September in Moscow.
The US position has led to a negative reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists in the Federation of the German Industry (BDI) called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third state interferes with our energy supply, it poses a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of the German Industry (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator for Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, will carefully explore the possibility of a presidential run in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts announced on Saturday that he would carefully explore the possibility of running for the presidency after an interim election.
At a meeting of the city duma in Holioca, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was going to think about taking part in the election.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and it's about a woman up there,” Warren The Hill says.
“After 6 November, I will give careful consideration to the possibility of running for president.”
Warren so appreciated the work of President Donald Trump during the meeting: “This district will go in the wrong direction.”
"I'm so worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is an open critic of both Trump himself and his candidate for the position of Supreme Justice Brett Cavanaugh.
In his Twitter account on Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, we need to conduct an FBI investigation before we go to the vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday revealed that most of the voters themselves do not think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Policy Studies, 58% of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not run.
By contrast, 32 per cent of the respondents supported her plans.
The poll showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections, and 48 per cent opposed.
Other known names of the Democrats, which have been discussed in the context of the 2020 Vision, include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden states that he will make a formal decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin told me about Trak Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at a meeting with Donald Trump's constituents.
Track Palin, 26, joined the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is going through the same thing as other family members who have been injured by PTSD, and our soldiers are coming back with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as a “eye-in-the-eye” and said about her son and other war veterans: "They're already coming back with another one, heated up, asking if the same respect is shown to their comrades, soldiers, pilots, and any other military they've given to their country."
Trak Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with family violence against a woman, intertwined with violence and possession of a gun in a state of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and D.C. support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy, which prohibits shelter for victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts filed an analytical note in Washington on Friday by a court adviser on support for an asylum-seeker challenging the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Union of Civil Liberties in August against federal policy, is not publicized.
The woman claims that her civilian husband “and his sons, who are members of a criminal group,” ill-treated her, but on 20 July the U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have a large number of applications for asylum in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy on asylum has overturned the decision of the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants to file an application for asylum.
The Attorney-General of Columbia, Carl Racine, stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “negotiates decades of application of State, federal and international law”.
“Federal law requires all applications for asylum to be heard on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” states the report of the court counsel.
Lawyers also argue that the policy against entry of immigrants is detrimental to the US economy, emphasizing that it is this category of citizens who are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labour”.
In June, the Attorney-General, Jeff Sashnes, ordered the immigration judges no longer to grant safe haven to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
“The shelter will be granted to those who leave their country for reasons of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or for political reasons,” said Cashence in his statement of 11 June.
This instrument has never been designed to address all the problems, even the most serious, that people face every day in the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Palau: the number of deaths is double in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation has become more and more difficult.
"It's very hard now," says a 35-year-old mom named Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick baby in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palau.
"Emergency is bringing in the wounded every minute.
Clean water is in a big deficit.
People go back to their broken homes, dig in wet things, and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals affected by an earthquake of 7.5 have been overburdened.
Some of the wounded, including Movi Harris, who had a spine and shoulder fracture, rested near the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated in the open air because they were forced to leave the premises because of the continued strong push.
He's crying, remembering how a massive earthquake destroyed a hotel room on the fifth floor he was filming with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I was squeezed in the rubble of the wall, ” says Harris, explaining that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife yell for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our kid.
I hope that they have been spared, and now they are all right.”
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of “attacks” carried out through “advertising”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published four-page commercials in a daily American newspaper on the mutual benefit of US-China trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to a fee-paying supplement to Des Moines Register China Dailie, the largest commercial newspaper in Iowa, blaming China for an attempt to interfere in the US Congress elections on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to intervene in the U.S. election is proof of the fact that US officials have told Reuters: a new phase is under way in Washington's ever-growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is the norm for foreign governments to post ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now in a state of escalation of trade war, which has led to a levelling of import tariffs for their countries.
China’s response rate at the start of the trade war was to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claims that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers, and business.
China, in an article published in Sunday’s Sunday magazine Des Moines Register, writes Branstad, “now doubles this harassment by posting propaganda in our own free press.
“In propagating its propaganda, the Chinese government is making use of the American tradition of free speech and free press, paying and posting ads at Des Moins Register,” writes Branstad.
“But in the newsstands here on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear dissenting voices, and you will not see the true diversity of views that the Chinese could learn about China’s worrying economic policy, since the local media are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he writes.
He also added that one of the best-known Chinese newspapers “smartly shrugged out” of the proposal to publish the article, although it did not give an exact title.
Analysts warn: Cavanaugh divisive Republicans push out women voters on the eve of the interim period
Many high-level Republicans prefer to stand aside and defend the candidacy of Supreme Justice Brett Cavanaugh despite a number of allegations of sexual violence. Analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially from women, that may affect the upcoming mid-term elections.
Emotions about this situation have been exacerbating, and most of the Republicans have officially stated that they want to continue voting.
You can't go back to such things later, ” writes Grant Rier, Professor of Political Science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubtes whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute FBI investigation will be enough to calm the angered voters.
“The women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, and they will not forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn newspaper Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters scold "Nour Front" in front of the Senate, when the Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to nominate Cavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blacy Ford's testimony, reported to Mic.
“Democratism and motivation will go beyond the limit,” states a non-partisan politician, Stu Rotenberg, on the news site.
“People say the situation has already been bad enough, and it's true.
But things can get worse, especially in terms of female voters in the suburbs and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, though disliked the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford publicly testified against a candidate for the position of Chief Justice, blaming him for sexual harassment, the analysts assumed that if the Republicans confirmed the nomination, that action might give rise to a retaliatory response.
“This is already a mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, reports NBC News.
“It is not just about the vote in the committee or the final vote or whether Cavanaugh is on the bench, but how the Republicans deal with it as they do,” says Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that assists in electing the Democrats, the news channel.
Still, the Americans seem to be a bit divisive about who to believe, ford or Cavanaugh, and tend a little bit more to the latter.
New YouTube polls show that 41 percent of the respondents believe the Ford account, or are likely to believe it, while 35 percent say they believe Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Cavanaugh is likely to or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same thing about Ford.
At the insistence of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's charges, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramírez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Juridical Committee that Cavanaugh, in a state of intoxication, attacked her when she was 17.
Ramírez claims that the candidate for the position of Supreme Justice showed her his genitals at a party at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest design of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on an open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, it was a joke that the goal of Inrupt was to gain “world domination. ”
"We have to do it now," he says about his startup.
“This is a moment of history.”
The application uses the Solid technology, which allows people to build their own "personal online data warehouses" or POD.
It can include a list of contacts, files, as well as a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional data tools.
The application works in the same way as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all of which can be used in a single browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of a personal online data repository is that it is fully managed by the user, who can access any information needed.
The company refers to this principle as “individual empowerment through data”.
According to the CEO of John Bruce, the Inrupt idea is that the company has provided resources, processes and skills to make the Solid available to all.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of full-time developers contracted to work on the project, and a volunteer programmer community.
Beginning this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether or not his company should make major changes, which would make all of their business models all of a sudden.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In his post on Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by setting up a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee's voice has sounded pretty powerful in the debate about online neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee says.
Bernard Vann: Churchman awarded by the Victoria Cross during World War I
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one war priest was awarded Victoria's cross during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this award on September 29, 1918 for his involvement in the attack on Bellenglis and Løkur.
Sadly, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing he had received the highest British military award.
The memorial to this event was solemnly presented by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vanne, said that it was “very symbolical ” that the monument was discovered just 100 years after his grandpa got the award.
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vanne conducted his battalion through the St. Canten Canal “in a very dense mist and under the strong fire of gun and machine gun.
Later, he ran into the line of fire and “with the greatest courage” led the group forward, and then threw a field gun with one hand, shooting down three soldiers of the unit.
Lt. Colonel Vanne was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vanne, a 72-year-old grandson of the hero, said that "he would not have been able to do the same heroicly, but it is accommodating."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vanne, also laid a wreath at the end of the parade led by the Imperial Young Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Vanne said that “it is a great honour for him to take part in the parade” and added that “the worthiness of a true hero is backed up by the support that will be given by many people.”
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead, they showed Peppa the pig.
Imagine you didn't sleep all night to watch the full Bellator 206, but you didn't get to see the main event.
The table of San José contained 13 combats, including six major combat programs, and the fighting was aired live all night on Channel 5 of British Television.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, the British fans were stunning to see Peppa's Pig on screen.
Some fans were not impressed at all, as they didn't sleep until the morning just to watch the fights.
One of the Twitter fans called this a change in the show to a children's cartoon "some kind of sick joke."
“A state order was issued that for 6:00 a.m., this content was not appropriate, so they had to change to kids' programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President Bellator for Marketing and Communication, when he was asked why.
"Yes, Peppa Pig."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said that they planned to set up a schedule so that in the future, British viewers would also be able to watch.
“As far as re-showing is concerned, I think we can solve this,” says Coker.
"But it's Sunday, 6:00 a.m., and we can't solve this by Sunday, and it's gonna be Monday for them.
But we'll do our best.
Trust me, when the broadcast was changed, there was a lot of text messages, and all of them were far from friendly.
We were trying to solve this problem right away, and we thought it was some sort of technical failure.
Turns out, no, it was a matter of national importance.
I promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to cut the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans, we're trying to increase that number, but we're overreacting.
Yeah, it didn't work out well."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was incompetent because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic diver, Tom Daly, says he grew up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what got him to be successful.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't know that "not everyone like him" until he went to high school.
In his first program, Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that the win at the Olympics was less of a concern to him after he had a baby.
The permanent host of Kirsty Young's multi-year show took a leave of absence for months due to illness.
Daly, who was the main guest in Laverne's program, said he felt "smaller than any of his peers," because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and for girls.
He states: “To this day, these feelings of impoverishment and inadmissibility have been real, but they have given me strength, and I have been able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something" in order not to disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexual orientation.
The two-fold bronze Olympic Medalist has become a prominent LGBT player and, in his speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, has called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had expressed his opinion because he was lucky to be able to live an open life without consequences, and he wanted to give others hope.
A three-time world champion said that the feelings for a man, American director Dustin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013, "was taken by him by surprise."
Last year, Daly married an Oscar laureate, who is 20 years older than he is, but claims that the age difference was never a problem.
“If there is so much going on in your life at such a young age, ” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, “it is hard to find a peer who has the same radically opposing experience in life.
The couple became parents in June, and they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daly, and Daly said that "all his world view" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about "I need to win a gold medal," says the sportsman.
"But you know what, there are things more important than the golden Olympic medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
He said that his father didn't want to put up with his death, and one of his last requests was first-line tickets to London 2012.
"I couldn't say to him, "Daddy, you'll be out there, and you won't be able to sit in the front row," says Daley.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he actually stopped breathing, "I finally realized that he was not invincible," says the sportsman.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew this was what I've been dreaming about my whole life -- diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he says.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song, Proud by Heather Small, which helped him to prepare for the Olympics and still likes him so much.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11.15 p.m. in English summer time.
Michaelson, not in uniform, spent this Saturday Rider Cup on the bench.
American Phil Miquelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game of Ryder Cup, but he'll have to pull up the uniform to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
Michaelson, who played biennal for the record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Furic to the bench on Saturday for four balls and four.
Instead of being at the center of events, as has often been the case in the United States, a five - time major victor shared his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in the hope of fixing what he cares about.
Never with the most direct hit, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old sporter is not the ideal candidate for the hard track Le Golf National, where a long raft usually punishes for the wrong hits.
And if the course in itself is not quite frightening enough, Michaelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, will meet the exact British Open-Scope Champion, who has joined with the newest Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lose four points in the 12 singles make a big start, the Michaelson game can be decisive.
Ferrick expressed confidence in his partner, though he could say more.
“He fully understood the role assigned to him today, clapped me on the back, hugged me, and said he'd be ready tomorrow,” said Ferick.
"He's pretty confident, too.
He's a walking Hall of Fame, and he's done so much for these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there with all of us."
On Sunday, Michaelson will break Nick Foldo's record for the number of matches in the Ryder Cup.
This may mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has never met the height of his individual record.
Michaelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven no-ones, even though Feriq said his presence was a great asset to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to bully people, and he's a great guy who's interesting," he explained.
"I think the young players had fun with him this week, and it was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a big advantage can soon vanish.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, has learned from his experience that a significant single-size leadership in the Ryder Cup can easily turn in the wrong direction.
Denmark debuted in a 1997 game in Walderram, where a team led by Severiano Ballesteros had an advantage of five points over the Americans, but overcame the finish line just a bit ahead of the difference, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Walderram; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderram, where we won, but just so far," said Bjorn, who was in the picture, after watching the 2018 Class, wins on the "Le Golf National" field, with a score of 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, which led to a score of 10-6.
So history will prove to me and to the team that this is not over.
You'll have to make it up to you tomorrow.
Go do it right.
As long as the scoreboard is not on, it's not over.
We have a goal, and this is a chance to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I was not silent, focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we already know what we're up against -- the world's greatest players.
Satisfying the way his players performed on the unfavorable golf course, Bjorn added, "I would never have outdone myself in it.
There's another test ahead of us tomorrow.
There's an individual talk going on tomorrow, and that's a different thing.
It's always nice to be with a partner when things go well, but when you're left alone, you're testing all your strength as a professional golfer.
This is the idea that we need to inculcate in the player so that we can get to the top of the game tomorrow.
Now the partner stays behind, and he also has to do his best.
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Ferrick, believes that his individual players will be better off than with partners, except Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Ferrick himself has been a member of the winning team in Brooklyn in the last few days, before he was finally defeated when Europe held "The Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word about it," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united his players before the last day.
"We have 12 major matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get this over with, like, in Brooklyn, like Medina.
When the initiative is moving in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle of the game.
We've properly designed our plan for the game and set up the kids as we thought it was right, you know? Tomorrow we'll try to do a miracle."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the resistance by meeting Rory McElroy at the top of the table with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ayana Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the table.
“I have chosen this kind of group of guys, and in this order, because I think that this way, they will cover all possible shortcomings,” Bjorn said, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The commissioning of a new German warship has been rescheduled
The newest frigate of the German navy was due to be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War era, but this will not happen at least next year due to the failure of systems and the lavinic increase in value, reports the local media.
The entry into operation of the Rainland-Palatinate, the main ship of a completely new Baden-Württemberg class frigate, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit with a reference to a military representative.
The ship was due to join the navy in 2014, but the problems that had arisen since the shipment had made the fate of an ambitious project more difficult.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the navy in 2007 will be a replacement for the old Bremen class frigates.
As far as we know, they will have a powerful gun, a host of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some of the “steals” technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods, which should be able to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant postponement of entry means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, will be obsolete by the time they become operational, says Die Zeit.
The malignant frigate F125 hit the news headlines last year, when the German navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the ship's builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “programme and hardware defects” that made a warship useless when used in combat.
Inadequacies in the software were particularly critical, as the Baden-Württemberg class would be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers, only half of the workforce in the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was too heavy, reducing its productivity and limiting the ability of the Navy to implement future renovations.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" is believed to be twice as heavy as the vessels of the same class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the failure of the equipment, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the team, is also a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering Euro3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) over the original Euro2.2 billion.
The problems of anchoring the newest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of the recent warnings of Germany’s navy power reduction.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the navy was in fact “completing a stock of ships capable of deploying”.
The official said that the problem had become worse over time, because the old ships had been decommissioned, but they had not been assigned to replace them.
He visited that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates could ever be taken into service by the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study carried out in one of the Scotland Hills is designed to show how bats use the landscape to find food.
It was to be hoped that the data would provide a new look at the behaviour of unique winged mammals and help to further the conservation of the species.
A study organized by the National Foundation of Scotland will examine common netopics, soprano netopics, as well as brown long-haired bats and Dobanton Nights of Inverewe Garden, West Ross.
Special recorders will be set up at a number of locations around the site to track the actions of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile site surveys using hand-detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of yelling, as well as the activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
A map of the habitat will then be drawn up and a report will be prepared to give a detailed picture of their landscape-wide behaviour.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Nature Conservative, hopes that these results will show which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of habitat management, such as the formation of grasslands, as well as how to keep the forest in a state optimal for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and all over Britain has fallen significantly over the last century.
They are at risk of extinction due to the construction and development work that has an impact on their habitats and habitats.
Wind turbines and light systems can be dangerous, as well as adhesive fly tape, chemical processing of building materials, and hunting of pet cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They're using complex echo-location techniques to pinpoint the obstacles on the way.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important orchards and 76,000 hectare of land all over the country, is very serious about the population of bats.
The organization has 10 trained experts who carry out regular interviews, excursions, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has even created the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland at Threave Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of Scottish bats live.
The real estate manager, David Thompson, says the property is the perfect place for them.
"Here, in Threave, an excellent place for bats," he says.
"There are old buildings, a lot of old trees, and all the elements of a good environment.
But much about bats is unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need to live well.
It recalls the importance of testing the presence of bats before performing maintenance within private domains, as the deliberate destruction of a single nest can result in the death of up to 400 females and young persons, and perhaps even the destruction of the entire local population.
The bats are protected by law, their destruction, harassment or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Fless Foundation, is calling on the public to help.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how many of their individual species live."
Ronaldo denies the charges of rape, and his lawyers are gonna sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo denies the charges of rape against him, calling them “fee news,” and asserts that people simply “want to propiate, ” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newsmagazine Spiegel, who has published charges against a footballer.
Forward of Portugal and Juventusa was charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Majorga, who allegedly occurred in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, reported to the Spigel on Friday.
In an Instagram video, in which a football player has 142 million subscribers, a few hours after the charge was reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo called this information "feasible news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they've told us today -- all the fake news -- the five-time winner of Ballon d'Or on the camera.
"They just want to pry with my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's just part of their work.
I'm a happy man, and I'm doing great," he adds with a smile.
Ronaldo's attorneys are preparing to sue the Spigel for the charges they called “inadmissible information on suspicions of confidentiality”, according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Shertz stated that the player intended to claim compensation for “moral damage in an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the legal breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After he met at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in anal form, according to the documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on her lap and told her he was a "99% good guy, but one percent bad guy."
The records say that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was by mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police, and the hospital took pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an extra-judicial settlement, because she felt "a fear of getting back at her" and was afraid of "public humiliation."
A 34-year-old woman said she was now trying to change her place of residence, as she continued to experience the traumatic feelings of the incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid of Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer went to the Italian Giants of Juve in a deal of 100 million euro.
Brexit: Britain "rewards for the auto-producers lost forever"
The Minister of Business and Business, Greg Clark, said that the United Kingdom would “repent for it forever” if, after Brexit, it lost its status as a world leader in car production.
He also commented on information that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Bernaston plant, not far from Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clarke says.
The Japanese automaker stated that the effect of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit transaction could result in the loss of jobs.
The Bernaston plant produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain withdraws from the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be halted,” says Marvin Cook, manager of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about getting out of the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, states that it will shut down a Mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to automotive manufacturers, if there is no transaction in the Brexit supply chain, the risk will be high.
The Toyota production line is run “at the right time,” and the parts for customized cars are supplied by British and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If Britain withdraws from the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be a breakdown at the border, which, according to the industry, can result in delays and shortages of spares.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to keep the stock at its Derbyshire plant for more than one day, so the production will be halted.
Mr. Clarke said that Theresa May's plan, as outlined in Checkers, for future relations with the EU “is precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.
“We need a deal, and we want to make a better deal, which will not only make it possible, again, to succeed now, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he said on BBC Radio 4, “Today.
“Not just Toyota, but also other producers argue that we must be absolutely able to continue the successful supply chains.”
Toyota was not in a position to specify for what period of time the production would be halted, but in the longer term she warned that the extra cost would lower the company’s competitiveness and eventually result in a job cut.
Peter Tswallaris, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the factory's trade union, says, "In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we won't be able to get them back."
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed an accurate and secure plan for our future relationship with the EU”.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, according to the White House.
The responsible meeting between Donald Trump and the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, can be "rescheduled for another week", as the fight for Brett Cavanaugh's candidacy for the position of Chief Justice is continuing, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Müller, who is investigating Russia's intervention in the elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the potential obstacles to the President's justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney-General, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, in Washington for months has led to a lot of guesses.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of wire to record Trump and the possibility of impeaching the President by means of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein disproves this information.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, allegedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would have preferred not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed in order to avoid a confrontation with the senate court committee, where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blacey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI complaints against Cavanaugh, which further delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's Spokesman, Sarah Sanders, spoke at Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked to meet Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been set, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other developments in the Supreme Court.
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters have challenged this claim: Sanders has not been briefing the White House since 10 September.
Lead Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says that the lack of briefings is not due to the “discretion of the community” of TV reporters, although she added:“I will not deny that they play public. ”
She suggested an increase in the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The President is holding more meetings to answer the questions of the press than any other president before him,” she added, without, however, giving the exact figures:“We have these numbers. ”
Sanders assured me that the briefings would still take place, but “if the press has the ability to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.”
We're trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we've had in the last few weeks, and if you can talk to the President of the United States directly, it's a worthy substitute for press briefings.
Trump regularly answers questions from the White House, attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare for the conferences to be pressed alone.
The free, and at times strange, behavior of the president in front of the gathered journalists this week in New York may be the answer to why.
The Minister of Health writes to the EU in Scotland about the fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health has approached the EU staff working in the Scottish TOS to express his country ' s gratitude and wish to remain in office after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, MSP, sent this letter to the staff less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to defraying the cost of the status application for EU citizens in their public service.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman writes: “During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the issue of withdrawal continued, and the expected decision is due this fall.
But the British government is also making preparations for a possible no-transaction scenario.
I know this must be a very worrisome time for all of you.
It is, therefore, now that I want to stress once again how much I value the contribution of every staff member, irrespective of his or her nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie has been in an emergency operation for a head injury.
Michael Organe of Tennessee reported that the mid-back of Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, had suffered a head injury on Saturday after the 31–27 hit with the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Chief Trainer of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told the reporters that the injury was sustained shortly before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell down there," Reid said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie the oxygen on the sideline before putting it on a stretcher and taking it to a medical examination.
An official from Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details on the type/phase of the injury,” and in Tennessee, they are trying to find out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, who was just in his second year, it was the first season of Tennessee State to move from Illinois.
On Saturday, before getting out of the game, he successfully intercepted five balls, which was a total of 18 balls in the season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp fee to buy real property in the United Kingdom.
In line with Tori’s new plans, foreign buyers will be charged with a higher stamp on the purchase of real property in the United Kingdom, and the extra money they have made will be used to help the homeless.
This step will negate Corbin's attempts to attract young voters
An increased stamp levy will be charged to those who don't pay a tax in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects it to raise up to £120 million a year for the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher stamp to buy real property in the United Kingdom, and the extra money to be used to help the homeless will be announced by Teresa May today.
This step will negate Corbin ' s attempts to attract young voters, who promise to make housing more accessible and to increase the income of citizens.
An increase in the stamp levy will be imposed on non-tax-paying individuals and firms in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds so generated should stimulate the Government ' s efforts to assist the homeless.
An increase of up to 3 per cent to the existing stamp collection, including an increase introduced two years ago for the purchase of secondary and leased housing.
The Treasurer expects that this step will generate up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new London properties are not purchased by British residents, which has led to higher prices and made it more difficult for buyers who buy their first dwelling to improve their living conditions later.
Many of the country’s elite areas, especially in the capital, have become “ghosttowns” because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country buying a place.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp collection to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of squandering real property prices by buying land, but not actually using it, and he called on Mrs. May to give up the quota for affordable housing in order to correct the “famous housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms, which would include the control of rents and the cessation of unfair eviction.
He also wants to give the local government more authority to build new homes.
Mrs. May said, "I said last year I dedicated my premiere to the realization of the British dream — to make life a better place with every new generation.
This means, among other things, solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a life here.
It is not fair, however, that for people who are not British citizens, as well as for foreign companies, the acquisition of real property is as accessible as the hardworking British.
For too many people, the dream of acquiring a home has become too far off, and the threat to some of us to be on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to govern Scotland"
The manager of the Sunderland Club, Jack Ross, says that his "final goal" is to become a Scottish manager at a certain point.
A 42-year-old Scots is enjoying the renaissance of the North East Club, which is now ranked third in the first league, which separates from the top with three points.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a hat B, and that's it," Ross SportsOUND BBC Scotland said.
"But I grew up watching Scotland with my dad when I was a kid in the Hamptons, and it always attracted me back.
But this will be possible only if I can become a successful manager of the club.
Ross's predecessors, the Sunderland managers, also Dicka Avokaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Kanio.
The former manager, Alloa Athletic, said that he was not appalled by such prominent names in such major clubs, earlier rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, success at this point will depend on whether I can get this club back to the Premier League.
By its structure and capabilities, this club certainly belongs to the Premier League,” says the coach.
"It's not easy to get him out there, but I'll think I've done my job only if I can get the club back."
Ross only served as manager for three years, first as assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spent 15 months at Hearts' coaching headquarters.
He then helped Alloa up from level three, and in the next season he led St Mirren down to win the championship.
Ross states that he is more comfortable today than he has ever been in his game career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
"It's probably a real crossroads," he remembers his responsible work at Alloa.
"I truly believed that management fits me more than a game.
That sounds weird, 'cause I've done everything well, I've made a lot of money in this position, and I've made some progress.
But the game is more complicated.
There are a lot of things to do weekly.
I'm still under stress at work, but I feel good at running.
I've always wanted to run, and now, by doing this, I feel more comfortable as a fish in the water for the rest of my adult life.
You can listen to a full interview on SportsOUND on Sunday, September 30, on Scotland's radio from 12:00 to 13:00 in English summer time.
According to the poll, 5:30 is the perfect time for a pint of beer.
The heat of the summer has led to an increase in the sale of British pubs, but has lowered the sale of restaurants online.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consulting Company, who has received this statistic, says: "Long-term solar activity, as well as the longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup, means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when the sale in the pubs rose by 2.8 per cent and in the restaurants, on the other hand, fell significantly.
The June fall in income in the restaurant trade by 1.8% also continued in July.
Drinking pubs and bars have shown much better results in restaurants.
Pubs that only sell food have also been hit by the heat of the sun, though not as much as restaurants.
Seems like people just want to go outside to get a cup.
The sale of drinks in pubs and bars rose by 6.6% in a month, and the food rose by 3%.
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in the leisure and hotel business, says, "These results have continued the trend we have been seeing since late April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events continue to be critical when it comes to sales on the non-profit market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant nets continue to experience difficulties, especially since a 4.8 per cent annual decline in sales will be particularly painful due to continued price pressures.
A long hot summer has turned out more than ever to be for food operators, and it is not yet a fact that August, by bringing more temperate temperatures, will give much needed rest.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including those re-opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowing down of brands.
Monitoring the industrial sales of the Coffer Peach Tracker for the British pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyses the productivity data of 47 networks with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion and is a recognized industry standard.
One out of every five kids has a secret social media account he's hiding from his parents.
According to the survey, one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they conceal from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an upsurge in the page of the “feek insto”
This news has increased the fear of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a "primary" account that their parents know about.
But one out of every five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, is creating social media accounts that they keep from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of online “instos” accounts, i.e., the Instagram, a picture-sharing site.
This news has increased concerns about sexual content publications.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a basic, clean account, which their parents had access to, but also secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally had access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, stumbled on a teenager who called on others to "rape him."
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Managers (HMC) found that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two social media profiles, half of whom admitted that one of them was generally secret.
Head of HMC Mike Buchanan says, "Many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that are not available to their parents and teachers, and this is an alarming fact."
Aileed Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" of Scotland's light athletics.
At the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body, Aileed Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of the Scottish Light Athletics as an observer member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most renowned athletic athlete, and Ian Beatty says that this is an excellent opportunity for sporters to benefit from the vast experience of athletics at the international level over the past decade.
“Aylid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global light athletic community, and we are confident that her participation will be of great benefit to athletics in Scotland,” states Beatty.
Doyle says, "I want to be the voice of athletics, and I hope I can make a good contribution and promote sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, has a total of four golden Olympic medals, and now works as a private commentator for BBC, and after a stroke, he has lost his ability to walk.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I've lost my ability to move.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I was gonna get better, and if so, to what extent.
It was a debilitating job, but I've completely recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing a skillful exercise!
Thank you so much for your support!"
Advertisements of a breast-sucker, in which a breast-feeding mom was compared to a cow, shared the views of Internet users
The breast-sucking company has raised disputes on the Internet by publishing an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers to cash-cows.
By putting on the market, they say, “the world's first silent breast-sucker,” Elvie's consumer technology company has published an advert music video showing the freedom that the new breast-sucker gives to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real moms dance in full hay under a music track, saying, "Yes, I'm feeding my own milk, but you won't see my tail" and "if you don't see it, it's not owl, it's my breast."
And the choir goes, "Healing, healing, we feed our babies with breast milk, we heal, we heal."
This commercial, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has led to controversy on the Internet.
77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments: The video has received a mixed response from the audience, with many saying it sheds light on the dairy industry’s “wraths. ”
"Very bad decision to use cows to sell this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to make milk, except that their children are taken from them within a few days of being born,” writes one user.
Elvie's milk sucker dresses directly under a special bra (Elvie/Moother)
And another comment is, "I know it's just as traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why don't you use it to sell a milk sausage for mothers who keep their children? "
Another user adds: “advertisements detached from reality”.
Others, on the other hand, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was "just brilliant."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was feeding the baby, I'd definitely get one.
Breast-feeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertising, of course, is a bit crazy, but it kind of feels like it.
A brilliant product," wrote one user.
And another comment: "A cool ad for moms who breast-feed (often do it right in their work or in the toilets) and who do feel a little "cow."
This ad is not to praise or scold our dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all danced with these invisible suckers hidden under their brass.
The concept of this campaign is based on the fact that many breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie's milk sucker is completely inexpensive, has no wires or tubes, is freely placed in a breast-feeding bra, and is not visible, giving women the opportunity to move, keep their babies, or even go out on the street while they are feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner in early childhood development at Mother, comments: “Elvie is a so revolutionary product that it deserves a brave and provocative ad.
Taking a parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast-feeding and all its problems, in a funny and fun way, to show the incredible sense of freedom that the new sucker gives us.
This isn't the first time Elvie's milk sucker hits the headlines.
During London's fashion week, the mother of two children appeared on the runway of the designer Martha Yakubowski, using this product for use.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly cross-borders has remained relatively constant, in part because the strict rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children in the caretakers.
Most of the sponsors are usually the same undocumented immigrants themselves and are afraid to put their stay in the country at risk by vouching for a child.
The risk rose in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential bailiffs and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints, and that the data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for bail for minors without care.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had not been tried before.
“Around 80 per cent of persons who are either bailors or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are foreign offenders.
We are therefore continuing to persecute these individuals,” Albens said.
In an effort to speed up the process of enrolling children, the authorities have introduced new rules that require some of them to be tried within a month of their detention, rather than 60 days, as they used to be.
In order to declare their legal status to the Immigration Judge, many are present via video link, not in person.
Those who are considered to be ineligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to the shelter workers and the information that has emerged in the system in recent months, the longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which may result in an outbreak of violence or escape.
Lawyers say that these problems are on the rise in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child having difficulty are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to camp camps without giving them time to prepare for it emotionally or to say good-bye to their friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria commands the US, France, and Turkey's “Occupational Forces” to withdraw immediately.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the fact that the country has been in war for eight years.
Mualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces had been on Syrian land illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “will be considered accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and without conditions,” he said to the assembly.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been driven out of their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this holy battle until we cleanse all the Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 military personnel in Syria, who are mainly training and advising both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
With regard to the refugees, Mu'alem said that good conditions had been created for their return, and he accused “some Western countries” of “proliferating irrational fears” that had prompted the refugees to stay outside the country.
“We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens,” he says.
“They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warn that no reconstruction assistance will be provided to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations Diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major siege of the rebels, Idlib, created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Mu'alem stressed that the agreement had a “determined time-frame” and expressed the hope that the military action would target jihadists, including militants from the Al-Qaida-affiliated Nusr Front, who would be “destroyed”.
UN Minister Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the Government and the Opposition, will be convened in the near future in order to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee, stating that the work of the commission should be restricted to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and cautioned against intervention.
Why Trump wins a second term
In keeping with this logic, Mr. Trump will win his re-election in 2020 if the impeachment and the scandal do not end his presidency prematurely, which is perhaps the hope of many liberal viewers.
And this will no doubt be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency in history!"
At the moment, there's no sign of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million per CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers of prime time, as compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Madow Show" has outperformed the ratings of cable channels, gathering 3.5 million viewers at night during the main news show.
“This is the fire to which people are drawn, because it's beyond our comprehension,” says Neil Bere, a director of the ABC drama, the Designated Survivor, about a member of the Cabinet who becomes president after the Capitol has been destroyed by the attack.
Nell Scowell, a long-public comedy writer and author of "Just Funny: Some Distinguished Truths About Infiltration of the Hollywood Boys' Club" suggests a different theory.
She remembers driving a cab to Boston once before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he's funny!" she said.
In all this chaos, there's something of value -- it's fun.
Of course, because, unlike the rest of the content on TV, Washington newslines can determine the future of "Roe vs. Wade" and answer questions about the possibility of reuniting immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you've been watching a group of experts for six hours in a row, talking about Bob Woodward's use of a "deep background" for his book, or about Paul Manaforth's $15,000 stratoskin jacket (a dress warmed up with pride), as The Washington Post writes, or about the dramatic description of Stormy Daniels, say, Mr. Trump's anatomy, it's out of the ordinary.
I, for instance, will never look at Super Mario with the same eyes.
“Perfectly, his job is to make us feel that the reality show is that he feeds you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, the executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the creator of the Pawn Stars about the changing cast of the Trump show and the daily twists of the story.
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you're hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleis this week, on the north bank of Kauai, there was 27 degrees of heat, the sun was bright, but he hid inside his house and watched MSNBC during CNN.
He couldn't get off the screen, at least not when they show Brett Cavanaugh's appearance before the Senate Juridical Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is being decided.
"I remember when we were doing all this crazy show, "it's the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flace says.
"Then I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outsider money is infiltrated in the hardest mid-term elections run by the White House.
Not surprisingly, the 17th district of Pennsylvania is receiving a cash flow from a change in districts in Congress, where two officials are in a race for the same place.
This suburb of Pittsburgh, whose geography has not been changed so long ago, supports a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb is opposed to another active official, the Republican of Kit Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is very much intertwined with the new 17th.
The charts were reviewed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January ruled that, as a result of the electoral frauds, the old districts had been attributed to the Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a heated debate on the financing of campaigns between the main party's financial forces, the Congressional Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
The name Lamb came to be known in Pennsylvania after winning a small difference in the March special Congressional elections in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give the Democrats a small advantage.
The US punished El Salvador for supporting China, but then retreated
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already accepted Beijing, which had led to a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, who also owned Panama until his partners evicted the Trump Management Team.
Representatives of the Department of State decided to withdraw the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “the recent decisions to deny Taiwan's recognition”, which was announced earlier this month by the Spokesman of the Department of Heather Nauert.
But it was only for El Salvador, which received about $140 million of American aid in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the country of Central America, with its high rate of unemployment and murder.
Against the background of regular internal meetings, the representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to be held to take stock of a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in the prevention of migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, high-level officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, and had in fact put an end to the issue of El Salvador ' s punishment.
According to the diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October and will be addressed by Vice-President Mike Pence to show that the Administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
The three American diplomatic representatives have returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House representative, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate that had been shared by three American officials, including two diplomats, who had agreed to discuss internal issues on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports have also been confirmed by an external analyst who is part of the administration, but who also spoke on anonymous terms.

The next step could be to report to Special Adviser Robert Müller on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump ' s justice, which was now very significant in public records.
Mr. Müller has also reportedly begun to investigate the existence of Trump's collusion with Russia and its attacks in the past elections.
If Congress replaces the host, Mr. Trump will face the responsibility of this body, just as he prepares to address the voters again, and perhaps eventually to the jury of his colleagues.
But there's a lot of ifs; I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup d ' état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted and backed the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
But we have not done so, and we have missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of bloodshed.
The course of history is taking place at such points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are going through some of these critical moments now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to this newspaper, last year he offered to make a covert record of the President ' s activities and reasoned that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein contends that The Times data are wrong.
“How will we react if the recent FBI-requested investigation of Brett Cavanaugh is not complete or true, or if he is still admitted to the position of Supreme Justice, despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false statements?
And above all, will we, in the medium term, vote for the Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these trials with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe we can go through it with dignity, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was banished to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, whose officials once occupied a Polish home in which I lived years later.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic in the run-up to a match with a football club, the Vienna Rapid.
The Rangers accept the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after an impressive tie in Spain over the Villarreal earlier this month, will enable them to take a strong position in the League of Europe Group G.
The knee injury prevented the semi-defendant Graham Dorrans from performing for the first time in the season with a 2:2 count against the Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a springboard to achieve a lot of results.
"This was a good moment for us, because "Villarreal" is a good team," said a 31-year-old footballer.
"We entered the game, thinking we could get something, but we left with no one.
We may have been able to deal with it in the end, but in general, it was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success was at the second half, where we were better.
This Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's gonna be a hard game, because they've shown a good result in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, with everything that's been going on with my injuries, and the replacements at the club itself, but now there's a good thing in this place.
The composition is excellent, and the kids are really enjoying it; they've been trained for the "ura."
I hope we can move forward, leave behind last season and succeed.
Women are falling asleep for fear of their pension savings.
Although the interviewees had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the national study said that they discussed with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
But only 10% said they talked to their kids about it.
“People want to be taken care of by a family member, but they don't try to talk to them about it,” says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwide Life Insurance.
And that's how we start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family, where and how you will receive medical care, as this may be an important cost factor.
Consult with your financial consultant to help you draw up a plan to pay for these expenses.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people have been killed as a result of the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
Due to the failure of communications, rescuers are not able to get any information from Donggal, an area to the north of Pale, which is near the epicentre of an earthquake with a force of 7,5.
In Palau, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of a natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palau and Donggal on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 (data for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami erupted.
Donggala is a district stretching along 300 km (180 km) of the coastline in the north-west of Sulawesi Island.
The county, which is less than the province, had a total population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are at the heart of the economy of Central Sulawesi, in particular the Donggal coastal region.
Nickel is also important to the economy of the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morival, on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, the last 100 years of the tsunami have witnessed several destructions in Palau and Donggal.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggal.
The tsunami also took place in western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Vulcan Fire Ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the western coast of Aceh, in North Sumatra, on 26 December, caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A sequence of massive earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 hit the south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 occurred in the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-point earthquake occurred on one of the Mentawai Islands in Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: The fragile earthquake hit the district of Pidi Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and the tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but over 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists temporarily stayed in ruins.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is under arrest for domestic violence.
Trak Palin, the eldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and the vice-president of Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, in an intervention in a situation of domestic violence, and for resisting the arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the State Police of Alaska.

He is also charged with a class B crime, punishable by up to one day ' s imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police, reporting the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report on domestic violence and possession of a gun in a state of drunkenness in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 after explaining her son's brutal behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people died in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-point earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are incidental videos on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu, when the tsunami hit the shore.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office wants to hand over a rare death sentence to a suspect in a New York attack.
The New York Federal Prosecutor's Office is seeking the death penalty for Syfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare penalty for a federal crime that has not been used in the state since 1953.
In October, Saïpov, 30, allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to attack a cycle track on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that the Saïves “deliberately” killed eight people and “deliberately” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to commit the death penalty in the South District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges may be subject to the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the grand federal jury read out a conviction against Saïp with 22 counts of murder, which included eight counts of racketeering, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutors, the attack was “deliberately planned and premeditated”, the Saïp carried out it, as described, “in a repulsive, brutal and criminal way”.
“Sifullo Habibullahevich Saïp has caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Henrique Angelini, Nicholas Cléves, Anne-Lore Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damiana Pugnukko,” states in the letter of intent.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the prosecutor in the Southern District of New York demanded the death penalty for a criminal offence.
In September 2009, the accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted for the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The death penalty in a federal case in New York was last imposed in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed for collusion to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed using an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the Saipov judicial documents, an Uzbek national showed no remorse after his attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saïpov told the authorities that he had been inspired by a video of ISIL on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital ward, and told the police.
He denies his guilt on all 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s federal public defenders, said that they were “apparently disillusioned” by the decision of the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
“We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty, not life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only add to the pain of the events for all of them,” said Patton.
The defence of Saipov has previously made a request to the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Member of Parliament for Tori says that NYJEL FARAGE should not be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Today, during the protest at the Tori conference, Nigel Faraj vowed to “mobilize the people's army”.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians needed to “feel” euro skeptics, as a member of Parliament, Theresa May, suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bone, said at a meeting in Birmingham, that Britain would have "should" if Mr. Farage was a secretary to Brexit.
However, the problem that Mrs. May faces in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks is also compounded by the fact that members of the Tory Party who are opposing the EU are joining in a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The Premier is working hard to keep his compromise plan, as expressed in Checkers in the midst of the attack by Brexit, his opponents, and the EU.
The allies insist on her continuing to try to make a deal with Brussels, despite a negative reaction, and thus to force Euroskeptics and Laborists to choose between her packet and the Chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihall, he wanted to play Checkers.
He proposed that Mr. Faraj be levelled and held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“Had he been responsible, we would have been out,” he said.
Member Wellingborough added, "I will continue to stand for Brexit, but we need to win Checkers."
Addressing the EU, he said, "We didn't go to war in world wars to be dependent.
We want to lay down our laws in our country.
Mr. Bone rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay is completely untrue.
Brexit supporter of the Tori Party, Andrea Jenkins, was also at a meeting, saying to the press, "I say, Prime Minister, just listen to the people."
“Checkers is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is also not popular among the members of our party and our activists, who are actually storming the streets and elect us first.
Please put it down to Checkers and begin to listen to what you are told.
In her strong address to Mrs. May, she added: “The Prime Minister will remain in office if they keep their promises.”
Mr. Faraj said that if politicians were to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referenda, they should be made to “fear up. ”
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he says.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We're not gonna let you get away with it."
Referring to the enthralled crowd, he added, "I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brixit's betrayal, to feel at once.
“We will mobilize the people's army of this country, which has given us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
In the meantime, Brexit's opponents took a demonstration on Birmingham, and then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
A number of activists waved "Tori vs. Brexit" this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, criticized the conservatives for the security problems in their party's mobile attachment.
“And these people claim to be able to set up the IT systems and technologies of Canada, to work at borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"It's one complete farce.
There is no good Brexit in principle," he states.
Warren's planning to “study up” the opportunity to participate in the presidential race.
Senator Elizabeth Warren, a member of the U.S. Parliament, says that after the November elections, she will “studyly explore the possibility of running for presidents.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a meeting in the West Massachusetts City Hall on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Deel, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There's talk about her having a chance to take up Trump's post in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon in Holioca, she held another meeting with the voters; since Trump took up office, it has been her 36th meeting with the voters in the City Hall.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for "the women to go to Washington to "repare" our broken government, and for that to happen, there's a woman up there."
As a result of Simms' murder, an LSU player was arrested.
The Baton-Rage Police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the LSU-Basketballman's murder, Wade Simms, on Friday, was arrested.
At 11:00 p.m. in English time, at a press conference, the Baton-Roose Police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the Police Department released a video of the shooting, asking for an I.D. of the person who was able to be shot on the video.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot at South University campus on Friday morning.
"Wade Simms was shot in the head, and he died on a Saturday, "and the Chief of Police, Murphy J. Paul, said to the press.
Wade stood up for his friend, and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being involved in the incident, carrying a gun, and shot Wade Simms.
When he was arrested, Simpson resisted and was taken into custody at the East Baton County Police Department.

Grand Priss of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the title of world champion after command tactic has given him the victory over Sebastian Fettel.
From the moment that Waltery Bottas was qualified on Saturday, overstepping Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that the Mercedes command tactic would play a major role in the race.
Already with the Pole-Position Bottas, he's got a good start and he's practically hanging out on Hamilton when he was defending his position at the first two corners, and he's invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel was the first to go to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton swirling in the tail of the group – a choice that became decisive.
The Mercedes went off to a pit-stop one lap later, and he left behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after a bit of a wheel-in-the-wheel struggle, sprung up ahead, putting Ferrari’s driver in an unwilling position to leave the inner space free, risking getting caught up after a double-move to protect at the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstoppen began from the back row of the net and was in seventh place by the end of the first round.
He then ran most of the race, sticking on his own tires, with the aim of fast finishing, moving Kimi Rykkonen to fourth place.
In the end, he went to the pit stop on the 44th round, but he was not able to increase the rate in the remaining eight circles, as Rykkonen was ranked fourth.
It's been a hard day, because Valttery has done a fantastic job this weekend and has shown real nobility by sharing it with me.
The team has done such an extraordinary job to have a couple of tricks in stock," said Hamilton.
Traitory sign language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting with the voters on Saturday for her claim that she had not made public a letter from Christina Blacey Ford, who accused Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the position of Chief Justice, of sexual harassment.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford's statement to the Senate Juridical Committee, saying that what was going on in the Senate had shown that the participants in the events were “smug, vile, and deceitful.
“The only possible response to all this, and what has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, is beautiful, it's anger, anger, abomination, and lies,” he said.
"You see all the leaks, and then they say, "No, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you "send" information?
Do you remember her answer... you "did" the information of the document? - "what, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spill.
Okay, stop.
Did we say "silent"?... No, we didn't "silent," he added with the senator's intonation.
In July, a letter detailing the charges against Cavanaugh was sent to Feinstein, and in early September it was illegally made public, but Feinstein denies that the leak occurred in her office.
“I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, but I didn't leak her information,” Feinstein said to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked."
However, the manner in which she denied the charges of the leak seemed to dislike the president, who commented on it during the Saturday rallies, "I'll tell you what, the body language really let her down.
She may not have been "silent," but the body language was the worst I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend his candidacy for the position of Supreme Justice, who was accused by three women of sexual harassment, the President suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
“They are certainly trying to regain power in all possible ways.
We see vileness, abhorrentness, they don't care who they're gonna hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control,” quotes Mediaite.

In the Elite Hockey League game, Dundee Stars paid for a Friday's defeat against Belfast Giants, winning a return match on Saturday with a score of 5-3 in favor of Dundee.
The "Jayants" won an early two-point advantage thanks to the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney raised the level of the home team before Dwyer led the "Jayants".
Francois Bouchard summed up the Dundee account before the two hollows of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
For the people of Adam Keef, who won the 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, it was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
This was the fourth time in the season, when the Giants won the three previous match.

The air controller was killed so that hundreds of people on the plane could escape the earthquake.
The Indonesian air traffic controller was postmortem ranked a hero after he was deliberately killed to enable a plane with hundreds of passengers to fly safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many left unaccounted for in a massive earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday, which caused the tsunami.
Heavy subterranean tremors continue to demolish the area, and many people in the city of Palu find themselves under the rubble of the buildings.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the horrendous swinging tower at Muthiara Sice Al Juffrey Airport, Palu City.
He stayed in his seat to make sure that the Batik Air Light 6321, which was on the airstrip at the time, was able to fly safely.
Then, when he thought the tower was falling, he jumped off it.
He later died in the hospital.
An Indonesian aeronautical representative, Johannes Sirait, stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the controller died before the helicopter was able to land in Pala.
"We are very sorry for this loss," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of people killed by the earthquake can reach thousands, as the disaster management agency has reported that access to the towns of Donggal, Sigi and Butong is restricted.
“The number of victims is likely to grow, as a large number of people are still under the rubble, and many have not been able to get out of it,” says a representative of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters have devastated the city of Pala, where a mass grave of the dead will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Rhysa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News: "The ambulance brings the victims every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The mini-markets are all over the place.
Jan Gelfund, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, says CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is already in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're gonna catch.
Tragedy has already taken on a rather serious scale, but it can be much worse.
The President of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, arrived in Palau on Sunday and spoke to the armed forces of the country, inter alia, saying, "I ask you all to work day and night in order to carry out all the evac-related tasks.
Are you ready? ", says CNN.
Early this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lomboca, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports a missing person after a plane crash in a lagoon.
The airline that was carrying out the flight that was hit by the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports that one person has been missing, while it has been said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew have left the sinking plane safely.
Air Niugini states that on Saturday afternoon, she has no information about a single male passenger.
The airline stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and the police to try to find the man.
The airline was not able to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local seafarers helped save other passengers and a crew of the plane after it fell on the water, trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that on Saturday, six passengers had been hospitalized, all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The U.S. Airlines and Airlines claim that the plane landed in a lagoon near the airstrip.
Some witnesses claim that the plane was unable to land on the runway.
The American passenger Bill Janes says the plane has begun to enter the runway too low.
"And it's very good," Janes adds.
Janes told us that he and other passengers were able to get to the emergency exits on a sinking plane, as the water level was up to the waist.
He also said that the stewardess panicked and yelled on board, and that he was slightly injured in the head.
The U.S. Navy reports that seafarers who renovated the dock in the vicinity also helped to save themselves by using an inflatable boat to bring people to shore before the plane was loaded down by about 30 meters (100 feet).
Air Safety Network data show that over the past two decades 111 people have been killed in plane crashes of companies registered with PNG, but none of them have been related to Air Niugini.
The Intel Analyst has been able to prove the burning of a woman alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution brought a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi in 2014.
A U.S. Department of Justice analyst, Paul Rollett, testified for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the Department how he used his cell phone records to get an overview of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Roulette said that he had got the location of these people from a number of mobile phones; according to this data, Tellis was spending time with Chambers that night, which is in contradiction to his previous testimony, reports The Clary Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the data, his mobile phone was in the vicinity of Chambers; when it was found, the police interrogated Sanford.
In his statement, Sanford said he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that "it was a lie, because my truck was in Nashville."
The other incompatibility was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before her death.
The phone records, however, indicated that they had been called for only one week.
Rollett also showed that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis, her text messages, phone calls, and contact information had been removed from her phone.
"He erased it from his life," says Hale.
The defence must begin to present its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later the same day.

Another black one?!
The New York nanny sued the couple for a racist text.
The New York nanny sued a couple for discriminating dismissal after having received a message from a woman complaining that the nanny was another black one, which the woman mistakenly sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
Spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that the claim is “for the purpose of extorting”.
Lyncy Plasco-Flexman, the mother of the two children, expressed her concern that the new nanny offered by the Childcare Service, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to her family on her first day of work in 2016.
"No, it's not another black one," Mrs. Plasco-Flexman texted her husband.
But instead of texting her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice wrong.
Cognizant of her error, the “small-infected” Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, claiming in the service that the nanny who turned out to be an African-American was not doing her job well, and in general, they were expecting a Filipino, not an African-American, report the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day of work, and then sent home to Uber.
Maurice now sues for a couple and seeks compensation for the dismissal of $350 a day for six months, under the terms of the original oral agreement, which, however, was not established by any contract.
"I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable," she said, "Post" on Friday, adding, "and I know it's discrimination."
Spouses disagree with the charge of racism, and claim that the dismissal of Maurice can be considered a reasonable step, since by resenting her, they would no longer be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her in a message that she didn't really mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said Joe Plasco, the Post.
"But would you trust your children with someone you've been rude to, even if you've been rude, not wanting to?
Would you trust your new baby?
Come on!'
Calling the claim “forgery”, Plasco said that his wife had a baby just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Are you ready to follow a man in this position?
Not very sweet of you," added a banker who specializes in investment.
The trial is still under way, but public opinion has already handed down a sentence on social media, blaming the couple for unacceptable behaviour and logic.
The Paddington publishers feared the readers would not understand the move with the talking bear, says in a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, remarked on the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the position of the first person to read the work, even before it was published.
It's very funny to know that Paddington has a huge success."
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a children's book about a bear, was an operator at BBC, and would have taken the rejection of the publication with optimism, and she added that the 60-year-old anniversary of the publication of his books was “and cheerful and bitter” as the author was no longer present last year.
As for the Paddington bear itself, she speaks of him as “a very important member of our family,” and that her father was quietly proud of the fact that his character was finally known.
"He was a quiet and humble man," his daughter says.
"For Paddington was so real to him, and for the father, it was almost as if his own child had made progress: he was proud of him, though he didn't really think it was his own merit.
I think that's how he viewed Paddington's success.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always gave credit to the bear itself.
I had to say good-bye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was taken to the Hospital of Nice Hospital, Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“It was a regular phone call and it was a real bad thing that something went wrong,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperuza says.
"Then he called again and said that she was gonna die in the next two minutes, and that we should say good-bye.
I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The meds that the doctors gave her, making her heart work, gradually stopped working, leaving her body.
She died earlier than expected.
I should have just sat there and waited, knowing it was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry, or yell, or cry, because there were other people around me, other families.
I've had to hold myself together."
After all, Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa, grieving for the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, humbling herself with the immense loss she just had to endure.
“No one around knew what had happened,” she says.
"My head fell down, I didn't stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this all-encompassing empathy for Nadu.
He so needed my love and support.
I know how much he loved her."

"I don't want other parents to feel the same way I do every day," she says.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Leedney, says her son was a great cook and he had a hell of a pretty smile.
"Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, it was like a light was on in the room.
But before he died, he left his job because he was going through a really terrible time.
This happened in 2014, and Tyler was found dead by his brother, who was 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, "I don't stop fearing a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis made up these postcards “to make people know there's someone to talk to and talk to, even if it's your friend.
You can't sit and keep quiet, you have to talk to people."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, has lost her husband, Mark, who has been with her for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he was depressed, upset or anything," she says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas, he was particularly sick: he didn't even look at the kids when they opened their presents.
She says that his death was a massive trauma to them, but they have to go through it, and this event has shaken our family.
It tore her apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.

Brett Cavanaugh's future is on the line: the FBI is in the middle of an investigation.
“I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for, a time-limited investigation, we could bring a little bit of unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was “breaking up” against the background of a growing party chain reaction.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Time is the cause of their hesitation.
Intermediate elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as is expected, it will go bad for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to and elect him as the highest judge of the country.
George W. Bush is calling the senators to lobby for Mr. Cavanaugh's support, who has been working in the White House for Mr. Bush since his time, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife, Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's gonna happen after the FBI release its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It was still not clear whether Mr. Cavanaugh would be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pence to address the issue of equality of votes and to confirm his candidacy for the position of Supreme Judge.
The number of defectors from North Korea has fallen under Kim
Since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has fallen, the South Korean legislator has said.
Park Byung Seug, referring to the data from the Southern Ministry, stated that, compared to the 2,706 escapes recorded in 2011, the figure had fallen to 1,127 last year.
Mr. Park said that the key factors had been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates imposed by smugglers.
Pyongyang has no public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that, since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people run through China, with the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a secure demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China viewed defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often subjected them to forced repatriation.
North-south relations, which are still in a state of war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume the stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This occurred after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, at which they reached common agreements on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yoon Ho accused the US of hindering progress on this issue with its sanctions.
“Unless we have the least confidence in the US, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will in no way be able to start disarmament unilaterally,” Mr. Ri stated in his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical," and claims he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the position of Supreme Justice, “hysterical” and said that he was, because of her temper, unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at a Texas Tribune Festival event in Austin, Texas.
“I can't help but think that if a woman ever let herself be like this, she would have been called a "stress," says Pelosi about her reaction to Cavanaugh's statement to the Senate Juridical Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blacie Ford's allegations of sexual harassment, which allegedly occurred when both of them were still teenagers.
Cavanaugh spoke emotionally, even suffocated and suffocated at times, talking about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally denounced the committee’s Democrats, calling the charges against him a “smart and well-planned assassination of the active man,” organized by the liberals, angered by the fact that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Cavanaugh ' s testimony had only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think he's disqualifying himself with his claims, as well as the way he's attacking the Clintons and the Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi resented when asked if she would try to bring Cavanaugh to justice if his guilt was confirmed, and if the Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say, "if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not just for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he's at," said Pelosi.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions with regard to the Affordable Health Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a representative of the conservative justice system.
At the hearing on his candidacy, Cavanaugh was not satisfied with the question of whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court ' s decisions.
“Now is not the time to let a hysterical and preconceived man take up the position of Supreme Judge, and say, "How brilliant!", Pelosi says.
And women have to own it.
It's just anger, months and years of anger, she can't go through it without tears.
"When we're mad, we're crying," Miss Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's as unusual as you think it is?"
She went on to say, "I've been very helpful to a woman who's been working in a senior position somewhere, and she told me she was crying when she was mad, but she developed a technique that she used to tell her interviewer, "You might think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm really mad."
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed with this approach.
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger, in part, because they are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in an office dominated by men: one day I wept out of anger, but I was caught by an old woman, a soulless manager, who I was always horribly afraid of, and dragged to a stairwell.
"Never let them see you crying," she told me.
“They don't know you're crying out of anger.
They think you're upset, and they're happy to think you've finally made you mad."
Patricia Schrader, then a Democrat Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some casual affair and left the race, Mrs. Schrader, deeply disillusioned, decided that there was no reason why she could not run for the presidency.
“This decision was not well thought out,” she admitted to me with a smile 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates were already in the race, and the last thing they needed was another.
Some called the case "White Snow and Seven Dwarves."
The campaign was about to come to an end, lagging behind in the fund-raiser, so it vowed not to take part in the race if it didn't raise $2 million.
It seemed to be a complete loser.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave her $1,000 to men, offered her only 250.
“What am I to them, a priced item, or what?”, she wondered.
When she made her speech, declaring that she would not run an official campaign, she was so emotionally overwhelmed by the gratitude of the people who supported her, the frustration of the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and access to the voters, and the anger of gender-based discrimination that she suffocated.
"You'd think I'd have a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schrader recalls how the press reacted to her.
"You might think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still wondering, what would they write on my monument?
"She's been crying for a while?"
How a trade war with America can be of benefit to Beijing
The experts believe that the first spikes of the US-China trade war have been stunning, and, while the battle is far from over, the split between countries can benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made the first warning earlier this year, taxing the main Chinese export products, including solar, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, when new tariffs had an impact on products worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), in fact taxing half of all goods from China to the US.
Beijing has been putting an equivalent backlash every time, recently putting $60 billion in taxes on United States goods at between five and ten per cent.
China has promised that the response to the US will be equal every time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to begin to face at least the slightest difficulty in the near future.
Making Washington stand back means giving up the demands, but publicly giving up the US would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
But, according to experts, if Beijing can play its cards right, the US trade war pressure can provide long-term support to China by reducing the interdependencies of the two economies.
“The fact that a prompt political decision in Washington or Beijing can create an environment that will lead to an economic corking in any of these countries is in fact far more dangerous than previously acknowledged by the observers,” says Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security, which specializes in Asia.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “prepared” for the return of the refugees
Syria was ready for the voluntary return of the refugees and was seeking help in the reconstruction of a country that had been devastated by a war that had lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem said that the country was improving.
“The situation on the ground today has become more stable and secure thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The Government has continued to rebuild the areas that have been demolished by terrorists so that people can live there in peace.
At present, all conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they have been forced to leave because of the terrorist attacks and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for the help to rebuild a destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance on any terms or from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe anchors the victory at the Rider Cup in Paris
The European team won the Rider Cup 2018, winning the US team with a total of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The US has been losing on European land six times in a row, and the European Ryder Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe has regained the crown thanks to the team of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who scored the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Miquelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, hit his first long-distance punch in the water on the 16th hole of a pair of three, succumbing to his match, Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds, becoming the 1-4 player who ever went 5-0-0, as the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit was defeated by a 5:4 player with the lowest rating in the European team, Turbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
One of the world's best players, Dustin Johnson, gave up 2:1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have been in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
The Spaniard of Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, was the winner of the tournament in the history of Europe with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help today.
It's been a hard year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the cup again.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help," says emotionally, Garcia after a European victory.
He's handing the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who won the American golf legend by Tiger Woods on Sunday with a count of 2:1 in a single game.
“I am incredibly proud of this victory — I grew up watching Tiger Woods play,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These scores are rather queer for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles with only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team fought for the whole weekend, trying to make a fuss, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who displayed the highest class of golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furic of the United States said after his team's discomfort, "I'm proud of these guys, they've been fighting.
This morning, we managed to shatter Europe a bit.
It didn't work.
Take off the hats in front of Thomas.
He's a brilliant captain.
All of his 12 players played excellent.
We're regrouping, I'm gonna work with America's PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're gonna move on with our success.
I love all 12 kids, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to be able to lose.
We've lost."
Red Tide: The news has reduced the concentration of micro-organisms in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The most recent report of the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife reflects the overall decline in the concentration of the red tidal in some parts of the Bay of Tampa.
According to FWC, in the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier, there is a high rate of blooming, indicating a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red Tide spans about 130 miles of the shoreline from the northern Pinell to the southern districts of Lee.
The oaks can be seen about 10 miles from the Hillsborough County, but the number has fallen significantly since last week.
The red tide is also observed in Pascoe County.
Last week, the average concentration in and around Pinellas was reported, from low to high concentration in the Hillsborough coast, high concentration in Manati and Sarasota and in the coasts, medium concentration in Charlotte County, high concentration on the Li County coast, and low concentration in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier, there is still a risk of respiratory irritation.
In Northwest Florida, this was not reported last week.
