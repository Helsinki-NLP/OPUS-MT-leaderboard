Number of new recruits ready to be sent to Donbas from Ukraine
Andrei Marocko, an official of the National Police of the self-proclaimed Lugono People ' s Republic (LNP), stated that Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbas in the winter of 2018-2019.
So, he said, Kyiv's planning to "have something to do with the units."
“The unwillingness of Ukrainens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, mass dismissals have led to a low number of units,” said Marocko, quoted by RIA News.
Nor has he ruled out that the real numbers of enlisted Ukrainians can be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kyiv began the so-called Anti-Terrorist Operation (APO), which was later reassigned to the Joint Forces (JOS).
This measure was intended to increase the role of Ukrainian militants in the resolution of the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbassa was exacerbated by the murder of the head of the DND, Alexander Zaharchenko.
The DNR authorities have described what happened as a terrorist attack.
In the course of the investigation of the criminal case, a number of persons involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary information, they confirmed that the Ukrainian intelligence services had sabotaged.
The U.S. authorities forced the Mask to leave the office of Chairman of the Tesla
An American businessman, Ilon Musk, will leave the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla, a company he founded, at the request of the United States authorities.
In order to settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman will also pay $20 million to settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission.
According to CNBC, the pre-trial arrangement with the agency allows the Mask to stay in Tesla.
In doing so, he is required to pay $20 million and to leave the office of Chairman of the Board of Directors within 45 days of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed to his seat.
It is made clear that the agreement still has to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it was reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had accused the Mask of misguiding the shareholders with an application for sufficient funds to buy the company's shares and sued the entrepreneur.
It's about a businessman on Twitter, where he said he wanted to buy Tesla stock for $420 a grand, but he never did.
After the tweet, the company's shares rose by almost 11%.
The head of the British MIDA compared the EU to the Soviet Union and the prison
The British Minister for Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunt, compared the EU with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of captivity to the member countries of the community.
The diplomat made such a statement at a convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham on Sunday, 30 September.
According to the Daily Mail, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to defend freedom, and the Soviet Union has not let anyone leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you transform the EU from a community to a prison, the desire to leave it will not be diminished, but will grow, and we will not be the only prisoner to run from captivity,” the Minister said.
He also added that trying to punish Britain for getting out of the European Union would only worsen the crisis, notes Gaceta.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Teresa May stated that the Brexit talks had stalled.
So she commented on the outcome of the EU informal summit in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was taken in 2016 by referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom was expected to take place before April 2019, but the negotiations with Brussels on the issue were complicated by a number of factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will work together after London has left the community.
In addition, the question of the Irish border remains open.

They account for about 35 per cent of financial income.
In the past, a rating of Moscow with the cheapest apartments in the new buildings was presented to the Bon Ton Real Estate Agency.

Telegram users have complained about a failure in the new version
Users of the iPhone have complained of problems in the Telegram messaging after an update on September 28.
The user's phone number can be obtained from the user's account
The complaints concern gadgets with an up-to-date iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, when updated, the application displays a white screen or closes it immediately.
The messaging officer reacted to a failure.
They said that the problem might be the migration of information to a new Swift application.
In Telegram, the application was temporarily suspended from being automatically updated until the bugs were resolved.
On April 13, the Tagan Court of Moscow granted Roskomnadzor's application for the blocking of Messinger Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, the communication operators began to implement the decision.
The reason for the misender's refusal to provide the FSB with the key to decrypting the correspondence needed to get the data on the terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed the policy of confidentiality and agreed to uncover the IP address and mobile phone number of a suspected terrorist user when a court decision was taken.
Telegram has been cut by 1.2 million after the blocking in the Russian Federation.
I'm glad for the kids who went out on the digital advantage in a game with the Minese Dinamo.
I'm glad for the kids who went out on the digital advantage in a game with the Dinamo.
Bob Hartley, the Chief Trainer of the Avangarde, summed up the results of the regular HLC match against the Minese Dinamo (2:1).
A very important win for us.
After the match in St. Petersburg, we held a meeting and agreed to leave the game behind and prepare for Minsk.
We knew Dinamo had a good win before we met, so we were getting ready very seriously.
It was important to drop in most, I'm glad for the kids who went out to realize the numeric advantage.
We've been playing pretty well in most of the time, but we can't do it.
At last, the red light was lighted outside the gate.
We knew that Minsk was gonna be loaded for the game, and he'd try, and that's how it worked.
The game in most of the game has become a determinative, win-win goal, and it's in an unequal composition that we've won.
We have been able to have a good third period today, despite the fact that we missed an early goal in this section, and it was clear that it would not be easy in the future.
But we played very well in the defense, we didn't give a lot of chances to the opponent, we didn't get caught on shifts, and Dinamo didn't have a number of attacks, so it all ended well for us, and that's what Hartley's press club said.

Ilon Musk has to leave the position of head of the Tesla Board of Directors
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the founder of Tesla, Ilon Musk, settled their dispute in the fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the TV channel, as part of the agreements reached, the Mask will have to leave the post of head of the Tesla Board of Directors.
At the same time, the commission allowed Mask to retain the post of Tesla's head.
The founder of Tesla is also said to have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount will be borrowed from Tesla.
In doing so, the money is distributed to the affected investors.
In addition, the company has to appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Musk is an American entrepreneur on the list of the 50 richest people on the planet in Forbes.
He is the head of the SpaceX Space Corporation, a neuronology company, and the developer of Tesla electric car, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission has previously sued Tesla Elon Musk's CEO for a Twitter report about a possible buyout.
Last month, Musk announced his plans to make Tesla a private company and to buy out all stock on the market at a fixed price of $420.
The value of the stock of $420 was allegedly “due to the importance of this number in the marijuana culture”, previously reported by Bloomberg, with a reference to the co-director of the security department of the Stephen Paykin Commission.
At the same time, Ilon Musk later gave up his plans to buy the stock.
Commenting on the US Securities and Exchange Commission's lawsuit against him, the businessman stated that he found the allegations of fraud unsubstantiated, and he added that he was very disappointed and saddened by the claims.
"Truth is the most important thing in my life, and the facts will prove I didn't break it in any way," said a businessman in an interview with CNBC.
In August, however, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective action against the Mask, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had cost them.
In particular, one of the shareholders stated that the businessman's tweets had been misled, making Tesla stock sellers forced to buy papers at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other complainants also noted that the careless statements of Ilon Mask had led to sharp swings in the course of the course.
In September, Ilona Musk was also accused of trading, and he was the head of the Citron Research research company.
In the meantime, if Musk had not been able to settle his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would have been at risk of being suspended from the company and even in prison.
In particular, CNBC's former commissioner, Harvey Pitt, stated this.
The mask is "a good guy who can't run a car company."
Real on his field couldn't beat Athletico.

The next round, "Real" will play out with "Alaves", and "Athletico" will take up "Betis" on his field.

The RPT compared the possible renaming of the CPI with the actions of the Nazis
The head of the Division of External Church Liaisons (OCTS) of the Moscow Patriarchate of the Mitropolitan Volocolin Ilarion compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Nazis in Germany.
Mitropolitan Volocolomsky Ilarion - about the causes of the conflict with the Constantinople Patriarchate, the possible clerical rift and its political connotation
In his words, now that “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in a critical stage”, to rename the Church is like in Nazi Germany, “Jews to put on a yellow six-point star”.
"This means labeling the Church as an enemy organization, and for this purpose this bill was created," said a representative of the RPT on the TV channel Russia 24.
The Mitropolitan Police also stressed that the UCP is not a Russian Church, but a Ukrainian Church, as “the believers of this Church think they're Ukrainian, they're patriots of their country”.
The OCP called on the Constantinople Exarchs to leave its territory
The Grand Prix in Sochi: an aisle, a Russian beard and the return of Kwiat
In the next 10 years, Russia can have its own race ball.
The vice-premier of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Kozak, made this statement, summing up a meeting with Russian automakers on the eve of the start of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
He also shared the view that Daniel Quyat would return to "Toro Rosso" and that the Russian phase of "Formula 1" would be attended.
As a result of our meeting with auto-producers, it is in the foreseeable future that the creation of the Russian Formula One, which has no analogues in the world, is expected to take place, says Dmitry Kozak.
We have to push our car manufacturers in this direction.
It was about plans up to 2024, but I don't think it's possible in such a time frame.
I think a more realistic time frame is within the next 10 years."
From 2012 to 2014, the "Marussa" team performed under the Russian License in Formula One.
According to the vice-premier, there are already investors who are ready to invest in the creation of a national team in the World Auto races in the Formula One class.
I know there are motor sports fans in Russia, rich businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of a Russian team called Formula One, he said.
"We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like this.
I suspect that the thought of setting up the team has also come about because of the infrastructure in Sochi.
The Sochi Autodrome's gonna be out tomorrow.
According to Dmitri Kozak, the organizers have been able to sell all 50,000 tickets.
Look, even at the qualifications of the stand, it was almost complete, the vice-premier remarked.
I can tell you that this year's revenue has risen by 72% over last year.
It's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing a plan of action to make the use of Sochi Autodrome infrastructure more efficient throughout the year.
This will be an extra tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dimitri Kozak and the main theme of the day for the Russian auto-sporters was the return of Daniel Quyat to the Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel together and wish him well next season, "the vice-premier said to the news."
He's a very hopeful rider.
Next year, for the first time in history, Formula 1 will be able to take part in the two main Russian pilots.
Although Sergey Orotkin's future in the Royal Races is still unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not as yet impressive: he was ranked 18th in Russia's Grand Prix.
Let's hope next season there will be more of our main pilots than this year, says Dimitri Kozak.

By the way, distilling penicillin from mold fungi was not Fleming's first discovery.
A few years earlier, when he was cold, he sown a mucus from his own nose on a Petri cup (this is a glass cap in which bacteria are experimented) and a few days later he found out that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
They found penicillin in almost the same way.
Fleming's name has been added to the list of the 100 most outstanding individuals in human history.
His discovery, in the view of many scholars, has changed the course of history.
With penicillin, medicine began to deal with most of the oldest diseases previously considered to be incurable - tuberculose, syphilis, gangrene...
When Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, soon after the Nobel Prize, the Paris newspapers said, "For the defeat of fascism and the liberation of France, he has done more than a dozen divisions."
Experts estimate that Fleming’s discovery of the world’s first antibiotic has saved the lives of more than 200 million people.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 from a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous London cathedral of St. Paul.
Where, by the way, my wife and I have been drawn up by a vocabulary Russian-speaking tour guide.
And a few more years later, Alexander Fleming's image was seen in the most unexpected place in the capital of Spain.
There, next to the main arena for the Corrida of Plasas de Toros de Las Ventas, the famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to a man who, in their view, saved the lives of hundreds of outstanding artisans of the Corrida.
By the way, this, in my view, very interesting porcelain work was found there in Madrid, but at a different time, not at all.

Trump talked about "love" in Kim Jong-un.
From the violence between the US and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, it was a joke by Donald Trump.
US President Donald Trump made a good joke about his success on the frontline of a solution to the North Korean crisis.
Beginning with the mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now remedied their relationship so much that they are almost in love with each other, the American President has noted.
The owner of the White House recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump pointed out that Barack Obama's team had so started a relationship with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that they couldn't even get to the country's leadership - it just didn't take off the phone.
At the time, the US and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House "pretty letters," noted Trump.
Trump admitted that at the start of his work, he was also "savage" to Kim Jong-un, which was, however, mutual.
But now their relationship has been refreshed so much that the leaders are "loving one another."
At the same time, Trump asked me not to take it literally and warned that the American media would interpret it as incompetence.
Trump noted that Pyongyang has recently halted nuclear and missile tests and has also closed military sites.
All of this is the merit of his administration, I'm sure the American President.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump lauded Kim Jong-un from the United Nations General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and the steps taken to de-escalate the tension.
Trump noted, however, that the sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea would continue until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

The positive outcome of the meeting was an end to the nuclear and missile tests of the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps to denuclearize North Korea are still on the brink.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the United States had already sent a number of disarmament scenarios to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangster."

Nice called for a “moscow language to be replaced by a Ukrainian product”
Ukraine's children's writer and mother tongue purity fighter Laris Nice called for “the Russian-language Moscow product and the Moscow language” to be removed from Ukraine.
To do so, it offers a Ukrainian product - a “cultural wave, a cultural push”.
Nice shared her views on the “advisability of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine” with the Ukrainian edition of the “Observator”.
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it is already on the table, and it is continuing to grow.
In time, the Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language," she's convinced.
For example, in neighbouring Poland, she said that the Russian language was used extensively on television and radio, but there was little left in public space.
In Nice's view, however, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities that prohibit the use of the Russian language are, in her view, merely “expanding the boundaries of the Ukrainian language at the legislative level”.
In the past, Nice shared her experience of the “Ukrainian-language regime” in the Carpathian Children's Camp, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court with a network of Watsons bookshops, one of whom was a cashier in the Russian language.
After not getting what it was, Nice threw the change at the girl.
The use of the Russian word by the Ukrainians is called "language schizophrenia", calling on the Ukrainians to give up the Russian letter even in the name.
Nice recently stated that the name "Rose" was stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The anger of the writer could not be avoided even by the Ukrainian Security Service: when she got there and heard the staff talking to each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left with the door shut.
During the break, we had a man talk, and it worked out.
Protector of Urala, Denis Kulakov, is about the victory of the Arsenal (2:1) in the ninth round of Russia's championship.
"Dennis, how do you think it was possible to win?"
"I think we wanted to win more," quotes Kulakov's official Web site Urala.
"The game was so hard, and in the break, we had a serious man talk, and it was a good thing to do: hit two balls and didn't miss it.
"You missed a number of matches due to the damage you got at the beginning of the month.
How'd it feel today?"
"If it lasted 90 minutes, it's okay!
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe at the end a bit of a shore of strength to keep it from happening.
So, the doctors and physiotherapist, Vladimir Anatolievich of the Gouchniev, led me to this game, for which I thank them very much!
"What do you say to the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's not a secret to anyone that after the wins, it's easier to recover, and the mood in the group is good.
Now we have a white streak, though it was black at first.
We have to keep doing this and make the fans happy."
"Missing the game in the time you didn't go to the field?"
"There's this, a bit of a miss, 'cause a really, bad situation has come out.
But again, thank the physiotherapist and the doctors for getting on their feet.
Most importantly, we won and we cheered the fans.
And the rest is secondary."

In a referendum in Macedonia, violations were recorded
Four incidents of violations of the electoral law have been recorded in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental renaming treaty with Greece.
This was reported on Sunday by the Spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, Tony Angelovsky.
Since the opening of the polling stations, there have been four incidents that have been resolved, he said.
At the polling station at the Laso Angelovski Elementary School in Skopje, 22-year-old K.J. disrupted public order and tranquillity, insulted citizens and assaulted the police.
He was detained and taken to the police station.
According to the MFA representative, all the intruders were immediately taken to the police stations.
The Ministry noted that all violations were subject to verification.
“The Ministry will act in accordance with the law to enable citizens to exercise their constitutional right freely to express their will.
We call on citizens to respect the law and to refrain from any disturbance of public order and tranquillity or any violation of the secrecy of the vote,” said the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
In the Sunday referendum, citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year-old dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek province.
On 17 June, the Heads of the MFA of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic at a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, bordering the two countries.
It provides for the use of the name of the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The treaty should not only resolve the multi-year dispute over the name of the country, but also open up the way to NATO and the EU.

Russia ' s decision to deliver air defence systems (SARCs) C-300 to Syria is a timely step.
This was the opinion of the head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Muallem, in an interview with RT, which aired on Sunday.

The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that C-300 was a defensive system, not an offensive system, and it was designed to protect the Syrian sky.

The charges against the Dutch MP are news.
The Mahachkala Soviet District Court held for two months a member of the Dagestan People ' s Assembly, Rajab Abdulatipov, who was suspected of being a member of a criminal association that constituted a disability for bribes.
The details of the investigation's material became known, which shed light on how, according to the Russian Examining Committee's version, the younger brother of the former head of the Republic, Ramazana Abdulatipov, Rajab Abdulatipov, had now facilitated the criminal actions of the former head of the General Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise, Magomed Mahachev, and his associates.
Among other things, in the course of the investigative and operational activities carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was found that Rajab Abdulatipov lobbied Magomed Mahachev for the post of head of the office, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles.
In the past, in the case of Magomed Mahachev, other leaders and members of the regional medical and social expert offices under his authority, a criminal case was brought under article 210 (creating and participating in a criminal association using a position of office), article 290 (receipt of a bribe by an organized group), article 292 (serving forgery) and article 159 (speaking in a particularly large manner) of the Criminal Code.
According to the records of the investigation, in late 2013, Rajab Abdulatipov, aware of the illegal actions of Magomed Mahachev and his accomplices in theft of the Pension Fund, joined their activities by joining the criminal community.
In the position of Head of the Department of the Federal Migration Service of the Russian Federation for Dagestan, and in connection with State authorities and law-enforcement agencies, and in his relationship with the head of the Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, the Investigators consider that “provided the activities of other members of the criminal community, made contact with State officials to support the illegal activities of Magomed Mahachev and his position as head of the federal penal institution, the Head of the Department of Medical and Social Investigation of the Republic of Dagestan, organized the illegal identification of persons with disabilities”.
After this information was made public at a meeting of the Soviet Regional Court on Friday, Rajab Abdoulatipov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, everything I'm charged with today is new to me, I don't know it at all," he said.
The court did not arrest a member of the Union of Russia for 10 days before the charge was brought, as was the case with the previous high-ranking Daguest officials, but for a period of two months, as article 210 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation appeared in his case.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much more time for the prosecution of an investigation, up to 45 days from the moment of arrest.

The President of Serbia would like to ask for Putin's support
The President of Serbia, Alexander Vuccic, will discuss with a Russian colleague, Vladimir Putin, the situation in Kosovo and ask for his support during a meeting in Moscow.
The President of Serbia, Alexander Vuccic, will meet with the Russian President, Vladimir Poetin, in Moscow.
During the meeting, he plans to discuss the current situation in Kosovo with a colleague from the Russian Federation.
In addition, Wuchich intends to ask for Putin's support.
The Serbian leader made a statement during a press conference, transmitting a local newspaper, The Evening News.
According to the source, the head of Serbia clarified that, in referring to the need for support from the Russian side, he was not referring to military support following the example of Syria.
Alexander Vuccic stated that he did not want to allow a scenario in which there might be any major military confrontations in the State.
The President of the country has pledged to do his best to keep the peace, and he has sent a publication.
In addition, according to the Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for Tuesday, 2 October, and writes "Lenta.ru".
The day before, it was reported that the Serbian President had put the army of the State on full alert due to the situation in Kosovo.
This is the case last Friday, when a number of dozens of Kosovo's Special Forces entered the area adjacent to the Lake, supplying water to the Gazivode hydroelectric power plant.
It is clarified that the hydroelectric power plant is located on the territory of Kosovo, but is in the Serbian power system.
Let us recall that Kosovo declared independence from Serbia 10 years ago, but in Belgrade it was not accepted.
Last spring, the parties halted the negotiations on this issue.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, the topic of Russia was virtually non-existent.
The head of the Federation Council Committee for International Affairs, Konstantin Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly to be a success for Russia, and does not rule out that it will be a turning point in the view of the Russian Federation as an integral part of the solution to global problems.
“The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric that we have almost become accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been more depressing,” said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years the Russian Federation had sometimes “noted as one of the three major threats to humanity, but in addition to the Ebola fever, the Russian Federation, together with climate change or terrorism, was in this category, at any rate, in a group of Western countries, which had expressed itself with some unanimity in this regard”.
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "the subject of Russia was virtually non-existent."
"If you look closely at the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the address of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at any rate, the choir was not quite accurate," he drew the attention of the politician, noting that Russia "was no longer a wall that was being practiced with a tennis ball."
The head of the Sovfed substantive committee does not rule out that this is an indication of a trend that, in his view, “will separate the current session [of the UN [Honsassemble], even though this trend may manifest itself in full in a year, in two, three”.
“I do not rule out that the current session may in some way be a turning point,” Kosachev admitted, explaining that “there are too many examples of how Russia is able to move forward in international affairs with it”.
He gave an example of the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be needed over time," he added.
This is due to the fact that he believes that there is a “adequate, sound view of Russia as not just a possible — an integral part in the solution of the global problems of our time”.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling we're going to go through a point somewhere where there's no going back, it's going to be moving forward," he added.
Another “intriguing and important sense” in this context, Kosachev called “the request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
“I have attended a lot of meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly] Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, and I have met with great pleasure, and I have seen that, if a year or two or five years ago, the Russian view of what is going on in the world, in large part, no one has asked, the situation is not the same,” said the Chairman of the Sovfed committee.
In his view, this is due to the fact that “the so-called new liberal order with the West has no answers to how to deal with the world's problems due to the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, a lack of ideas on how to deal with the problems of the Middle East, the problem of terrorism, the problem of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the problem of migration”.
“And here, the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more clear,” he expressed his confidence, stressing that in this sense he considered “the current session a good one for the work of the Russian delegation, a good one for Russia.”

In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that military force will not have to be used in the Syrian province of Idlib, has been declared by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Muallem.
He said that Syria was entitled to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey has an opportunity to quickly address the issue of the withdrawal of militants from the demilitarized zone in Idlib by the Russian-prohibited organization Jebhat al-Nusra, reports to RIA News.
The head of MIDA also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the territories east of the Euphrates if the Kurds wanted separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, the talks with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until the US halted.
On 17 September, Putin and the President of Turkey, Regep Erdoğan, agreed to establish a demilitarized zone by 15 October along the line of contact between the armed opposition and Government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry led the Chelsey Youth Team.
It was previously reported that a 37-year-old defender had been negotiating a move to the Moscow Spartacus.
According to RT, with a reference to Mirror, former captain John Terry of England led the Chelsey Youth Team.
According to the source, a well-known player who has been a member of the London Club for a long time will be in charge of the team at least 23 years of age.
It is noted that at the coaching headquarters, Terry will replace Jody Morris, who left for Durby County.
Let us recall, in September, Terry was close to moving to the Moscow Spartacus, but eventually gave up the idea after talking to his family.
The first vice-speaker of the Supreme Council, Irina Gerashchenko, apologised to a convict in the Russian Federation for "spionage" by a Ukrainian journalist, Roman Sushchenko, for not being able to release him from the lock-ups.
She spoke of this in a video address to a political prisoner on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko FSB.
According to her, there was an action under the wall of the Russian Embassy in Paris these days, in which a hunger protest was waged, demanding the release of the Kremlin ' s prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural leaders, among them, there are people who know you, who starve to support Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiation, no interview, no interview, no place for the President of Ukraine, no Ukrainian power, all of us, to demand pressure on the Kremlin, to put pressure on Putin with one demand: the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all the political prisoners of the Kremlin, and those who are illegally held in the occupied territories of Donbassa and Crimea,” said Heraschenko.
She also expressed her confidence that the tests would stab every Ukrainian, making us “angrier, stricter in the defence of Ukraine's national interests, in the protection of every Ukrainian, in the understanding of what is good and what is bad”.
Remember, the Ukrinform correspondent in France, Roman Sushchenko, was arrested on September 30, 2016 at Moscow airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with spying on the General Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years of maximum security, and the Supreme Court of Russia found the verdict to be legal.
The Russian jailers granted the last request of the Ukrainian prior to his sequel to the colony.

Wahtang Kikabidze for the Control of Cancer
Now a lot of artists talk about how they managed to cope with oncology.
The disease, unfortunately, spares no one, and the stories of popular people about winning the cancer give hope to a lot of the sick.
A prominent actor, Vahtang Kikabidze, confessed to being alive because of his wife.
Years ago, he got a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
"It's like I've been hit with a hammer down my head.
I fell.
I've lost my focus.
Put it in the hospital.
There couldn't hold a spoon, could not stand, fell all the time.
We've been doing tests, it turns out it's bad, the artery won't miss the blood.
They brought me to Moscow, and they said I had a big cyst in my head, and they had an emergency surgery.
And during the surgery, the doctors behind the cyst saw a tumor," he said in the "One Day" program.
The swelling turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to say good-bye to the idol at his doorstep.
But the actor's wife didn't let a live actor be buried, and she believed that she would be able to cope with the disease, and she didn't leave bed for over a year.
If it wasn't for Irina, I'd be dead right now.
Every time I had a critical situation, she was there like a rock," the actor confessed.
The actor has managed to cope with the disease, and he now lives happily in his home in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, the rumours of his illness, and of the untimely death, which is happening on the Internet.
The creators of the Peacemaker site put Peter Ciyarto, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, in the “Purgatory” section.
The reason was “the attack on Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
In addition, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the neighbouring country was found to be “direct threats of invading Ukraine” and “in support of separatist sentiments in Ukraine”, as well as to participate in “in the organization of a provocation aimed at mass violations by citizens of Ukraine of Ukrainian law”.
Let us note that the vice-president of Kievo Pecher Lavra Pavel and the leader of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) Onufriy have come to see Cijarto in the Purge.
Their opposition to the acquisition of Tomos by the Ukrainian local church was the result.
Earlier, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine in Zakarpatia, the President of Ukraine, Peter Porosenko, demanded respect for Ukraine ' s sovereign rights.
The authorities have named the sum of the golden parachute of the Vorones' super-gubernator.
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronesh Region, Yuri Agibalov, was made under the Regional Public Service Act.
The real sum of the “golden parachute” released from office was, however, a few times less than the sum reported in the media.
Such explanations have been provided by the regional government press service.
According to the Act, the salary for the office of Agibalov is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, in the press service, the one-time payment was 223,892 roubles less income tax, not 1 million roubles, which the media had written about.
He received an old-age pension from July 2018.
He has been in public office for more than nine years.
The award of this pension and a one-time payment is made to him as soon as he has been dismissed from office, and has been explained to RIA News in the Region Government.
At the same time, the payment of Aguilovo ' s pension supplements was suspended on appointment to the public service, and his salary has not changed from the previous period.
Winning Governor Vrio of the region, Alexander Gusev, took office on 15 September.
Agalibalov was released on the expiry of the term of office of the head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other public officials in the region have been completed.
On September 29, Telegram Channel, Nezigar, published documents that indicated that Agibalov, who had left the position of vice-governor, had paid a termination indemnity in the amount of 23 salaries, and two days later, he was re-entered without a vio.
Member of the State called on the school to tell the school about the harm of masturbation.
Onishchenko holds the post of First Vice-Chairman of the Education and Science Committee.
On the basis of his experience, he observed in an interview that youngsters are provoking harmful information on the Internet.
The fight is at the level of educational institutions and the family, and the MP added.
Gennady Onyshchenko, MP of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with Radio Voice of Moscow):
As part of the general sex education of children, it is necessary to do so by explaining the harm, because there is a risk to the sexual health of the child, both male and female.
The problem is objective, it's that the children's maturity is getting early, and there's a lot of scissors between their puberty and the ability to make formal contact between the two sexes.
Onishchenko is of the view that the solution to the problem is hampered by “faithfulness”, the silence of the “sexual age problem” and the lack of a culture of adequate child-rearing.
The doctor is confident that many youngsters face masturbation.
The MP is of the view that the practice of the harm of masturbation is first and foremost in the schools of the “hyperurbanized” regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, you and I will just not understand, to say the least," the Professor said.
Gennady Onishchenko is an active Academist of RAMN, a member of the Presidium of RAMN, a doctor of medical science, a professor.
A well-deserved doctor of Russia and of Kirgistan, a member of the bureau of the national health League of Russia.

ADH became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" has another record of popularity, and Angel Merkel's ratings are falling.
It seems that the Germans have become seriously tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has made the country a desirable target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most notably, recent social surveys have shown that the anti-immigration party “Alternative for Germany” is getting more popular, and the position of the ruling Merkel and Zeehofer bloc is getting weaker.
This week, the ADG broke another record with the second line of popular sympathies.
Right-wing conservatives with 17% of popularity managed to bypass social-democrats with about 16%.
A single-pronged gap can be translated into a statistical error, but one cannot help but note the fact that the ADG of a small group of Euro-Septic economists, created in 2013, has become a major political force.
The leadership in the total set-off has so far continued to hold the HCC/HDZ ruling block, which has about 30 per cent.
But there is a tendency to lose the points here - back in April, the support for the Angela Merkel bloc was four percentage points higher.
The German chancellor's personal rating, headed by the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also falling.
Nowadays, 48 per cent of the Germans are in favor of Angela Merkel, a 7 per cent lower than last year.
Let's add that the social demokrats are followed by the green (15%), the left (11%) and the liberals (10%).
Evolution of "Alternatives"
The "Alternative for Germany" party was set up in September 2012 on the basis of the "Alternative Choice 2013" group, which included members of the Christian-Democrat Union.
The group was initially opposing the government course, but in the first place it focused on economic issues, including the euro and EU interaction.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's “suggestion” of the weak economies of the EU, not excluding the possibility of a return to the German mark and a full country's withdrawal from the EU.
With the deepening immigration crisis, the ADG political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that took over the euro skeptics and began to critically criticize the government for the failure of the immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary election in 2017, ADH was able to make her first entry to the Bundestag with 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the "Alternatives for Germany" get a seat in the European Parliament.
A video of a journalist who called the Ukrainians a "nice of fools" was published.
Spoken in a political talk show on Ukrainian TV, author of two books, Ossep Drosdov, on live aired, admitted that he considered his compatriots to be a "stupid thing."
They believe in TV and don't read much.
As Drosdov has pointed out, it is hard to live and work in such a country.
"We have not been taught a culture of reading and accepting text since we were a kid," said a journalist.
The local nationalists immediately criticized Drosdov for his lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Television and Radio Broadcasting Committee of the Independent has begun to combat the literature, which has the slightest hint of criticizing the Kyiv authorities, by prohibiting the import of as much as 201 editions.

The Canadians created a car in case of apocalypse - a driving magazine
Anyone who wants to buy this car can buy it.
Rochel Defence Solutions stated that it was already accepting applications for its new armor.
Rochel Senator APC Apocalypse Armord
The theme of the apocalypse is not just the producers of video games, movie studios, and book publishers.
The new niche is now being developed by car companies.
For example, the Canadian Rosel Defence Solutions presented its armored armor of the Senator APC.
In time-free, this company's engineers are building armored vehicles for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are not very comfortable, but are fully securely positioned in a complete armored cassette.
This bunker, or otherwise it's not a design, because it has a B7 level of reservation, and it's installed on the wheelhouse of a strong Ford Super Duty pickup.
Its bottom, also armored, is able to protect the capsule from bombardment by grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Apocalypse Armored Salon of Rochel Senator APC
In order to keep the passengers from being harmed even by the blasting of a bomb next to the car, the car’s lounge is equipped with special depreciating chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.
The Rochel Senator APC is equipped with a round-the-clock viewing system with a night-vision function, as well as an inspection armored tower on the roof.
There's no gun in the car.
Front of the Apocalypse Armored Lounge of Rochel Senator APC
In order not to affect the vehicle's mobility, Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong turbo-diesel engine of 6.7 litres, the power of which is transferred to the four wheels of the armored vehicle through a 6-stage automatic gearbox.
There's no chance of getting stuck in the armored apocalypse of Roshel Senator APC
A special exhibition in Washington, D.C., will be held in October to see Roshel Senator APC armored.
Named the time of death of the universe
The universe is still about 140 billion years old, 10 times the age of the world, about 13.8 billion years.
A study of an international group of scientists has been placed in the library of electronics, arXiv.org, and has been sent for publication in the Journal of the Astronomical Society of Japan, as reported by the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
The HSC (Hyper Superrime-Cam) of Subaru in about 10 million galaxies has come to this conclusion.
After tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 per cent of the world's energy-mass, scientists, working within the standard cosmology model CDM ( > Cold Dark Matter), rated the expansion of the universe, which was a bit slower than previously thought.
A press release from the Subaru observatory states that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, while the European Space Telescope’s data records, Planck, have clarified the limitations on the ©CDM settings.
In July, scientists modelled on the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments to the effect that the world under review would end in 22 billion years as a result of the Greater Gap.
There was another attempt to merge the initiators of the pension referendum.
The opportunity to learn the people ' s opinion on pension reform is postponed for an indefinite period
A general federal action group against the raising of the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups, which registered the different language of the issues (in all, the Centre has recorded five).
They decided to apply to the CEC for the registration of a single action group and to ask the Russians, "Would you like the age set by the law on pension as of 1 July 2018, at which the Russians are entitled to an old-age pension, not to be raised?"
This language was registered by a sub-group of water, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered to be the simplest and most legal vessel.
The majority of the participants in the meeting were members of the “Just Russia” of Ilya Sviridov (six sub-groups) and KDPF (four sub-groups).
Three independent sub-groups, from Lower Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg, joined.
In the past, Sviridov said to the “Messages” that the invitations had been sent to all initiators, and some 40 sub-groups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, head of a sub-group of water (her formulation was supported by another 15 sub-groups), said, "We know that we didn't get the invitations and didn't plan to come, "We didn't know who the friend was and who the enemy was."
Blues singer Otis Rush died
At the age of 84, a well-known Chicago blues guitarist and singer Otis Rush died, reporting to AP with links to his manager Rick Bates.
He died as a result of complications following a stroke in 2003.
Mr. Rush's creativity has influenced musicians such as Carlos Santana and Eric Clapton.
He was well-known in 1956 after the release of the song "I Can't Quit You Baby", which took the sixth line of the Billboard R&B.
The Admiral has created a big problem for us.
Zinetula Bileletdinov: "Admiral" has created us a lot of problems.
Chief Coach "Ak Barsa" Zinetulah Billelettinov summed up the results of the regular KHL match against "Admiral" (4:2).
"The tricky game was, it's complicated.
The rival's been a good fighter, he's been putting us in a lot of trouble.
I'm glad we played pretty well in most of us today.
I've already told you that someday the hollows will come, the main thing is we'll be working on it.
And that we won is also very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripov a break in this series?"
"We have our own program on which it works.
So there was this solution," quotes the club's Billalettin Press Service.
Ilon Musk will leave the position of head of the Tesla Board of Directors
According to the agreement, Mr. Musk will be required to leave the office of Chairman of Tesla's Board of Directors and to pay a fine of $20 million.
In doing so, the businessman will retain the position of Chief Executive Officer of the company, reporting to the AFP with a reference to the regulator.
Tesla will also have to pay a $20 million fine.
Previously, the regulator sued Ilon Mask - the officials thought he had misled Tesla's investors, as the businessman allowed the company's stock to be bought at a high price of $420 for paper.
In the Loko match, "Achmat" Turbine's mistakes fell out of the ear of plenty.
A former all-union judge, Vladimir Levitin, commented on the work of arbiter Eugenius Turbine in the 9th round of Russia's Locomotive, "Ahmat", and addressed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you judge Eugenius Turbine in the Locomotive-Ahmat match?
- I believe this arbiter has confirmed his unfitness for the justice of the Russian prime league.
I am amazed that the spree of the fifth round of "Spartake" - "Dinamo", not Turbine himself, nor the DSI leaders, have drawn serious conclusions about his low skill.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: the error in his actions, the private omissions of the brutals fell out of the ear of plenty.
For example, at the 50th minute, the railroadman, Eder, with the help of his hands, is hurled down in his fine square by the Protector of Akhmata Rodolfo.
It's eight meters from the gate, but Turbine doesn't put a penalty on it.
- How do you rate the episode of Idov, who was at the 82nd minute when it seemed like the ball hit his arm?
- I think it was a premeditated hand-play by a lawyer in his fine square.
Turbine was next to the moment, and he can see the episode and his first assistant on the right.
Judge Sergei Karasev should have seen this moment.
Still, all three fell asleep, and the penalty was not set.
So the score in the match was distorted, and sports justice was shattered.
It was the very time when the court of justice was replaced by the spirit of the game and buried it.
- At the 52nd minute Turbine didn't decide to remove Oleg Ivanov's guest defender, who broke the rules in the fight against Krikhovyak, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you have to show the second mustard?
- At this point Turbine and the first yellow card didn't show up on a case-by-case basis.
The second one would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of the judiciary, that some crews are being punished for violations such as the Idova episode, and some of them are not.
What do you value from a football player?
- Depends on what it means by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't give it to me.
So the arbiter won't give a second penalty to the opposite gate.
Here's the principle that's being used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge watches who's playing.
Here he played the Locomotive on Saturday, and Ahmat has serious concerns about Turbine's work, because the team has been shattered.
Matt Damon played the man charged with raping Judge Cavanaugh at the start of the SNL.
American actor Matt Damon has been a candidate for the United States Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh, who is charged with rape.
Damon appeared in the first release of the new season, "Saturday Night Live" on NBC.
In a small sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at the senate hearing on the charge of rape.
A candidate to the U.S. Supreme Court has previously drawn attention to his emotionality and detail of his stories in an interview with Senator Amy Clobushar.
For example, Cavanaugh has repeatedly confessed to his love for beer, but he has said that he has never been drunk.
Also, in an attempt to justify himself on the charge of rape, Cavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
Damon also played these moments.
I've been doing a lot of drinking and not thinking about sex at all.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin anyone's ever seen.
Everyone knows it," said the judge in Matt Damon's performance.
Cavanaugh was previously elected Supreme Judge of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found her cloned dogs bizarre in their behavior.
The American singer Barbra Streisand claimed that her dead dog clones were very different from the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, [clons] look like her, but it's not possible to clone a soul," stressed a 76-year-old singer.
In late 2017, Straisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old coton-de-tuller dog, named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the Chihuahua dog called Miracle Millie, the world's smallest dog, was cloned for the 49th time.
Professionals are trying to clone a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The US was thinking about Russia's maritime blockade due to the oil and gas supply.
In the US, Russia’s maritime blockade can begin to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The American authorities have been so aggressive in the fight for success in the world market for hydrocarbons, that they are ready to resort to the maritime blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world’s major energy suppliers.
Ryan Zinke, head of the U.S. Department of Internal Affairs, told us about the possibility of a maritime siege the previous day.
Contrary to global practice, the United States Department of the Interior was not a policeman, but a citizen, including a natural resource policy.
Therefore, Zinke ' s statement was within the competence of the agency he led, although it was not devoid of a political colour.
Addressing an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that the US Navy controlled the maritime routes in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary.
From Zinke’s words, it was clear that the need might be linked to Washington’s desire to hinder Russian supply to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive a lion’s share of its revenues from the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, as in Eastern Europe, was the main reason for the upsurge of Moscow in the region, I believe Zinke.
The Minister has made it clear that the US is still looking to be a leader in the world energy market, becoming the largest oil and gas supplier.
To do so, Washington will have to stifle Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockage of trade routes – an acceptable measure on the way, Zinke believes.
The Kalmian director got good reviews of the festival.
Our countryman, actor Eugenius Sangagjiev of Gohol Center, and his film "Harmony" have been given a special reference to the members of the sixth Jury's debut festival, "Movement", held in Omsk.
The name of the festival certificate states that "this is a signal for the immediate response of the major industrial players in the movie."
As is well known, the picture of a young Kalmian director was presented in the short film program "Movement, Start", where eight filmmakers took part.
The main award in this competition program was a picture of "Iana is Anja the reverse", the director's debut of the actress Jan Glady.
The focus of the National Film Festival for the Debut of the "Motion" is on a young movie, not in terms of age, but in terms of their spirit, will, and ability to risk.
And P. Chonkushov, a student at the Elisteen Academy of Arts, and Yevgeny Sangajeev's RATI-GITIS meet all these requirements.
He's young, talented, creative, and in his creativity, he's looking for new, unorthodox forms of self-expression.
Over 300 Syrians left the Idlib de-escalation zone in 24 hours
The Idlib de-escalation zone in Syria left 301 in 24 hours, including 141 children, on the evening of 29 September at the Warring Party Reconciliation Centre.

Supersonic passenger planes in the Russian Federation will be used for production
The production of supersonic passenger jets in Russia will begin in 2030.
The Director-General of the Zhukovski Kiril Sipalo Central Institute of Aero-Hydro-Dynamics said this.
He said that the Science Center was working on supersonic issues, both in international consortia and in cooperation with the Minprompromtorium.
"As we feel, it will take us two to three years to get a technology displayer, as well as 10 to 15 years to get a serial car that can be used to transport our country," he added.
He clarified that there was now a question for Russian experts on how to make technology cost-effective and safe at the same time.
At the beginning of September, the PAO developer, Tupolev, announced the completion of pre-design work on a supersonic passenger aircraft, and it is estimated that the aircraft will be able to speed up to 1,900 km/h at an altitude of 11 km.
This was reported by Valery Solozobov, the Deputy Director of Business.
The President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, thanked the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, for making Ukraine more European.
He announced this on CNN.
He stated that he could only confirm the words of the columnist Washington Post that Putin’s aggression against Ukraine had led to the unification of the Ukrainians.
"In 2013, the trans-Atlantic integration of Ukraine, joining NATO, supported 16% of the Ukrainians.
Now it's over 54%.
Who did this?
Poetin.
In 2013, European integration of Ukraine, joining the EU, supported 33% of the Ukrainians.
It's 74%.
Who did this?
Putin," said Poroshenko.
So thank you, Mr. Putin, for making my country much more European and much more ready to defend European and trans-Atlantic values.
And we are absolutely certain that we will not return to the Russian Empire,” stressed the President of Ukraine.
In late September 2018, President Peter Poroshenko was in the United States and participated in the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly.
He also visited the grave of a great friend of Ukraine, Senator of the United States (1987-2018), John McCain.

Formula 1 Russia’s Grand Prix
There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
The former captain of the Chelsey and the England team, John Terry, was involved in a match for the ninth round of the Russian "Spartake" - "Rostov" (0:1).
"In Russia, I have a club I'm following.
I've been watching it very recently, and I was curious to see it from the outside.
I can't say I'm a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but my sympathies for Spartak I have and I want to apologize again for the decision I made," quotes Terri on the Chelsey fans' website.
Remember, Rostau, with 18 points, went up to number three in the tournament table, and Spartak, on the fifth line, with 15 points in stock.
On the next round, the red-and-white on 7th of October will play with Enicea, and the caretakers of Valeria Carpine will receive Orenburg the day before.
The dear violin was put in a pawn shop for nothing.
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan Loan in Somerville, Massachusetts, for an old and unpresentative tool, a pawn shopman offered only $50.
But an experienced shop manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected it was an old-fashioned and expensive tool, and asked for advice from an expert.
And that's where it turns out the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master, Ferdinando Gallano, and it's worth $250,000.
The violin links alone are estimated to be between US$ 16 and US$ 18,000.
The investigation found that the violin was recently taken from one of the city's residents, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the man who put it in the pawn shop, but it was not followed by any previous confrontations with the law.
The manager says that everyone who brings a violin to the lombard will be asked to play it to make sure it's actually the client's.
In the ninth round of the RPL, we are facing an intriguing stand-off: "Spartacus" will receive "Rostov" at its Stadium in Tushin, under the leadership of Valeria Carpin, a man who is known to be no stranger to the "people's team."
The fact that the club now has an equal number of 15 points, and it divides 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, lagging behind the far-flung Zenith, and being in the same cell as the Red-Dar who is playing with Dinama tomorrow.
The red-and-white people are in a difficult spot right now: the club is once again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, Massimo Carrera's team suddenly landed "Rapidu", and has recently given way to the house "Achmata."
After the Derby with the CSKA, which was finished by a fair tie, Spartak played at the Black Sea Cup with a minimal score, and it is too early to say if Russia's most popular club has come to an end to the crisis.
The "Rosto" three matches in a row couldn't win, but he didn't know the defeats for five.
Let's see if Carpina can extend the win-win series with such a fundamental match.
The previous meeting between the Carpinese Rostau and Spartak ended in favor of the Metropolitan Team.
Start at 7:00.

London has been aroused by the charges against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the Cold War, the British Minister of Defence, Gavin Williamson, said.
But England will defend its values, he stressed at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham.
More and more threats, Iran and North Korea are becoming more and more perilous, and the enemies are operating in the grey areas through cyberattacks and false news, added the Minister.
But the biggest one is Russia, which is building up its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic.
Such statements by Western politicians have been rebutted by Moscow on a number of occasions, and they are sent to TASS.
At the same time, the head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunt, said that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not follow international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March this year, ex-colonel Sergey Skripal, who was convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Julia.

Translator compared the mentality of the Russians to the Germans
The mentality of the Russians and the Germans is different, but the few differences between them do not play a major role in understanding.
On 30 September, the International Translator's Day, a professional synchronist, Berbel Sachse, spoke about this.
She has been in translation from Russian and English for over 30 years.

According to the Interpreter, to understand that two countries need to know each other's history.
And in the future, Saxe remarked, Germany has no point in ignoring Russia.

The best actor was named Dario Grandinetti, an Argentine for the movie "Red" (Rojo).
The director of the same movie, Benhamin Ney state, was ranked as the best director.
The comedy "Night School" was led by an American box office.
The Sunday School comedy, which debuted at American movie theaters last Friday, made $28 million for her first weekend.
This result allowed an unthinkable picture with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to lead the United States box office from September 28-30.
On the international market, the film, so far released in only 20 countries, has raised $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the fight for the first line, the creation of Malcolm Lee, which is remarkably appreciable, has outstretched another Western-running newcomer, a cartoon called "Smolfoot", a curious history of a charming Bigfoot to a man who the main character never believed in.
The Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig's project for their start-up weekend raised 23 million dollars, in total meeting the expectations of the experts who predicted the tape 20 to 25 million a week.
As for the sum of Smolfoot, it is now $38.6 million (and it has debuted in 50 countries), the most active one being Mexico, which has filled the film with $3.6 million in cash.
The three of the best this time was shut down by the children's fairytale "The Mystery of the House with the Hours" from the master of the horrors, Eli Roth, who finally proved that the director was able to make a good movie for the audience.
In her second week of renting a screenshot of John Bellers' book with the charming Jack Black and Kate Blanchett made $12.5 million, bringing the global total to 53.8 million.
Despite his departure from top 3, he continues to be amazed at the sign "+" Triller with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick "Simple request": in 17 days in the United States, a picture of Paul Fig, from which some unreal financial performance was not originally expected from the word "totally", raised $43 million (including $6.6 million for 28-30 October) and now has as much as 62.9 million in total.
The last representative of the first five this week was the Choror of the "The Curse of a Nonne" who collected $5.4 million over the reporting period.
Spin-off "The spells" for 24 days in American (and not just of course) cinemas have $330 million in total earnings and has recently been proud to be the most successful movie of the franchise, which also includes two parts of the spell itself and two tapes on Annabelle's horrendous doll.
Just after Corinne Hardy's horror, another member of the genre, the debutant of the Hellfest, one of the year's major youth horrors, was placed in the last weekend.
On his first weekend, a well-known editor (and with a recent director) Gregory Plotkin, who used to work on a number of big choror projects, including "Happy Death Day", on which Hellfest is very similar, made $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the movie, the result is very positive.
The seventh was "Insanely Rich Asians" ($4,15 million), who seem to be not thinking of falling out of the top 10 of the American box office: a romantic comedy that has been on the screen for the seventh week, and September is the sixth highest in the history, with a value of 165.7 million.
This is the sum of the current picture on the domestic market - the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million.

From the next week's premiere, the musical melodrama of "Star Born", the recipient of the Venetian Film Festival from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama of "Your Hate."

Valery Belov: God was helping Siberia today.
The Chief Trainer of "Vitia" Valery Belov, who was defeated by Siberia (3:4) in the regular KHL championship.
"The college was talking about the Siberian fans, and I want to celebrate our fans," quotes Belov's official Web site "Vitze."
"I hope they'll also support it, 'cause now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
In the game, perhaps God was helping Siberia today, because they were very wrong, especially our leaders.
We've all lost a small game -- a match of zero, three of our top leaders, so it's been hard for us to get out of this game, even though we've had moments.
But still, I'll take the blame.
'Cause you must have missed something in preparation.
It was a different team compared to the last match."
"It's a detestable cummy."
The audience is dismayed by Agutain's choice of the Voice show.
The audience of Voice 60+ is blaming Leonid Agutin's mentor for "small camouflage and brazen scam."
When in blind auditions he first learned the voice of his father, Nikolai Agutin, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not return to the performer.
But the son's feelings won over, and he chose a relative on his team.
At the time, a lot of people thought it a joke, but forgave the coach the partiality of the first step.
But the joke took a long time, and the star's father took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the viewers are not ready to forgive Agutina such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the viewers of the show, resented the insidious and frank push of our next of kin to the final staircase.
I even doubted that Agutina would have the strength and the conscience to keep her dad out of the first place,” Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larin reasoned on the TV Man program.
In the meantime, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutin "sleed" the beautiful performers who actually sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a moving song about his mom, explaining it by what the audience still wanted to see in his dad's show.
But, as it turns out, it's not the case, the viewers want an objective assessment, and they want to see really talented performers in the final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I'm so sorry for the members of The Voice of the Aoutine Team, they were doomed."
"The last time Agutin showed how much he loved Dad, "and today he was supposed to be a pro."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"Remove two talented people from the project and leave his dad in the project who's not singin' but whispering, how can you call a mentor after that?"
"I like the way dad sings, make him a concert in the Kremlin for your money, and see how many people come to this concert."
It's the Voice show, not the Bloody Relatives show.
"It was unprofessional from Agutain."
"Then you have to give your own show a show to Dad, not a show to do for the money of Channel One."
"This was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't see why a silent dad should make me understand more than any other player with real Vocal data.
Why was a surgut worker with a brilliant voice and a tembro drained, and Father Agutina got to the end?
And then we all complain about the same faces on the stage and on the screens for decades!
'Cause you can't get through the chimney!"
"What were you waiting for?
That's Russia!
There's a circle of blah and cunning.
And there's a lot of money in the family budget!

Military Canada has been allowed to wear beards to raise the spirit
The Department of Defence of Canada has issued an order allowing the military to wear beards.
According to CBC, the bill contains instructions on beard care.
It is noted that the military may be ordered to shave “for security reasons”.
The military beard cannot be longer than 2 cm, it must also be carefully trimmed, and the neck and cheekbones must be shaved.
At the same time, Marines were allowed to wear a beard on land only.
The innovation is expected to “enhance the moral spirit in the army and bring more Canadians to the service”.
The ban on wearing beards has been in force in the Canadian Army since World War II.
It was previously reported that the French police had also been allowed to wear beards and even to have tattoos.
At the same time, the court in Egypt upheld the suspension of police officers who wore beards.

As of tomorrow, Russia will begin to be fined for infractions in the field of equity-building, and it will be sent to Russia 24.
The penalty is to be imposed on companies and officials if they do not send the data on the building in time to the Single Housing Information System.
Innovation will help those who choose to buy an apartment in a new building but are afraid of the builder’s bankruptcy.
This was discussed at a conference in St. Petersburg for the construction industry.
Because of the amendments to the law on construction, the developers will have to lend full credit to the bank.
And a lot of the experts have already talked about the possibility of a massive hike in the apartments.
But as it turns out, not everyone agrees.

The incident took place on the evening of 29 September on Ivan Kudry Street, and was reported to be by the police.
According to the victim, the unsub approached him and started a conversation, but he suddenly grabbed the knife and demanded that he be given the money and the mobile phone.

A scientist spoke about a possible scientific program for a Russian mission to the moon.
The head of the RAN Institute for Space Research, RAN-Correspondent Anatoly Petrukovic, told RIA News about a possible research program for Russian cosmonauts on the moon.
He said that the scientific community was in the process of developing a course of action for such work.
"Consolidated opinion not yet", the scientist stressed.
He noted that one option was to place a low-frequency radiotelescope on the back of the moon, so as to avoid interference from the Earth.
"This is the only place that such a telescope can be deployed to explore space-derived radio-radiation sources," he added.
He also believes that the moon could be used to test robotics, to use local resources to build.
In addition, a scientist believes that astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organics on Earth.
This could help to determine how life emerges on the planets.
The head of Roscosmos had previously said that the Russian Federation, in an optimistic way, could fly to the moon by 2030.
An offended client chucked out a basket of feces at 7-Eleven.
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old Saint-Petersburger, called Florida, had a tooth on the manager of a 7-Eleven 24-hour shop: in May, he kicked him out of the shop for bad behavior.
So he decided to avenge his enemy in the original way.
In the middle of the second night, he entered the shop and poured it on the floor and on a part of the items on the shelves, the contents of the basket that he brought with him.
The basket contained feces and urine that Simms "borrowed" from a nearby mobile biota.
The police who arrived at the scene arrested the "Avenger."
He was put in jail and released on bail at $300.
He was charged with illegal intruding in someone else ' s property and criminality, and was not allowed to go to the shop and approach the manager.
Although Simms' crime is more funny than serious, the sentence may be rather severe, as he has repeatedly violated the law: theft in large sizes, theft, illegal possession of arms, drunk driving, and cruelty to animals.

Recker reported having received an informal invitation on the eve of the opening on Friday, 28 September.
According to her Spokesman, such a proposal should be viewed as late and not serious.
In an address in front of the mosque, Erdogan summed up a two-day visit to Germany.
The President described them as successful, he said, and he was able to meet with Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeyer and Chancellor Angela Merkel, with whom he discussed, inter alia, the fight against racism and Islamophobia.

The BU identified and detains the owner of the Peugeot 301 car, who traveled through the capital the previous day with license plates of the so-called NPR.
It turned out to be a former member of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, who is currently an agent of an insurance company in Ukraine.
According to the U.S. Press Center, the detainee explained that the car had been wanted by Interpol since 2014, and was therefore detained in Russia and handed over to him as a representative of an insurance company.
When he crossed the Ukraine-Russia border, he removed his fake license plates, but at the time of his entry to Kyiv, he re-entered them.

In the United States, a possible maritime blockade of Russia was declared.
The United States can, if necessary, impose a maritime blockade on Russia to prevent its supply of energy to the countries of the Middle East.
The U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, has said so.
Addressing an industrial event in the American city of Pittsburgh, the head of the agency stated that the only source of income for the Russian economy was the sale of energy, and Moscow was pursuing an active policy in the Middle East to sell oil and gas, as it was doing in Europe, by Washington Examiner.
Zinke also noted that the same was true of Iran.
In the view of the Minister, there are two options for the solution: military and economic.
He would have preferred not to use the first, so pressure must be put on Iran ' s energy resources.

Sergei Orothkin: I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
The Russian pilot Williams, Sergei Orotkin, commented on the result of the Russian Grand Prix.
"Truly, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn, I ended up between the two cars, and I got hit by it.
I've lost all the positions I played at the start, the moment, right away.
He was in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We hope that after the rest of us go to the pit stop, we'll get to clean air, and we'll get back to the pace, but the rubber's gone.
Plus wrestling with a partner, he was in touch with, too.
I take it he's a bit mistaken.
We were in this situation on the slowest track of the season, and I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful, to be fair.
I don't want to talk about it any more," quotes Orokin RIA's "News."
Let us recall that the Orotin in the race at Russia's Grand Prix finished on the 18th, and the British pilot Lewis Hamilton was the winner.
Tarpishev called it absurd to suspend Glušakov and Jenko from the base of Spartacus.
The President of the Federation of Tennis of Russia (FTR) Shamil Tarpešchev commented on the suspension of the footballers of the Moscow "Spartak" Denis Glušakov and Andrey Jennko from training with the main members after the liquor to criticize the main coach of the Massimo Carrera team, reports "Sport Weekend".
Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
Look at things like this, it's a fool of the world.
I totally disagree with what Carrera's doing.
It only deepens the disunity of the team.
First of all, it's a verse, you can read and read it as you like.
I wouldn't have reacted to it if I was Carrera.
You know, everyone has a different opinion.
Second, everyone wants to have a good time.
If Glyushakov and Jenko are liking, that doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to view the situation.
And it's not the normal climate on the team.
Today, Spartacus has no game, so it didn't have to be a big deal.
Maybe we should have laughed about it together.
Spartacus has a lot of problems in different ways, and there's a lack of identity after being a member of the youth.
The relationship within the team does not seem to add optimism before this match," I'm sure Tarpshawk.
The game will take place on September 30, and will start at 7:00 in Moscow time.
John Terry, who had previously refused Spartak, led the Chelsey Youth Team.
Sirius students discussed natural-like technologies with scientists.
School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, “Sirius” education centre in Sochi, attended a lecture by scientists from the national research centre “Kurchatov Institute”.
A presentation by researchers took place within the framework of a programme of the Global International Forum on Convergence-like and Nature-like Technologies, organized in Sochi at the request of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on the website of the educational centre on 29 September.
The lecture was opened by a documentary film entitled "Courchatov's Codes", in which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, RAN-Correspondent Michael Kowalchuk, spoke about global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The student's lecture is published on the Syrius website.
Schoolteachers have learned that modern technology needs an immense amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet in a position to produce such amounts.
This problem, according to the organizers of the forum, will be addressed by the natural technologies that young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kowalchuk raised the issue of responsibility for the development of natural-like technologies, as well as the risks inherent in the creation of such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, a immense good.
It's an explosive growth in medical technology, it's an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
The development of natural-like technologies is in fact a technological replication of wildlife systems.
There's a back-to-back side - focused intervention in human activity.
There's always a risk.
There was a car, and people began to die under the wheel.
But they still use cars.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I'm creating a medical new technology, and I can build a weapons of mass destruction," quotes the scientist REN TV.
After watching the movie and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask the participants questions.
The speakers were Mr. Physics and Mathematics, Mr. Vyacheslav Demin, Head of the Kurchatov Complex of NBIX-Natural Technology, “Kurchatov Institute”, and Mr. Iulia Diakov, Chief of the Courchat Complex of IBEX-Technologies.
The “Sirius” educational centre in Sochi was set up by the “Talant and Success” Foundation, based on the Olympic infrastructure, at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The aim of the educational centre is to identify, develop and further professionally support gifted children.
Previously, in September, it was reported that the All-Russia online online online digital security champions, Cyberbrises, would be sent to Sirius for training.

Macedonia: The referendum was not held due to a low turnout
The referendum was intended to endorse an agreement between the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country to “Northern Macedonia”.
Greece objected to the Macedonians using the name of their historical province.
The change of name led the former Yugoslav Republic to open the way to NATO and later to the EU.
But, as EFE reports, only 34% of the Sunday plebiscite's appearances have been "not reached" by 50% of the constitutional threshold.
However, since the referendum was only of a consultative nature, the authorities in Skopje might decide not to give up the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polls, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zayev, a supporter of the change in the name of the Republic, said that if there was more yes among the votes cast, Macedonia would change the name despite an unattainable Quorum.

Kemerovchan has stirred up a herd of sheep at the cemetery.
On September 30, a well-known Kemerovo page on the social network was reported by an eyewitness that a local cemetery was free to be used by horned animals.
A large herd of animals swept between the fences and plucked the grass.
The commentators expressed different views: some of the locals noted that there was no harm in the presence of small-scale cattle in the cemetery, and their appetite could even help to clear the area from weeds and grass, but some of the city ' s inhabitants did not enjoy the following:
"This is a grave, not a pasture.
There's nothing for the rams to do.
Of course, you can't say they're sacrificing, but it's not a big deal." (Style saved) - she said in her message, an indignant Kamerian.
In one way or another, one of the eyewitnesses said that the animal problem in the middle of the cemetery was already known, and action would soon be taken.
To push and to win - how is it right?
There's no word to push.
Right - to get over it.
The word "press" in the meaning of "stress, influence, influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound of [a] instead of [o] in the word "satisfaction."
We use this word to think it's from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "satisfaction" are not only not close, but even in a way the opposite.
Make sure you do.
Length (church-book, old-fashioned) means "satisfied, full, sufficient to be sufficient for anyone or anything, to satisfy."
Satisfaction, pleasure is relative.
He used to have the meaning of "not depending on anything, having a self-satisfied value" - "to be content with yourself."
Old-Slawish "wowl'ti" is related to the words "give" and "will."
Pushing, crushing, it's completely different.
In these words, the real frightening "family" is daos - "wolf" (throwing sheep), deyja - "death" and dvaid ¶ - "coerce."
The analogy of the word "pressure" and "satisfaction", as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter, has led them to contaminate.
So we have this very "d" that is used in a letter through "a", which is, in a good way, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the creation and evolution of those words.
So, right, let's do it.
But this word is obsolete, in its proper meaning, no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from the top, use the word "press."
You can also use a "pressure" design, but remember, it's a cleric.

Russia, through an operation in Syria, shielded itself from terrorists
In three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists have been killed, 85,000 of whom have destroyed the Russian Air and Space Forces.
On the occasion of the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former head of the FAC, Victor Bondarev, the head of the Federation Defence and Security Council.
He noted the high level of precision in the use of air-to-air weapons: the air-to-space forces have been and continue to attack the targets of the terrorists.
According to Bondarev, in three years tens of thousands of terrorist sites have been destroyed in Syria, such as ammunition depots, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian air strikes, the defense of the jihadists was hacked, a decisive contribution to the advancement of the Syrian Government's forces, handing over Interfax.
In doing so, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria has made it possible to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the start of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the “Islamic State” (IS, prohibited in Russia) and the “Jebhat al-Nusru” (prohibited in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the IG side, some 4,000 Russians and some 5,000 citizens of the post-Soviet countries have been in the war, handing over TASS.
And it's just the listed individuals, not including those who have not been identified, that he underlined Bondarev.
Most of them have been trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports have given them the right to enter our country freely.
So, Bondarev said, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism at a far-flung point, or it would have been “to us. ”

Syria has accused the US of supporting terrorism
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Muallem, has accused the US and its partners of war crimes in Syria and support for terrorism.

The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria was almost over, and the country has become more secure and stable.

At the same time, the Head of State supported the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the passport scandal with Hungary, which was to send the consul of that country out of the coast.
"I fully share every letter that the MFA has said," the President remarked.
According to FACTA, on 19 September a video was made available on the Internet of the time of the issuance of Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine at the Hungarian Consulate in the Bank of Hungary.
In doing so, they vowed their allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavel Klimkin, said that the consul of Hungary, who was on the video of handing out Hungarian passports to the Ukrainians, was to leave Ukraine either by the decision of Budapest itself or would be expelled by Kyiv.

Mitropolitan Ilarion compared Kyiv's decision to change the name of the PNC to the actions of the Nazis
The head of the Synod Division of External Church Liaison of the Russian Orthodox Church, Mitropolitan Ilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Nazis against the Jews.
"It's like, in Nazi Germany, to put a yellow star on a Jew, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and for this purpose, this bill was created," said the mitropolitan on the TV channel Russia 24 (the Interfax quote).
In his view, this step will have the most serious consequences at a time when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is at a critical stage.
Kyiv thus hopes to have full control over the CCP and to “make it out of the way of the law”, the clerical practitioner believes.
"This is the Church of Ukraine, and the believers of this Church think they're Ukrainian, they're patriots of their country," he added.
In the past, it has been reported that members of the Supreme Union are working on the implementation of Bills No. 4128 (on the change in the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on the change in the name of religious organizations).

The vice-president of the Pochayev laurel called for the protection of the Orthodox and Ukrainian shrines
The vice-president of the St.-Uspen Pochayev laurel, Mitropolitan Vladimir, made a call for the protection of the Orthodox faith and the Ukrainian shrine.
The text of his address to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UPC) was published on Saturday on the website.
At various times in history, our predecessors and their relatives in faith and spirit had to profess their faith and defend their holy places.
In view of the situation, and according to the information available to us, and the death threats that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to deal with something,” said the Mitropolitan.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
Also, the viceroy of the laurel stressed that it might be "necessary to have your physical presence."
The minister added: "Lenin's grandchildren, by spirit, threaten to kill, so we will defend our holy place."
Who cares about the fate of the Pochayev laurel, the Orthodox Ukrainian and the universal shrine, needs to be ready to defend it, as stated in the address.
The Mitropolitan called on those who misled the believers not to go about it.
The PCE has a canonical status, defined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to make it dependent on the news patriarch and the friend of the Roman pope Bartholomew.
The new style, with its consequences, is not acceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are content with the status that our church has," remarked the viceroy.
He recalled that the CPI had been canonally independent and fully independent in its administration since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
What other Tomos do we need?", remarked the Mitropolitan Pochayevski Vladimir, calling on the believers and all the citizens to ask, "Does the other Tomos have any creeds, are they independent of the Vatican?
The believers have sorted out to some extent, and have determined to what kind of temple to go to.
But some want to sow resentment and discord.
Some are envious that the dome is shining on the temples that they want to destroy," the minister stressed.
The Postajew laurel is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The laurels are located on the top of the Postajew Mountain, 70 km from Ternopol.
The first history of this is from the beginning of the 13th century.

The worldly lioness posted another sad post at Instagram, making her followers mad.
"Never thought that feelings could have a price.
Life is still teaching me... and when I start to learn about people, "smart Buzova.
A lot of fans reacted to this post and noted that in fact, "the real life has not been seen."
"You're the one who hasn't suffered yet.
You stick to every word, live in a normal, normal family," writes @nataliamama37.
There were also those who advised Busova to go to a psychologist or at least to read a book on the subject.
"Maybe you should read a book on psychology.
What do you have to do to avoid being a victim?" @liashukgalina.
However, there were some who supported the singer.

Your man won't say a big word all over the country and then just don't do it," he backed up to Bouzova @arina_prostyle.

If we keep playing the same thing right, the victories will come.
Chief Coach of the Moscow "Dinamo" by Vladimir Vorobiev on the fall from the "Automobilist" (0:1) in the regular CHL match.
"Good game was, interesting though it was going to go to the hollow," quotes Sparrow's official website, "The Automobilist."
"We used to play very easy.
I really liked the first period.
We didn't use a few good moments.
In the second period, we got a bit stifled, we survived.
But we've been "fed" a bit.
The guys played well, they did the coaching setup.
I think if we keep playing the right game, we'll win.
They didn't win, but the game was the right thing to do.
Good luck will come if we keep playing in this direction."
"In your opinion, the Automobilist has added more than the meeting in Lower Novgorod?"
"Then the foreign side didn't play.
At the pre-season, the crews were doing other things, playing a lot of young guys.
I think it was a completely different game, another hockey game.
Automobilist is a good team.
It's clear from the tournament table that the team is playing the right game.
Good hockey, good atmosphere in the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them good luck.
The command is moving in the right direction.
A lot of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good goalie.
It was hard, we were getting ready.
We knew the team was on the move, we wanted to break it, but it didn't work out."
Every inhabitant of Kalmakia is a debtor
The people of the Republic are increasingly visiting the official Internet site of the Federal Service of the Russian Courts Department for the Republic of Korea.
In the past eight months, more than 140,000 visits to the site have been recorded, and more than 42,000 have been downloaded from the “Executive Business Data Bank” section.
According to the President of the Public Council of the UFSSP of Russia for the RC Valeria Bogdanov, almost every inhabitant of the region is liable for public charges, GIEACPC fines, bank loans, loans, and no one is immune to contingencies.
But debtors can have negative consequences in the form of, for example, a ban on going abroad.
For this reason, the Russian Federal Service for the Republic of Korea recommends that all who have planned to travel abroad should specify and settle the outstanding debts at the local bailiffs office or at www.r08fsprus.ru.
The Service has set up an “Employment Data Bank” for the convenience of citizens.
This special electronic application is not only available on the regional UFSSP sites of Russia, but also on the social media and mobile media iPad, iPhone and smartphone.
The databank contains information on the execution proceedings instituted by the Kelmian bailiffs against all the debtors - explains the assistant head of the Russian FESSP for RC Delgir Bodgayev.
“In the event of arrears, the system displays information on the number and date of the initiation of the enforcement proceedings; the name of the body issuing the executive sheet or other act; the number, amount and type of debt; the address of the bailiff ' s office; the PFI of the bailiff; and the contact phone.
Information on the status of the execution can also be found on the Public Service Portal at: http://epgu.gosuslugi.ru"

Chief Macedonian opponent refused to vote in a referendum
In Macedonia, a referendum on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia is taking place on Sunday, 30 September.
Citizens are asked to answer one question, "Do you support EU and NATO membership by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
However, the leader of the leading opposition party, the “Inner Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, the Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity” (WMRO-DPMNE), Christian Mitzkoi stated that he would not vote in a referendum.
As the party's press secretary, Nahum Stoilkovsky, explained, Mitzkoski decided to abstain from the vote in order to express his opposition to a treaty that he considered to be “bad”.
According to the Spokesman, the current referendum addresses the issue of renaming the country, and nothing more, while the party’s strategic goal is to gain membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, the President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, refused to take part in the referendum on 30 September.
He explained that he had chosen a name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader viewed the country ' s renaming as a negative factor.
"A new semi-sovereign State is being created with a new name," noted Ivanov.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic, the Republic of Northern Macedonia, was signed on 17 June this year by the heads of the Macedonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Greece at a solemn ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, which runs the border between the two countries.
This treaty should resolve a long-term dispute about the name of the country, as well as Skopje's journey to NATO and the EU, like the TASS.

In the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, however, only two Czech tourists have been injured.
According to the Department of Public Information, the victim has 35% of her body burns and 15% of her male body burns, and writes "RIA News."
This is a second-degree fire, and a woman with a deep infiltration into her skin structure.
The Turkish cook, Nusret Gekce, is known on the Internet for his elegant way of spiceing steaks with salt and spices.
He was reported to have ordered a massive PR-campagne in various countries, where Leonardo DiCaprio visited Nusreta's restaurant in Dubai.
On 1 April, a fire broke out in the old barn in Kazan.

EU has allocated Y1.5 million to help the victims in Indonesia
The European Union (EU) has allocated Y1.5 million to Indonesia to deal with the effects of the earthquake and the tsunami.
This was reported by the European Commission press service on 30 September.
In order to monitor the provision of assistance, the European Commission has sent experts to the region.
It is noted that the funds will be used for disinfecting the victims, as well as for providing food, water, shelter and medicine.
The commission also provided the Indonesian authorities with access to the European Emergency Service (Copernicus) satellite maps to assess the damage.

It is also reported that the U.S. Department in Indonesia has not received any reports of American citizens who have been injured.

The US is setting up an upsurge in the production of opiates in Afghanistan
The sharpening of the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September has been a subject of much talk in Teheran.
There was a multi-stakeholder consultation with Iran, China, India, Afghanistan, and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nikolai Patrouchev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, the militants have waged a real terrorist war against the State authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year has been a record year in the number of blood attacks that have led to the death of thousands of ordinary Afghans,” said Patrouchev.
Afghanistan's troubles didn't start yesterday.
After the attacks of 11 September 2001, the Al-Qa'idah terrorist group (prohibited in the Russian Federation) was declared to be the main enemy of the United States.
Within a month, America and NATO allies began a military operation there, "Indestructible Freedom."
It's been 17 years.
The multi-thousand American contingent is still on Afghan land.
And a peaceful life is even more phantom than it was then.
The American troops are behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As far as they can, they pay off the militants for the money, so they don't get touched.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40 per cent, according to Patrouchev.
50 per cent in the Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
10 per cent more for ISIL terrorists (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they grow up there fast.
The aim is to create a barbaric pseudo-chaliphate in Central Asia, exactly what they failed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be okay with this.
As well, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40fold in the 17 years of the American presence.
Huge growth in the area, sown with opium macabre and multi-billion-dollar profits.
The Macedonians are preparing to vote in the EU and NATO accession referenda, subject to a change in the name of the country.
An agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with a neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbour to be called Macedonia, seeing in that name an attempt on the same Greek province and history.
Lupko Petkowski, politicologist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia has the right to a better future, the hope of social change.
And Greece will secure the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult trade-offs that cannot make everyone very happy."
The country is renamed by the ruling social demokrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zayev.
Conservative opposition and President George Ivanov are against.
In the opinion of the journalist Clementin Chilimanov, Macedonia has no point in joining the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it: “Many of those who do not like the agreement think that the current socialist government, led by Zayiv, is being imposed from outside to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
It is clear that there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Faye Dulgary, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the greatest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice made by the citizens of Macedonia will determine the future not only of the Balkan, but of Europe as a whole."
The Minfine of the Russian Federation foresaw the course of the rouble for 17 years in advance.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia is looking forward to a gradual weakening of the roubles, up to 73.9 roubles per dollar by 2031-2035, following a draft long-term budget forecast made to the State in conjunction with a federal budget project.
In 2021-2025, the rate of rubles is projected to be 66.4 roubles per dollar, 71.1 roubles in 2026-2030, and 73.9 roubles in the next five years.
The Agency notes that the figures are nominal.
The real effective rate (an index that takes into account the exchange rate changes of the major trading partners of the Russian Federation) will remain stable, is assured by officials.
In the case of inflation, it will be 3.5 per cent before 2020, and then stabilized at about 4 per cent, in Minfin.
