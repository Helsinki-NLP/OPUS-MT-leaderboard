The social map of the Ivanov Region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the continuation of the public passenger transport allowance.
Since 24 September, there has been a change in the way in which citizens are organized with the social map of the Ivanov Region.
According to the press service, the Government of the Russian Federation in Ivanovsk oblast reports that the changes provide for the maintenance of the right to travel in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of social map calculations into line with the requirements of Federal Act No. 161 of the Federal Act on the National Payment System.
At the same time, the social map of the Ivanov Region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application have changed.
For example, the replenishment limit is no longer set for travel, as it used to be, but for money, with winter and summer periods of not more than 400 roubles in winter, and not more than 800 roubles in the summer period for the current month.
Now, social card holders on transport receipts will have to track the cash balance rather than the number of remaining trips.
The cost of favourable travel for citizens would be 1/2 of the rate in effect for the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed for the regional budget.
The schedule for the social map is the same, from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new mode of travel on the social map will have a number of advantages.
For example, it is possible to keep a detailed account of the expenditure on the social map to the point of the kopeques.
In addition, there is the possibility of the return of the sums of cash that have been credited but have been unexpended.
Let us also add that the scheme of payments with the carriers is becoming transparent, as now half the cost of the journey is paid by the national, and the same amount is paid to the carrier for the budget.
No commission will be charged when the money is put on the map.
In turn, Vasili Silkin, Deputy Head of the Ivanov Road and Transport Department, reported that more than 33 million social map trips were made in the region in 2014, and almost 25 million in 2015.
More than 470 million roubles are included in the regional budget for the provision of the social map-free travel of citizens.
As at 1 September, the amount for this purpose was over 312 million roubles.
At the time of the 911 call, the teacher will confess to the murder of a friend.
At the time of the 911 call, a schoolteacher named Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and needed staff to come to their home.
Lamb stressed that there was a dog in the house who was alive, but probably upset, and said that the family of the deceased could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note, negligently written on a white sheet of linted paper, saying, "I'm so sorry, I'd like to get it all back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," the note, according to the authorities that Lamb signed.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who was conducting two online classes at the University of Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, had been able to go 300 miles to a university campus, where the police think he shot all the esteemed history teacher Ethan Schmidt on the doorstep of his office.
The Chief of Police at Delta University, Lynn Baford, reported that the university officials found out about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb had made the true call to 911 shortly after.
By the end of the day, there will be one more victim: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced the students and the teachers to hide behind the locked doors, the authorities still tried to add to one picture the motives behind Lamba.
The information shared by the investigators in both parts of the state, as well as by the students and the staff who knew him, helped to draw up a picture of a talented but possibly concerned teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gauthia, where Prentiss died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he expressed his appreciation to the “pretty people” he was in touch with in his teaching life.
Both of them taught at the Department of Social Science and History, which has 17 teachers, and many of the students attended both.
At the same time, there were some preconditions for problems.
A student who spoke well about Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed alarmed and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb had told him at the end of the school year 2014-15 about how he was dealing with stress.
Lamb previously asked the University of Delta to give him sick leave, saying he was in some kind of health problem.
This year, he was only in two online classes.
The recent changes in the university rules for admission to work meant that the doctor ' s degree, which Lamb worked so hard to obtain, would not guarantee him an automatic post of teacher.
University President William Laforge said he didn't know anything about the Lamb-Schmidt conflict, but "apparently, Mr. Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
The police attacked Lamb after his escape from campus when he was on his way back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38 caliber detonation gun in the backyard of his home, one mile south of his parents' home in Greenville, Mississippi, and told the coroner of Washington Metel Johnson County.
His motor car was still on the driveway.
It was not clear why Lamb had come to the house, even though, according to Johnson, she thought he knew the people in it.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at a university with 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and education.
He won a PhD in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and funny man.
Carla Harston told me she was 15 years old, and Lambu was 20 years old when they met through common friends.
She and her friends went to high school, and he was a cool older guy who for years tried to teach her how to play a guitar.
In those years, it was a success for women.
All the girls hid when he was around," says Hareston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss must have met for a while.
At the time of the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there's no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gothiea in a brick house, the back of which goes to the canal.
According to the police, the dog's okay.
Princes' ex-husband, Sean O'Stine, reported that they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had been friends, and that they had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She's very depressed," said O'Stine about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stine said he didn't meet Lamb, but he heard from his daughter, Abigail, that Lamb was interested in music and was playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at the concerts.
O'Stin told me his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaeffer, a bartender and, on the same day, a facilitator of entertaining programs in a gloomy-lighted bar in Gothier's suburbs, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing the guitar and the harmonic harmonica for a few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We used to have fun and make fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, a dead teacher, held freshman seminars and specialized in the history of native Americans and colonized America, told Don Allan Mitchell, an English-language teacher at the same school.
He was married and he had three little kids.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was the president of the student fraternity and student self-governance.
At the University of Delta University campus in Cleveland, on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university professors, staff, students, and members of the community, took part in a memorial candle-lighting ceremony.
His wife, Liz, and his brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang the Bright Morning Star and the Amazing Grace.
The classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforge.
The crisis is over.
It's a day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was prepared by Emily Wagster Pettus, as well as by Rebecca Santana, in New Orleans, in Greenville.
The material was edited in response to a statement by the police that Lamb's call to the 911 service after the murder of Schmidt, and that even though Lamb spoke of his wife as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was unconfirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire less staff for the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that he will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as he did last year, with a toy and toy reteller for children, and he assures him that he will give regular and temporary staff more hours to work.
The company states that it is planning to hire 40,000 people to work at shops and shops throughout the country, which is less than the 45,000 who have been hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company has indicated that it will start interviewing the applicants this month and will increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although it is a few months before the holidays, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are getting ready to hire temporary employees to have enough staff in shops and to sell, send and deliver the goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Rear to the Future" was a big event for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We've been in the cinema waiting for the royal family to arrive, I've noticed that the place next to me is free, and it hit me - the Princess Diana will be next to me," he said in the trailer by the soon-on-screen documentary "Rear in Time."
The movie's starting, and it comes to my mind that I'm literally at a distance of my arm and in one false yawn from dating the Princess of Wales.
"Rear in time" - a documentary on "Rear to the Future" - includes an interview with Fox, Leah Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as the director Robert Zemekis and Executive Producer Stephen Spielberg.
The film, "Rear to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spielberg, "it is the greatest time-travel movie ever made."
"Rear in time" will be available on VOD, DVD, and in some cinemas in October.
The head of the United Nations states that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in response to Russia's military support for Syria, states that there is no “war solution” for a near-five-year conflict, and an increase in arms will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN head again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations in order to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon stated at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the differences in the council, as well as among the Syrians and local authorities, had “made the situation insurmountable”.
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they had shown in dealing with the issue of Iran ' s nuclear programme and in dealing with the Syrian crisis.
8 polls that show that Donald Trump is not joking.
Some tried to label him a provocateur.
The others flung it off, taking it as a joke.
And some people want a scandal.
But no matter how hard some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's high position in the polls, they've failed (for the moment).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown the advantage of Donald Trump in two-digit numbers, and some are starting to ask seriously what this means to a real estate magnate in terms of the chances of being nominated.
Of course, this is just the start of the electoral cycle.
None of this means Trump has a chance to nominate the Republican Party.
The experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry gave up his popularity to Herman Kane, none of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there's a lot of reasons why he'd be fighting in the general election.
But external groups, such as the "Policy Activism Super-Committee" of Jeb Bush, and the economic conservative group of the "Growth Club" recognize the unrelenting power of Trump and begin to get their dollars to overturn it.
Here are some of the polls that tell us that a real estate magnate is not just an intermediate phase:
Trump's sympathy ratings went 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University revealed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive view of this real estate magnate.
By mid-July, it was 40%.
In early August, it was 52 per cent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these are in the initial stages.
A quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of the Republicans there were positive with Trump.
Two-thirds of those who voted for the GOP would have Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said that they were either “joyful” or “satisfied” if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of ten say they'd be "dissatisfied" if he'd become a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they'd be "excited" against 40% of those who say the same thing about Trump).
Next to the level of joy?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republicans say that they will be "unsatisfied" or "dissatisfied" if Jeb W. Bush's student favor is a candidate.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temperament is a problem.
While Trump has been widely criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 per cent of the national voters think that the Magnatus has the right temperament to be president, as the ABC News/Washington Post poll on Monday showed.
The same figure appears at the country's first closed assembly in Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of the Republicans think he has the same person who can be the main commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44% think he's not the man who can be effective in office, and almost six out of 10 independents say his temper is not the right thing to do for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to it.
When they put on their know-how hats, the Republican voters think Trump's a big deal.
On the question of who is the most likely winner of the GOP nomination, four out of ten said Trump was the favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of ten bets on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: The voters of the GOP have not previously had the right magic crystal.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four of the 10 Republicans selected Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported a possible Mitt Romney.
Still, this shows that a lot of GOP voters think Trump's campaign is persuasive.
Even if the Republicans were to unite around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that such a dispersion is likely to have the advantage of Trump, while those who do not support Trump are evenly distributed among the supporters of more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in the hypothetical one-to-one competition between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump has almost always received the support of the majority.
It is 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorine, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush 19 points ahead, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, and Chris Christie 33 points ahead.
He's got a tie with Ted Cruise.
The only candidate who's around him?
Ben Carson overcame a businessman at 19 points in a hypothetical one-to-one competition.
A little over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their mind.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have confidence in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46% say they leave the door open to other candidates.
Still, Trump's hardest competition at the moment is with an outsourcer co-worker, Ben Carson, but the voters who say they've changed their mind are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called the Mexican immigrants “rape” two months ago in his campaign-opening talk, the topic of immigration has become the most relevant in the conversations in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s glimpse will turn key Latin American voters away from the Republican Party and hinder rebranding.
But according to the ABC/Post poll on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So as long as immigration attracts everyone's attention, it seems that Donald Trump will stay in the same position.
The Government's disillusionment is gaining new ground.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on the support of about half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their outside status.
Six of the 10 Republicans on Monday's new ABC/Post polls say they want a political outsider rather than a man with government experience.
And they're also offended by Washington.
A survey of Des Moins Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are dissatisfied with the work of the Republicans in Congress, with 54% "unsatisfied" and 21% "in anger."
The government will decide on the fate of the pension index in October.
The vice-premier of the Russian Federation, Olga Hungerec, said that the Government was currently looking for options to implement the 2016 Pension Indexation Act to the real inflation rate, and was handing it over to the WG.
It noted that a solution was to be found by 8 October, by the time the next year ' s draft budget was submitted to the Government.
In addition, Kabmin is discussing the option of extending the decision to freeze the accumulated pension to Russians.
The hungry noted that the sum of the pension savings is 350 billion roubles.
The cost of indexing the full pension in the following year is about the same.
According to the vice-premier, there is not yet a final decision as to who should pay for the non-working citizens.
The hungerr is of the view that if a person is not working on his or her own initiative and is not treated as a socially vulnerable category, it is not entirely fair that a society pays for it.
In the past, the media have reported that two options for balancing the state budget are being considered in Kabmin.
Why are the eyelids often irritated and reddish?
The optalmologist Tatiana Levasov responds:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that lie on them.
By forgetting to clean up a regular age, we have often contributed to the development of the blaze.
Quit simple:
Do not tremble your eyes with your filthy hands, and wear a special wet napkin for the eyelid;
at least 1-2 times a day, clean up the edges of the century from the harmful substances stored in them in the day.
Cleaning up cleansing procedures should also be supplemented with warm compresses with herbs (salves, chamomiles) that dilute the dense secret of the saline glands, and then massage the edges of the age, which should be carried out by round motions of the fingertips;
Wash your make-up, don't use alcohol.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and add to the clot of the saline gland.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nukes have created a nuclear warhead.
The North Korean authorities have reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the Yongben nuclear complex, is running "at full capacity."
The report was made available on the country's Central Telegraph Agency's website.
It is noted that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is ready to respond at any time to the “U.S. aggression and nuclear threat” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “by quantity and quality”.
The North Korean authorities conducted the last test of nuclear weapons in 2013.
However, no plans have been made to resume the full operation of the reactor since then.
Pyongyang claims he managed to make a nuclear warhead.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has also tested medium- and short-range missiles on several occasions, writing politic.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded that the reference to the brotherly peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
The leader of LDPR, Wladimir Zhirinowski, believes that the reference to the association of brotherly peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said this during the State Duma meeting, he informs the Russian News Service.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletics can't stand," said Girinovsky.
The MP is of the view that all four-points, which contain this line, need to be removed:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinowski stated that the current anthem needed to be changed to "God save the king" and the Russian tricolour replaced by an imperial flag, writing politic.ru.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad has called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe is to deal with the problem of refugees, it must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not what Europe accepts or does not receive refugees, but what is needed is to address the root causes of the problem.
If Europeans care about the fate of the refugees, let them stop supporting the terrorists.
That is our view on this issue.
"That's the point of the question of refugees," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to reach a consensus.
But if we want real success, it is not possible as long as people die, as long as the bloodshed continues, and as long as the people do not feel completely secure.
“So we can reach a consensus, but we can't do anything until we win terrorism in Syria,” Assad stressed.
Let us recall that some 500,000 migrants, including from Syria, have come to the European Union in the course of this year.
The European Commission has stated that the current global migration crisis has been the largest since the Second World War.
It may be that thousands of militants of the extremist group the Islamic State may be among the migrants who come to Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization that is banned in Russia can use the situation to set up their cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The people of the German city have set up a holiday for the refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become a leader in the reception of refugees, although it has recently strengthened border control to keep them off the run.
The authorities estimate that about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of the year, although some experts refer to a much higher number.
More than 90,000 refugees have already arrived since the beginning of September.
A BBC correspondent, Jenny Hill, visited Darmstadt, a city with a very warm welcome for migrants.
Jeremy Corbin debuts on the Prime Minister's question session.
After the election of Mr. Corbin, his debut at the question-and-answer session is expected to the Prime Minister very much
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, is about to address the Prime Minister for the first time, with the first time in the way of David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will address the first of the six issues in the afternoon; the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party are likely to follow his presentation closely.
He made a call for “lower theatre and more facts” in a weekly demonstration.
He also stated that he could miss some of the meetings, leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbin ' s first parliamentary test as head; it will take place after his appointment of a shadow office and his address at the annual Treadunion Congress on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the leader to stand silent during the performance of the national anthem on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the British War, led to criticism by a number of conservative members of Parliament, and became the subject of a number of headlines in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
The Spokesman, Mr. Corbin, stated that he was “staying in respectable silence” and recognized“ the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain”.
However, Mr. Corbin's shadow office member Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would have advised the leader of the laborers to sing the national anthem “indistinctly” from his belief in the need to end the monarchy.
Almost a dozen Shadow Ministers refused to play on Mr. Corbin's team, expressing their differences on economic, defence and international policy, while less than one-six members of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC Policy Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences will also “continue in a stack” in the Labour Party after Mr. Corbin has been appointed to the European Union and the Government has restricted compensation.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Treadunion conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at eliminating the very idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Shadow Minister of Labor and Pensions, stated that the party had a “full clarity” on the fact that it had been in opposition only to the Government's plans to cut the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the Laborists to meet David Cameron at the "courier box" in the last 10 years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, states that he has “involved the collective resources” to get Mr. Cameron's ideas and has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
A member of Parliament from the Ailington North County stated that the Prime Minister's issues were causing an excess of confrontation, and that he would also refrain from the witty answers and the exchange of thorns, instead promising to focus on serious issues, such as poverty, inequality and the problems that young people face.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Economy in the Shadow Office, would replace him with the Prime Minister when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also expressed the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor if possible, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercoe, to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to get away from the political style of the “negligent Balagan,” often associated with the process of questions to the Prime Minister, but he acknowledged a few years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's questions have become a key indicator of the leader's views, their ability to run the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, even though critics claim that this has become a caricature and requires major reforms.

Pound sterling grows as the British wage rises
The pound has grown against the background of the increase in British wages, with the FTSE 100 index rising as a result of an offer to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, British earnings, less bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent over the same period last year.
The rate of growth has been the highest since 2009 and has been met as an earlier rescheduling of the forecasts for possible increases.
The pound sterling rose by more than 1% in relation to the dollar, to $1.505, and by 0.84% in relation to the euro, to i.e. 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229,21 by 1.49%.
On the other hand, SABMiller shares rose by 20 per cent as a result of an AB InBev’s purchase offer.
The deal would bring together the two largest brewery companies in the world, putting together brands such as the Budweiser, Stella Artoys, Peroni, and Grollsch.
Burbery stock grew by 0.9%, with encouraging news from a rival group of suite-grade producers, Richemont.
The latest sales data for Richemont outperformed all the expectations and showed that China's sales - on the key market for Burberry - have begun to grow again.
Glencore stock rose by 5 per cent after a mining giant announced that it had been able to earn $2.5 billion through stock-laying as part of a debt-reducing strategy.
The mondi's stock of paper and packing group was leading the drop in the index by 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs lowered the group's rating to "sell".
The JD Sports stock rose after the sporting apparel company reported an 83% increase in pre-tax profits to £46.6 million in six months.
Chief JD Sports says that higher wages can hinder expansion
The Executive Director of JD Sports, Peter Cougil, says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that such a purchasing power will overstate the cost of work, he says.
The cost could have affected plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could have meant a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a bottom-up campaign to combat Aldi push
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA shops from Aldi pressure in South Australia and Western Australia.
A bottom-up global food supplier launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA Ritters in South Australia and Western Australia, in the light of the forthcoming infusion of Aldi 700 million dollars.
While Aldi is preparing to open two warehouses and the first of the 120 shops in South and West Australia early next year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relations with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and on "Adelaide Show"-type events.
The campaign is supported by retailers and IGA suppliers, such as the manufacturer of the Simmo's ice cream from Dunsboro, who offers a taste in IGA shops, and shopkeepers who sell tickets to the South Australia Football League with a discount.
Metcash is expected to provide more details on its protection strategy on September 29, the day that this bulk supplier of food, liquor and household goods will be spending its annual investor strategy day.
In South Australia and Western Australia, shops with an IGA brand account for almost 30 per cent of all Metcash shops and show a higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the Eastern States.
Buyers in South and West Australia are known to be adhering to the usual routes, so the market is more favorable to IGA retellers than in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA, as compared to about 14 per cent in the Eastern States.
Analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe, however, that Aldi will take out 5% of the food market in the two states within 12 months of the opening of their first shops, taking out the volume of sales from all the players present, but mostly from independent retellers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an Analyst of Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA Ritters can lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The prognosis is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in SA and 30 in WA next year, selling 500 million and 600 million dollars in these markets, respectively.
Loss of income and sales of food at high constant cost Metcash may cost the company about 13 million pre-paying interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat believes.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly due to Aldi and the Colles, and a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
In Morgan Stanley, it is estimated that Metcash food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017, and by 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglas's senior stock manager, the founder of the Madellan Financial Group, noticed at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "could be very likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to make a public comment on Mr. Douglas's comments.
But it is assumed that a Member of the Board of Directors of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The share of IGA in the market has fallen from 18 to 14 per cent since 2010, and Metcash's income from the food business, which the company supplies to some 1,200 IGA Ritters, has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 as a result of the operational debriefing and the pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million a year to equalize retail prices with those of coles and Woolworths for a thousand items per week, and helping IGA Ritters to remodel outlets, as well as offering a fast-growing range of fresh foods and a wider choice of branded foods.
Metcash Director-General Ian Morris said that the price-equivalent and remodeling of the trade space was on the rise, and he hoped that the company would make an increase in the net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanashi Kokkinakis is supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Tanashi Kokkinakis deserves to be honored, not criticized for his behavior.
Tanashi Kokkinakis has been indirectly affected by the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more credit for his behavior than the critics, according to President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in a talented duo and often called "Special Ks", was involuntarily the focus of attention due to Kiryos' shameful confrontation with Stan Vaurinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly after, during a hot Cincinnati qualifying match, the judge at the tower had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, and Harrison said, "The wurm was to be put on Kiryos' spades, and I have to put it on this guy's scapula."
Since Kokkinakis was last seen cracking a racket after a cramp in his leg saved Richard Gasque from a possible US Open defeat, Healy loyally defends Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grot for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomich in a single state in the semi-final Davis Cup v. Britain.
"I'm very worried about one thing, namely, that Tanashi got involved in a conflict," said Healy.
He really broke the racket when he got his leg on US Open, but he's not the first player to break the racket when hope fell, and I know Tanashi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he's been very good in pretty provocative US situations, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he's a trustworthy man.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a bit unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he's a hard-working, he's a good fit for the team, he's never had a problem with other players, he's got a lot of respect outside the court, he's in an excellent form, he's a very focused and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match, starting on Friday, believing that "mutual consent" was the right way out for everyone, but counting on a guy from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term player.
"Before all, we want the team to focus completely on the match, not the argument around [Kirios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick has gained power very fast, as people like Federer and Murray prove, he's growing up in front of the public, he's made a number of serious mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary to get him out of focus for a while so he can think about them, and that's the best for the team and the best for him.
Migration Crisis in Europe: Hungary declares an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
After announcing a state of emergency, on Tuesday, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on the southern border and detained those who were trying to infiltrate the country illegally in order to contain the flow of migrants.
On the border, there had been unrest, with hundreds of migrants congregating on the border, on which the Serbian authorities had reacted sharply.
Delayed for an indefinite period on the road between the border crossings of two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their home country broke up their tents and settled in the area.
But the discontent was on the rise.
When a police helicopter circled over them, the migrants yelled, "Open the border!" and yelled at the Hungarian Special Police.
Some objected to food and water.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia has declared “inadmissible” the return of migrants from Hungary, when more and more of them come from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not a collateral damage.
There is a need to negotiate with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,” said Ivica Dačić in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serb border began the day after a bloc of 28 countries was unable to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to take common responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that an agreement would be reached in the future (in the next month or by the end of the year) whereby EU member States would receive an additional 120,000 refugees, including those from Hungary.
German chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a European Union emergency summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis affecting the continent.
Hungary, however, did not expect any quick action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in the two southern regions has given the authorities more authority to deal with the crisis, which has enabled them to block the roads and speed up the asylum proceedings.
In the meantime, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Siyarto, has stated that his country is also planning to erect a barbed wire fence on the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has completed the fence on the Serb border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even the inmates had been involved in an urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “bottom line” and border crossing point for the European Union for the displaced, many of whom are refugees who are the victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Victor Orban insists that most of the people who come to the country are economic migrants seeking a better life than refugees who are the victims of the wars that are entitled to protection, and this view is in stark contrast to the views of other EU countries, Germany.
The new laws in force in Hungary at midnight now make it an offence to cross or damage a four-metre (13-foot) barbed wire fence constructed by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison terms for the accused of human trafficking.
“Because of a situation of mass migration, the Hungarian Government has declared a state of emergency,” said a government agent, Zoltan Kovac, in the south city of Seged.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, Parliament still has to authorize the deployment of the military force, which is expected next week, but the reporters of the Assocated Press, who are at the border, have been watching the presence of armed men with vehicles and dogs for a few days.
Diardi Bacondi, Orban's national security adviser, reported that 45 persons who tried to cross the border on the border had been apprehended by the authorised authorities, while another 15 had been in the country.
They have crossed the border by breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are charged with administrative offences under the new laws.
The authorities are fast fixing the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passages on Tuesday morning on the border with Serbia, putting a barbed-wire rail car to block one of the passages.
The riots erupted on the main pass across the border near the city of Riosque, Hungary, as the Hungarians set up a service space to pass people inside a metal container, and crowds pressed each other to break in.
Some 20 people have been able to penetrate, and thousands of people have been left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway from Serbia to Hungary and announced a ban on food and water until they were allowed to go to Hungary.
2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders has been halved in a national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit advantage in the Democratics race for nominating all over the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now has support of 47 per cent of the primary democratic voters (down from 58 per cent), and Sanders is the second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to take part in the presidential race, has received the support of 15 per cent of the prime democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the competition in the primary elections, most Democrats say that it is too early to say that they have decided on a candidate to be supported.
Clinton’s supporters are more confident of their choice than supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost support to some population groups, and Sanders has been getting some bonuses.
Clinton has a great advantage among women and moderates, but this advantage has been reduced.
Her support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind her.
Clinton's preference for a 50-year-old Democrat is gone, and he and Sanders are now on the same page.
But Clinton still has a great advantage among the more senior voters.
Last month, Clinton overcame Sanders by two digits among the liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in this group.
Almost half of the primary democratic voters all over the country say that they would have been enthusiastically supportive of Clinton if she had become a candidate for this party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and a further 15 per cent would support it simply because it was a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
It may not be surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about it.
Among those who do not support Clinton at the moment, more divisive views – only about a quarter with enthusiasm would support it.
While 48 per cent of the prime-democracy voters say that they would cheer up for Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same thing about their leader, Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked outright why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16%), then that it is now the time of a woman president (13%), and that she is the best candidate for the post (10%).
Clinton's supporters also talk about an association that links her to Bill Clinton (9%).
It's also called agreement on the issues and the chances of being elected.
Since the Vice-President was considering the potential for participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the prime Democrats wanted him to join the race - though a third felt he should not.
When they are asked who they want to be second-ranked among the party's candidates, the prime-democracy voters are in most cases called Biden.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say they'd pick Biden second, it's more than Sanders'.
If Biden chooses not to stand for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of the Democratic voters see Clinton as the best candidate to win the general elections; however, this number has fallen from 78 per cent last month.
In this indicator, Biden is the second-largest one, but the percentage of those who think he's the most likely to be a candidate has increased.
However, in answer to the question of what is most important in a candidate, the Democrats choose other options than the chance of being elected.
Like last month, none of the candidates from the Democrats or potential candidates is an inadmissible candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some of the key features among the primary voters of their party.
Most think Clinton, Sanders, and Byden are honest and trustworthy people with good leadership.
Biden of all three is the leader in integrity, and Clinton's strength in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of the prime democratic voters do not think Clinton is fair and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have any opinion on it.
The prime democratic voters also generally view Clinton, Sanders, and Byden as similar.
By all of these standards, about a quarter of the Democratic Voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Although the questions about Hillary's personal mailbox and the Hillary Clinton server are still under way as her Secretary, most prime Democrats are satisfied with her explanation and feel that this has not adversely affected their general view of it.
But this is a very different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with her explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the debate about e-mail has not affected their general view of Clinton in any way, although 36 percent say that their view of it has deteriorated.
They're mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who say that their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is considered fair and trustworthy by her party, this continues to be a problem for her as a whole, with only 32 per cent considering it fair and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two per cent of the registered voters do not consider it fair and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not consider Trump to be fair and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, both have a good record of leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Byden, Carson, and Bush show the best in honesty.
Most people see Sanders as an honest man rather than an honest man, but, like Carson, a lot of people don't think about him.
The error limit for a sample of 351 prime-democracy voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the national poll, Ben Carson was very close to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson approached Donald Trump in a recent CBS/New York Times poll.
The two candidates won half the vote in the new poll, leaving the rest of them looking for support under their feet.
Voters from all over the country continue to support Trump, whose support rate rose from 23% in a recent CBS poll held on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27% in a Tuesday poll.
But Carson took off from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson was supported by all the population groups, persuading Trump in a group of Republican voters with a higher education.
The other candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and the Ohio Governor John Kasich, rolled back with the Governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Hackaby, and Florida Senator, Marco Rubio, together ranked third with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this recent poll is positive to minus 6 per cent, and the poll was conducted in September.
The recent CNN/ORC survey, published last week, showed Carson's growth in the polls - with support from 19% of the Republicans, behind Trump with 32% of the support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump was far ahead of Carson.
With Carson's growing support last week, Trump made a number of critical hits on a former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday at the time the Iowa campaign was shut down.
Five members of the fraternity are charged with the death of a first-year student at Baruch College.
About two years after the death of a college student during the rite of fraternity in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
"Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood from Baruch New York College brutally assaulted Jang "Michael" Deng during the rite of dedication in September 2013 and failed to bring him to the hospital on time, which led to his death," reported the police.
Officials say that a student with blindfolded eyes and a 30-pound sandpack behind his back was pushed a number of times while he was trying to reach his target, walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained about his headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood didn't call 911 when Deng blacked out, and they've been waiting an hour to get him to the hospital, talking to the police.
But they took the time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and get in touch with Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, to ask for advice, as Chief Chris Wagner told at the press conference.
"At this point, the members of the fraternity began to conceal their personal property, essentially putting the well-being of the fraternity above Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the postmortem report, Deng suffered a number of blunt head, torso, and hip injuries.
"A lot of families have been affected by the rites of fraternity, as at least one student dies during them every year since 1970," said Douglas Fayerberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The fraternities and their members must be held responsible, a step that is very important on the part of the authorities.
The jurors in Monroe County have opted for a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with raping a newcomer and collusion.
“We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has officially or informally authorized all of this, it is also hers,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College banned fraternity, and the national fraternity excluded the local office.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be an upturn in the rate, and the bulls' market will stumble, the bond returns will grow, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long it will be before the attack, and how long it will last.
More specifically, for the economy, history does not explain much about time.
The recession was just 11 months after the first rate hike and for a total of 86 months.
The hardness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
So the U.S. Central Bank administration is so insistent that investors should not focus on when they start to raise the stakes, but on how much it will take to adapt.
In fact, there are a lot of variables in the game.
After all, however, market participants may find that all the fuss about raising rates is overstated.
"The Federal Reserve's first rate hike, with a global financial crisis on its way, will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of `payable money'," said Julian Jessup, a major international economic expert in the Capital Economics, in his comments to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of US interest rates to a more normal, but still low levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy might have reacted, depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen in the last month or so, waiting for a rate hike can lead to a period of volatility.
If the rate is raised, however, the effects are usually less dramatic.
"It doesn't seem to slow down the stock revenues for 12 to 24 months after the first hike, which again probably reflects a delay in the monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the Federal Reserve rate hikes.
More specifically, in the last 35 years, the market has been more likely to move – about 14 per cent – upwards, and has remained relatively flat within 250 days (average growth of 2.6 per cent), and then, after 500 days, returns to normal conditions with an average return rate of 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the major trade strategy expert in Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends not to be more pronounced at the rate-growth stage, and stock revenue is beginning to fall.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they are often encouraged by higher rates.
In this case, the Federal Reserve has been placed under conditions that have not been in place before and can speed up the recession.
Most of the gross domestic product will be at its lowest point in the lifetime of the high rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases only twice the nominal annual GDP has been under 4.5 per cent of the rate up since 1950.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will last long, while it is only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlantic Fed.
The rise in rates on such a fragile economic background can be risky and raises the question, "will it be different this time," reported Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to raise the rate of the Federal Reserve for the whole year, with their view tied to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
So far, many strategy experts and economists believe that FOMC was able to approve the rate hike at this meeting, futures trade is only a 25-percent probability.
"In our study, from 1950, all the hikes of the rate up to now have been in a super-cycle of an ever-growing financial leverage at GDP that overcuts peaks precede the recession very fast after the start of the recovery," the report states.
In contrast, this was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest one the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession, a record of 35 months, which has lasted for 74 months, and is not over.
Fixed income has also become fragile, while the market is looking forward to rising rates, and this scenario is in a way similar to the one that is being marketed for shares.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds, the effect will be faster than for shares when the federal system changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it appears that the return changes the vector immediately after the first hike/down in the cycle.
At the end of the hike, the return on the bonds is falling immediately, reports Deutsche.
Policy experts in Charles Schwab believe that an increase in the rate of return will result in the return of long-term and short-term bonds getting closer, making the curve more flat.
High-return bonds are often better in such a climate, though "we're still afraid of the fluctuations in profitability," says a study by Cathy Jones, analyst of fixed income in Shwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected results of the federal system.
"In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflationary expectations, there are signs that the market has set itself up for a more strict monetary policy," she wrote.
The interest rate on short-term loans has risen, the rate of return has been more flat, the credit fronts have increased, and the volatility has increased - all market features, while the federal system has been tightened.
Generally speaking, companies that run a major business in the United States will benefit from an increase in interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with multiple debts will be in a worse position, as the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the world marketplace, and their debt is more expensive in financial terms.
"The history shows that `qualitative' shares are more effective than the market within three months of the initial rate hike," said Goldman Sachs analysts in the client report.
Firms with a stable financial position have been at an average of 5 percentage points per rate hike in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Firms with high capital return, as well as low-voltity equities, have also shown better performance than low-quality equities by an average of 4 (per cent) and 3 (per cent) respectively.
Duty will be a big question.
Companies with a high rate of debt with a floating rate will lose most, according to Goldman.
In addition to pure stock exchange, consumers will benefit from a growing dollar.
Investors could also see profit from higher returns, although experts differ in how fast this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 - a copy of the Classic FM", states the Conservative Member Andrew Bingham.
Member of Parliament from Conservatives, Andrew Bingham, criticized the station for "degrading standards"
Proves it's getting less and less different from a commercial competitor.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award was just erased from the Brits.
The parish collaborator, Damian Collins, who crashed on The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
"BBC Radio 3 is becoming a Classic FM," said the leader of the Parliament, motivating the radio company to prove that it is doing something that business companies do not do.
A member of Parliament from the conservatives, Andrew Bingham, also told the BBC leadership that it seemed as if the public radio station was "done" and was becoming less and less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like using the word "simplification" - but it seems to be turning into a Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, looks like The Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else -- here's two examples that came to my mind first, in which you're actually just copying what's already on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC Director General rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial rival when it comes to live music and the education of the audience.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his commitment to live performances and music can't be compared to anyone else.
"It's also very important, I think, the interest of Radio 3 in the search for new music and the promotion of new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey argued that the radio has to work a lot more to attract the audience than in the past, because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of BBC who was attacked for attacking the heels of commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A member of Parliament, Tori Damian Collins, attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that BBC bought from the Dutch Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed in the absence of originality and features?
Lord Hall states that the BBC 1 show, with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in the "BBC Typical Style".
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit in her own stable" the next time it was running a entertaining project.
But he does not think it necessary to block the ordering of new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of the money of those who pay the license fee for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales have slowed down as much as possible in August, and it could be Black Friday.
In the first three months of 2015, there was an increase of 7 per cent in online sales
Last month, there has been the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sales intensified three years ago with mobile shopping devices
The experts are convinced that November's Black Friday might have helped to contain the waste.
For about ten years, virtual shopping has been booming, transforming many central streets in Britain into phantom cities.
But experts say that there are now signs of levelling up online sales after the latest data show just a seven-per-cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total cost of online shopping in August has shown minimal growth since it began to be recorded in 2000, an increase of just five per cent.
Experts say that there are now signs of levelling up online sales after the latest data show only a 7 per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to 2000, they've always found a reasonable explanation," said the Guardian Andy Malkehi, the IMRG Sales Index editor.
He explained that online sales had intensified three years ago, when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do it under all conditions, like sitting on the sofa.
But now it's on the plateau, and you can see the decline.
The Black Friday fenomeen, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowing down of sales.
The experts believe that the buyers could have refrained from shopping on the eve of the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers hastened to the computers to take advantage of the lucrative bids, bringing down a number of vendor websites.
The experts think that Black Friday, when the buyers are in a real fight for lucrative purchases, could make people refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by British Real Consortum, a little more than £1 out of every 5 is spent online.
With regard to goods such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through Internet shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy their clothes and shoes online more than in fashion shops in central streets.
Moslems bury those who have been killed in the fall of a crane in Mecca, and the Bin Laden family has been subject to sanctions
Moslems carry the bodies of 29 dead in the streets, as the first funeral begins in Mecca.
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the street to bury 29 of the victims who had been killed by the crane in the main mosque of Mecca.
Dressed mostly in white, the ones present at the funeral swelled the carriageway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went on their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession passed by the holy place, where just a few days earlier, a crane had pierced the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parish.
The bodies were issued for the funeral, while the King of Saudis fined a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 parishioners who had been killed in a crane attack at the main mosque were on the street.
Among the dead was the father of four children, Kasim Akram, from Bolton, the Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell.
Mr. Akram was at the main mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left an arrow of the tap up when the crane was not running.
The Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press, states that the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English news agency did not report on this detail, but reported that the company's leaders were not allowed to leave the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the reason for the crane falling in the courtyard of the main mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have flown to go to the hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the crane’s collapse, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and of improper coordination with the Meteorological Service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Mecca main mosque, as part of the massive construction work being carried out by the Binladin Group.
The Bin Laden family has been one of Saudi Arabia's nearest ruling family for decades and has been running major construction projects.
The late al-Qa`idah leader Osama bin Laden was the son of a treacherous, whom the family disowned in the 1990s.
The accident took place with strong winds and rain just a few days before millions of people came to the Kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in a lifetime for every working Muslim.
Officials reported that there were 158 people in the hospital.
The officials ordered the payment of one million rials (about 174,000 pounds) to the deceased ' s relatives, and the same sum was irreversibly crippled.
The rest of the victims will receive half of this.
Chapter B&Q states that the trend is due to the presence of East European craftsmen working for a small sum of money.
According to Veronique Lori, the British are increasingly employing repairers.
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is on the rise
The result is to open more than 200 new Screwfix shops for professionals.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores all over the country
By Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent of the Daily Mail
They say the British put hammers and paint brushes aside, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do work in the house.
If you know how to use a hammer or how to paint a wall, you seem to be a minority today.
Because, according to the B&Q company, the British are still employing masters to do simple chores.
Veronique Lori, the new director-general of Kingfisher, who owns a network of house-study services, reported that this trend is followed by a significant inflow of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at a minimum cost.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open an additional 200 Screwfix shops specializing in craftsmen's products, while shutting down 60 B&Q shops.
Ms. Lori said that she wanted to see more women in B&Q shops, as eight out of 10 shopping decisions were made by women of the weak sex.
At present, most of the staff are men.
According to her, the recent demographic trends, with an increasing number of single-sex households, which were more active in their homes than in the past, could not be overlooked.
Mrs. Lori said, "Our shops are still dominated by men.
Steps must be taken to achieve a balance.
Overall, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on the items to be purchased are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of the five leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE 100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team to the same number of male and female directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which 50% of the managers are women, including the general and financial director.
Mrs. Lori said, "This was a deliberate decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
It was easy to find the right women on the board.
After the group took over the cost of shutting down the shops, Kingfisher showed a decline in profit and sales in six months.
As a result, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new shops.
Time to make a decision on the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching the Federal Reserve Bank's two-day meeting to discuss the most important decision, whether to raise the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists by Reuters found that just over half of those who thought last week that the Federal Reserve was going to do so now think it's going to wait and keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we approach the fact that the main bank can move from zero to start the process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The US economy is working well, the economic upturn adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
But the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should be prepared for change, but it was all about their belief that all the odds were against it.
The decision will be announced at 8:00 CET on Thursday.
A new Balkan route: the refugees go to the EU via Croatia.
"Open!" - hundreds of refugees at the Khorgos border crossing on the Serb-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border for the resettled.
The asylum-seeker is already beginning to test other routes to the European Union.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia, lies through Romania.
The other, through Croatia and Slovenia, to Austria.
According to some data, the buses that took the refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shidu on the Croatian border.
Drivers have been ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior, Nebojša Stepanovic, assures us that his country is doing everything in its power to help the refugees, but its capacity is limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help those people to be treated humanely.
But this is a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve, and no country in Europe alone can do it, much less a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But the Hungarian Premier Victor Orban is unfailing:
If a person is a refugee, in Serbia he must complete the necessary documents to do so.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed into our country, either, because it's safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already set up a 175-tilometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban has no intention of stopping it: he is planning to erect the same barrier on the border with Romania.
Boucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Evangelis Maymarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Evangelis Maymarakis has been a member of the right-wing central government for a number of years, which has led to a financial crisis in the left.
Now, as a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, he is challenging Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist, Euronews.
Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party was crushingly defeated by the SIRISA coalition, but now, according to the polls, New Democracy has been as popular as it is.
What has changed in that time?
Evangelis Maymarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsiprus lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a surplus in the budget and growth prospects.
The country is now again facing fiscal deficits and high levels of unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Ciprus had banished them.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had an opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare the promise with what really happened.
Day - to - day life has become much worse than in January, when the situation has improved, with the majority of Greek citizens.
But you say, if you win an election, you're gonna go for alliances with other parties, including SIRIS.
Evangelis Maymarakis: The fact is, as we have learned in recent years, that Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in place, the political forces and all the ruling parties have come together to implement a programme under which they have reached agreement without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If you become a new premiere on Monday, will you implement this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
We actually voted in favor of Greece's move on the European path, because we have a good idea of the disastrous consequences that a country's departure from the EU would have.
Now, Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, Juncker's package, and banking aid.
All of this would have been lost if there had not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures have been the result of Mr. Tsipras' negotiating.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
So, if Europe sees that the new Greek government in the first year of power is trying to put order in place, is acting rationally, and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all the commitments made, which cannot be met because of what leads to a recession, can be negotiated again, but only after a certain time.
It would be wrong to believe that, in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they look forward to the full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their trust, we must continue to privatize, reform and structural changes that have been agreed upon, while continuing to enjoy the benefits of EU financing and the greater investment opportunities we need to open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Tsipras has not put forward any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have learned by discussing with our European counterparts.
I can give you an example of the farmer's income.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, so it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We've been told that the ministers of Tsipras have never talked about it.
So the Greek ministers were unprepared and ill-informed, and so failed to negotiate and conclude a bad agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at one table with Mr. Juncker, Holland, Mrs. Merkel, and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them differ from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Evangelis Maymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that before the end of 2014, we tried to best implement the 2012 agreement, by bypassing the sharp angles in it.
We have been moving forward on reform.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extreme circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers ready to pay the price that the Greek government was making.
I was the Speaker of the Parliament at the time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups, the then government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key drafts, we had a working Parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as the mass demonstrations that took place outside.
And we have managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would have continued to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections that resulted from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: In recent weeks, a massive flow of refugees has been on Greek territory.
What do you think of this situation, and the reactions of the European countries to which these people are seeking?
Evangelis Maymarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we have to deal with after the election.
And the reason is that the Government of SIRISA has not acted in the way it should have.
In such matters, we have to be pre-emptive, for if the problem hits you, there are only emergency measures.
And that's what we're in now.
Even the interim government that replaced SIRIS has done more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras has done in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim Government, to which the President of the Republic, who called for an EU summit, has been of great help, will help to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and note that the refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that have taken place with them.
There is a profound humanitarian dimension to this issue, and we will follow the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
A decision must be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations must be involved.
We also need better coordination, better border control and reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance that the EU is getting to deal with this pressing problem.
Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Buddykovka Donetsk oblast, for 24 hours, the police of the Central Police Department of the Region, together with the military counter-intelligence, identified and detained a suspect who was found to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the city of Krivoy Rog, Dnepropetrov oblast, who was in the course of the evening of the joint use of liquor, and the conflict that erupted in the countryside of the Yasinovatsk district of Donetchina shot a gun at his opponent.
A 22-year-old boy was reportedly shot from a hospital where he was hospitalized with cross-fired legs.
As Artem Wasitsky, the Deputy Head of the Department of Criminal Investigation of the Police Chief of the Region, said, in the course of the operational actions, the law enforcement officers had proved to have been involved in another serious criminal offence, the killing of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The operatives found that the same day there was a conflict between the suspect and another local resident, resulting in a fatal gunshot wound to a man ' s head.
The Investigative Department of the Milkowski Gogo has opened criminal proceedings under the headings “Intentional murder” and “Intentional serious bodily harm” of the Criminal Code.
The detainee faces up to 15 years ' imprisonment.
The figure was detained and placed in a temporary detention cell, and was informed by the Donetsk police.
Two residents of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments in the color of the Ukrainian flag, including two monuments to Vladimir Lenin, have been sentenced to imprisonment by a Russian court.
Two more residents of the city had been sentenced to a restriction of their liberty.
Novosibirsk residents have been sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicts received a 14- and 18-month limit on their liberty.
The Leninsk Court of Novosibirsk found four citizens guilty of vandalism against Lenin Monuments, which were located on the territory of the CPRC and on the Street Trikotage, as well as the Monument of Glory Memorial.
In the latter case, the Katyusha and T-34 rockets were painted.
Remember, on the night of December 12 in Russia, in Novosibirsk, the unknown painted in the color of the Ukrainian flag military technology at the Monument of Glory.
The civil wife of the popular Russian actor Eugenius Zyganov, Irina Leonov, had a seventh child.
The girl was born in one of the Moscow clinics.
The newborn and her mom are doing well.
Let me remind you, Gypsies and Leonov recently broke up.
Eugenius refuses to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambition.
Eugenia Zyganov is 36 years old.
He's an actor in the Moscow Theatre of Peter Fomenco.
Familiar to the movies "A Walk", "Cosmos As a Premonition", "The Brest Fortress", "Ottepelle" and "Farza".
On September 8, Yevgeny Zyganov was recognized as "Acté des Jahres" and "Man of the Year" in the Russian version of the popular GQ magazine.
The man who shot at the University of Delta left a note of apology.
After the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his co-worker later on the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note that said he "repent" about the first murder and wanted to "return it all" - the authorities reported on Tuesday.
The police in Gotier, Mississippi, report that a professor of Geography and Social Science at the University of Delta called 911 about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the controller that the police needed to send people to his house.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there's a dog in the house who's "no one to touch," but he's probably upset.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but he didn't.
Lamb didn't explain why he fired.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a hand-written note from Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm sorry I'd like to get it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on the night of Monday, when he was surrounded by the police, he killed himself.
University rector William Laforge reported that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb was clearly on his mind."
Despite information on Monday that Lamb was supposed to have an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, the official services on Tuesday reported “the absence of any information or evidence” of a “loving triangle”.
Prentiss was referred to as a "good man" by Sean O'Stine, who said he was married to her for about seven years.
They got divorced 15 years ago, but they're still friends.
O'Stin told me he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter, and she was "conscious."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lyndsey Knowles, which the Sun Herald newspaper calls a close friend of Prentiss, the last one worked from home online.
Knowles told me that Prentiss had a hunter named Lightning, and that she was dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his family on Monday at some point to say "he's not going to jail."
On the night of the same day, when the police hit him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself.
According to a synopsis posted on the University's website, Lamb received a PhD in the field of pedagogic at the University of Delta in spring 2015.
Stars Losing Their Happiness
The actor (left), in a picture with his son, Redmond (right), has been through a number of difficult years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukaemia, and in 2009, he lost his multi-year life companion, Farrah Fosette, who died of cancer.
The actor was also reported to have been drug-absorbed, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this, of course, has played a role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United got out for a few months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a match at the League of Champions, where Manchester United lost PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about this, which will make it impossible to get out of the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during the rogue reprisal of Hector Moreno at the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV.
He was given help on the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaul said, "He's got a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be moved to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then he'll be operated on.
It's terrible - a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame a lot of difficulty and began to play fantastic, and that's when it happened.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double break, it's six months, and the guy can't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno's lucky he didn't get the red card and he didn't get the penalty.
The arbiter Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
You judge yourself when I say it's worth a penny and a red card.
It was a very bad two-legged stool.
In his Twitter account, Shaw writes, "Thank you all for your messages, not to describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I will return even more than I have been."
Also on the subject: Manchester United is having a misfortune with Luke Shaw in the PSV game.
The British defender will have an additional incentive to recover to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Coke, Coach PSV, said, "This is a very serious injury."
When any player gets out with this kind of trauma, everyone's very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to traumatize the opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team, led by Van Gal at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very hard for him right now, because he didn't have the intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious injury, you don't feel well," said Coke.
I didn't have a chance to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was a ball that was flying in the other direction, so it looked like it (Moreno) touched it, but I didn't see a pod like Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to bear it.
It's very hard for me, and I'm so sorry.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also taken to the hospital after a confrontation with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about the Lorakes?
Every parent is very quick to learn one thing: if your kid likes a book, it'll take a while to get to know it almost by heart.
Apparently, unless you're David Cameron.
In response to a question from a representative of a holiday-relief company about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister selected the Lorakes, an environmental fairy tale written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, and it was written by Cameron in a comment published on the SuperCamps website, and it goes on to say, "This is a funny, moving, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my kids, because it always reveals an image or a message we miss."
And all would be good, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to recount the content of the book, but he's actually talking about the same-name movie in 2012, with new characters and details added to make a rather short original narrative.
"In the high-walled city of Thundernawville, where there was no green, and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of audrey, the girls of her dreams, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," we read in the text a description of a love story unknown to Dr. Seuss (the real name is Theodore Sues Gazelle), who died in 1991.
If this does not seem suspicious enough, the text of Cameron is read almost as a summary of the film's "Lorakes", posted on Internet Movie Database: "In the high wall city of Thundernawville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of audre, the girl of his dream."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, as an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the content of a book in which an unnamed boy learns about how a greedy tree cutter and a "all-nothing" lodkins destroys the environment, despite the protests of Loraks (whose name is in the title of the book) - a funny thing with a mustache who "speaks on behalf of the tree."
It is likely that such a simple PR task has been assigned to an artist who has never read to a child a book about Lorax 20 times in a row.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text was allegedly from Cameron's office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments were received.
Adam Lit was clearly at risk of not joining England, but it's still a difficult question.
Winning Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England has selected for this tour, it's not possible to repeat the 3-0 test series that happened last time.
I wouldn't rule out a win in my field either.
The team of Alistair Cooke may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but it has players who are virtually using twisted balls, and collective thinking very much; they don't bring scars from 2012, but they're just a youthful positive.
With Moin Ali's ball, he turns into a bowler with twisted balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he's an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
On the subject: Adam Lit left England for a test cricket and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to expel Adam Lit to me, his main coach at Yorkshire, of course, is hard to analyse.
At his seven test match, it was two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the obvious, but brutal, reality is that cricket players are judged by the result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've said so before) the players choose themselves best.
A couple of semi-tones, and Lita might have been waiting for a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more shots for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The head coach in England, Trevor Bayliss, spoke well about his mood, even when he didn't show his way, and it doesn't surprise me; he's first of all a team player, and then everything else.
The question of how long it's gonna take before the test cricket batsman leaves an impression is a complex question.
Lit played seven games, just like Sam Robson played before, and Nick Compton played nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on another man's field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lit was in the best form, but this lost opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales is on the show, and he's a batsman I value high.
He's an unpredictable cricket player, which we saw at the Yorkshire Club earlier this season, when he earned 236 in a match against us at the Trent Bridge playground, which was something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those before him, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as a betsman to open up, which would make it possible to put in an extra spinner by keeping four fast-track bowlers, and I don't mind at all.
I don't see any reason why a hitter can't hit the ball there, and this left-handed guy has already shown that he's a hell of a cricket player.
Moan may not be exactly what he needs for his County of Woostershire, but he's become the third number for them, and there's no big difference.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test match "the third batsman" before he was released as a starter in 2001.
He won at once 300 and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari joins the team as a back-up spinner, and in my brief contact with him, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his model stats -- an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball -- and think it's a risky bet, but there's a small number of spinners who vote for it, and the choice of youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England is planning to make a number of practical additions to the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the test match, could be a mastery move.
He's one of the best guys for a game that's gonna bring in the wealth of experience that he's got under all possible conditions and any kind of attack.
Paul Collingwood is part of the game where the white ball is used, and will provide both the energy and the merciless pace in the set.
I've always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket, be it a game or a coaching job, and like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what was said earlier, can give new strength to the team.
Collie's collaborator for Durham Ben Stokes is left for a day, Ruth is given a similar break for Australia, and I, for example, have no problem with it.
Although not everyone will agree, coaches and pick-ups don't set a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The British exit camp can win if the economy is down by 2017.
David Cameron's misguided policy of resuming the negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU has become more and more difficult every day, even without looking back at the selection of the brilliant Jeremy- "Is it true or not?"- Corbin's a leader of the laborists, or TUC's resentment for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that, with the EU currently in a state of diverse crises - not all of them their own - some of the member countries are fed up with the British egocentric agenda of the sowing concessions and undermining the agreements of changes that they do not want in the main.
Having met in Brighton for an annual meeting, TUC decided that he didn't want it anyway if they were to ruin social protection.
We could even call it "the selfie program of Dave and George."
The prime minister and the minister of finance go to summit and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves against the background of a well-known local monument, a company of local celebrities, or without it, and then come home and say that they bring allies to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be interested in maintaining British external contacts under the EU Tent - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - proposes that the noisy ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they don't care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious German chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her office before the situation worsens for her, as it has worsened for the 11-year-old Thatcher, Mitterrand (14) and Kola (16).
The head of France, Francois Hollande, stands for re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland can soon get a right-wing nationalist government, and Spain can get a left-hand government.
It's hard to see them dripping out to help the sephi-brits whose energy could be used to prevent Scotland from getting out of the UK -- which they don't want, too, because most people have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers can even plan to hand out purposeless SNP-style remorse during the British referendum campaign in 2017 to support Britain's withdrawal from the EU, my friend suggests.
"Revision was an idea-fix" and "British didn't get any value from the resumed negotiations."
The Europeans know what kind of predator Fleet Street can be, and how sceptical media-magnets are vis-à-vis the EU, unlike Tony Ben's 1975 referendum, which supported our entry in 1973 by a ratio of 2:1.
They may bleakly remember Boris Johnson, a hardened Euro-opportunist, famous for his “direct EU bananas” by a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a small company of tax-hungering crooks, foreign phone hackers, and pseudo non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cell with a wild gorilla, you have to give her the bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with the tea.
In fact, Milliband was more committed to Blair than Blair himself to opposing Cameron's idea of a referendum, because Blair was in favor of the abrogated EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a win-win ticket.
The press never forgave him any of this.
But my dear Jeremy Corbin, who clapped me on the back in Westminster on Monday -- I told him he didn't have time to spend it on me -- he seems to risk repeating Neil Kinnock's "Bocott Murdock" strategy from the '80s -- a mistake both then and now.
It may take a while, but he has to develop a consistent strategy to interact with the press - not with me, but with Andrew Marr, on whose Air Force sofa he was on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is what I politely call evolution.
He says he would want us to stay in a reformed EU.
In fact, most people outside of the Ukip tradition and the wider circle of “small England” in the Tory may say yes to this.
It's the same thing as Hilary-Benn, but not Bennit-Benn said on radio and TV this week, and his inner boy scout refused to admit that Corbin's appointment of the infamous John McDonnell as the "shadow" minister of finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father was fighting hard on TV for not being loyal to his fellow Labour Office, without going too far or losing his position in the Cabinet.
Hilary's battle was more appealing.
But the fight to stay "in all circumstances" -- Benna's phrase -- is not what McDonnell said, or what J.K. said to the Peers and Members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, in general opinion.
Whatever the Democrat and "my boy" Corbin wanted to tell me - remember, he touched even me - the discipline of messages is still important in the 24-hour TV age seven days a week, and especially in the spiral of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and treachery.
It's wise to keep Cameron from getting rid of Europe so easily, allowing him to take proper support for the laborers during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbin's main misconceptions about EU membership - within the Bennith's besieged fortress economy - are no longer a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissenters, for whom narcissism, created by a small difference, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his misconceptions about Nato - Tom Watson - he is unrelenting in that J.C. will not agitate for leaving - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring it to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on British concessions, when all this can be pointless?
The US is already very disappointed by the weak British military actions in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, even though the Tory Government is in power to cut the cost, as I was reminded of on Monday at a luncheon in a forum called British Influence Security.
The experts are critical of the public health England’s view of electronic cigarettes.
The government-funded agency ' s claim that e-smoking is 95 per cent less harmful than smoking was made at the meeting by 12 people, some of whom are related to the tobacco industry, according to researchers.
Experts from the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE has published an important report, a "turn-off point" last month, calling it a "comprehensible review of evidence."
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the connection of some experts to the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the Journal of Medicine, Lancet last month criticized the “extremely shaky argument”, on the basis of which PHE built its main opinion.
In article BMJ, two other researchers asked whether the statements had “hard or dubious reasons”.
Martin McKee, a professor of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said, "The fundamental principle of health care - the rules must be based on proof of effectiveness."
According to them, the public expect PHE statements that “the current best estimate indicates that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed examination of evidence and simulation.
In fact, this emerges from the only meeting of 12 people who have met to develop a model of multi-criteria analysis of decision-making in order to sum up their views on the harm associated with the various nicotine-deficient products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKey and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed BAT health certificates in the sustainable development report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer without mentioning the funding that he was reported to have received from the Philip Morris tobacco company.
No sound explanation has been given for the selection of the board members, but there are a number of well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of whom have also announced the financing of the industry in the publication.
It is not known if the other participants in the meeting have any experience in the management of the tobacco business.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco station at PHE.
The scientific article published by the group “smartly accepts” that there is a lack of “hard proof of the harmful effects of most products according to most of the criteria”, wrote McKinley and Capewell.
However, none of these links and restrictions have been addressed in the PHE report.
McKey and Capewell said that the PHE statements that “at the moment there is no proof that e-smoking is a high-priced, non-smoking or high-risk” were premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of the PHE health and well-being course, said that BMJ applications had been answered before.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
One of the two smokers died of his addiction all his life.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public of what this evidence proves and does not prove, especially where the public has doubts about the relative dangers of tobacco.
About 80,000 people die of tobacco-related diseases a year, and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
Clearly, while electronic cigarettes are not safe, they do only part of the harm done by smoking - we do our job for the nation.
Former head of Channel 4 believes that BBC should stop the EastEnders show.
Former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson is of the view that BBC should discontinue the production of programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would have given up a lot for such a successful show as the soap opera on Albert Square.
Johnson observed that license fees should be used only to set up programmes that are not produced by other British radio and radio companies.
He criticized the BBC for putting public broadcasts, which are probably only a small part of the audience, at the peak airtime, when competitors are doing a high-rated show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said that the company wanted to work more with other organizations, Johnson noticed that he had been trying to work with BBC for six years without success while working at Channel 4.
"I can't help but think that the BBC is preparing for the start-up and is broadcasting programs that can show rival companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told the members of the House of Lords' Communications Committee as part of the BBC's future.
If you keep the license fee, which I don't think is a good medium- and long-term solution, then the company should only keep on the air those programs that are not being released and are not going to be released by other companies.
The Voice show is aired in the prime chair because the creators want the best possible support for the future.
The idea of no-one else showing it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't see why regressive taxes should go to finance transfers that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, the EastEnders is the other; it is well known that they are their own.
Other channels would no doubt have given up a lot for it.
I don't know how this can be a public service.
I don't think it would have lowered the BBC in any way.
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of pursuing the ratings "because of the staff's ambitions and their belief that this is the best way to get support for a long time."
His comments on the most popular show on BBC echoed the comments of Executive Director Sky Tony Bolla, who in his McTaggart Memory Lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 offered BBC to sell the EastEnders.
Johnson remarked that the more low-level BBC public service "continues to go to BBC4, where it is often not possible to estimate the audience, but the function of the company has been performed, and this can be presented as an argument in the practitioner's sermons justifying the 4-billion-dollar royalties: "Well, of course, we do all these incomprehensible broadcasts, which no one is watching."
They put it in a slot, where no one will ever watch it.
With regard to the license fee, Johnson told the committee, "I call on you to find a more regressive system as to who will get the most out of it.
Of course, you all think we all think £150 a year is a big sum, but for people who have £150 a lot of money, I wonder, they think it's because they don't really watch and listen to BBC.
The former executive director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, David Elstein, who also spoke to the committee last Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate Rita's mission to "inform, enlighten, and entertain."
He pointed out that only a small part of BBC's output was now formally classified as educational - he said it was 1% of the TV content and 0.1% on the radio - and that the company should take the initiative of the Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto of “inform, enlighten and entertain”.
With regard to the partnership, Elstein observed that BBC should do more in such areas as “External Concerts” (not a lot of them, he said, are on TV), as well as join alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for online viewing.
Soogenetics allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves.
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction of motion when they are exposed to acoustic impulses.
Scientists have extracted worms with a genetically modified neural system that can be controlled by sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change the direction of motion at a time when they're hit by sound impulses, too high for the human ear to hear them.
Pulses have an effect by activation of neurons that are genetically modified to use membrane canals that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Also on the subject: Researchers manage brains with light
Scientists have said that worms are showing the potential of a new method called "sonogenetics", which is to use ultrasonic to infuse certain brains, hearts, and muscles, while the source of ultrasonics is located outside the body.
Srikant Chalasani, a researcher at the Solk Institute, La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this method might one day replace the deep stimulation of the brain, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
The nematodes usually don't react to the ultrasonic, but Chalasani found that they were starting to react when they were put in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplified the ultrasonic waves, which then infiltrate the hearts.
Increased ultrasonic waves have an effect on structures called the "ion channels TRP-4" found in the membrane of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open up and inflame the cells associated with them, as reported in the report in Nature Communications.
To make a nematode that can be controlled by ultrasonics, Chalasani has made a genetic modification of the worms, so their motor neurons used ion channels TRP-4.
During the application of ultrasonics to modified organisms, the sound waves were reinforced with microscopic bubbles and injected into the hearts by activating modified motor neurons.
This method is similar to the one used in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with light impulses.
Chalasani states that, in comparison to this method, sonogenetic may have some advantages.
In contrast to the light brought to the right section of the brain by fiber optics, low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass unobstructed through the body ' s tissue, so you don't have to go inside the cranial box to deliver it.
"We believe that for the treatment of some neurological diseases in clinical settings, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses can, for the time being, make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasonic signal," said Chalasani.
He added that, in addition, the method could be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

Advertisements are taunting the British arms trade
Look at Amnesty International with a protest against the arms show.
Terrific killer drones!
Destroying iron shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light-noise truncheons that cause unbearable pain, but do not leave any traces!
A sterling voice and a drawing of animation leave no doubt that this advert to the largest international arms exhibition is a bitter emoticon prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British Government's intention to push weapons to oppressive regimes, using an exposition of defence and security systems at the center of ExCeL in Dockland.

But a special campaign has also led to the sudden arrival of a lot of posters at bus stops and on subway trains, which require a new look at them.
"A major ad on the DLR line from September 15 to September 18?", is written on one of them in the London subway fonts with a picture of the DLR line, which is becoming a silhouette tank.
In September this year, a mob of arms dealers will be on the DLR line. The passengers are being asked to help prevent the arms show.
300 banners are painted by artists who put out their work at the "Museum of Bad Design" in Banks Park "Dismaland".
A group called Special Patrol has helped to distribute them to London, using a “advertiser set”, a 6-pound set of gadget keys, which is said to “provide access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stops on the planet”.
London transporters don't have fun with such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the group's "Special Patrol" spots.
According to Gavin Greendon, the curator of the Cruel Designs Expo and a professor at the University of Essex, the artists are becoming more demanding and eager to bring political art to the audience outside the galley.
Many artists are starting to work with protest activists, realizing that they have to go to the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against an arms exhibition welcoming passengers in the subway.
The video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by a pro bono VCCP, with a graphic designer and an artist, also working free of charge.
The creative director of VCCP, Matt Lever, was amazed by the advertising silence surrounding the arms show, with an ExCel pass, and he thought, "Let's get them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought to create a more realistic and cunning corporate advertising, but "filling it at home with bright colors and animation has been more exciting."
"They have incredibly helped us draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
Now we need the British Government to take action and to guarantee that this torture equipment will not be sold illegally at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of an arms exhibition goes from within ExCeL, where the participants trade in fantastic euphemic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order from the U.S. Army for "AT4CS RS to shoot off the shoulder".
It includes “a weapon without analogues, which produces an insurmountable armor inside the target”.

Eight golden rules of stay in student dorms
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student dorm as a normal 19-year-old who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but it's just now that I remember the twitched smiles of the people I irritated, and multiple, long complaints about others.
Basically, what I've learned can be sorted out by eight simple rules.
A move to a dormitory can range from a bit on the nerves to a very frightening one.
He makes you talk to people about where you're from, where you've taken your academic vacation and where you've spent it, how you support Corbin, and why you're "honestly, I don't love, I don't hate Marmite, 'cause, seriously, guys, it's just a hahaha's yeast, I'll be at my place."
Take a break.
And help others take a break, too - ask questions and show interest.
This supports a conversation and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire, and they'd be handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms are often turned into drinking places, mid-night movie halls, and commonplaces, but they are also the place where people dress and fix their underwear.
On the subject: Don't even think about starting at a university when you're in a relationship.
Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room should be a shelter, but many dormitories form a culture of dilapidation from one room to the next, which promotes friendship, communication, and long friendships.
This can be hell for someone who's trying to get back on track.
Nothing in culture lets you say, "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to go, and I can regenerate the energy I've used to talk to you."
Try to feel like a fellow student is tired of talking to him - not knocking on him, but texting him.
Speaking of banging, do it.
A guy in my dorm was following this principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to come in.
He saw something.
Make friends with baking.
Since you're starting university life at the peak of the Bake-Off show, knocking on people's door to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate cookies -- not that weird, not so much like the 1950s with "Welcome, we're neighbors, I've baked you something, and now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to be friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and in the end, your face will probably be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Badly blinded lumps of flour, sugar, and fat will make people pretend to be sleeping when you knock on them.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dorms.
Of course, the embezzlement of someone's chicken is stealing, but is it stealing to take a little milk for tea?
Make it up to the milk owner.
He'll probably ask you not to be shy, even if it's hot inside out of anger.
If someone steals your stuff, it's irritating, and I'm sorry for you - but try to deal with it a little bit more than my neighbor, who poured a liquid in her milk to wash dishes to get back at the guy who took it without asking.
She's in jail now.
You don't have to make any noise that'll keep people from sleeping or learning.
Not just to be a decent man, but also because you're the same people in the saying about the glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked the neighbor to slow down the sound of drums and bass gitars, because it was 3:00 in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5:00 a.m., she mercifully let him sleep for two hours, and then turn on her music and lock the door behind her, leaving for a three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband settled in the same dorm as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extreme, before biting elbows, clumsy, if you'd take a neighbor for your future husband, get into it, break up a relationship, and have to see it every day, and maybe watch it push all your common friends on his side?
Of course, you can't tell the heart - but if a hot neighbor is definitely not your future husband, try to cool off your own anger a bit.
At a moment of excitement, when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between prank and molesting is thinner than it looks.
A good prank is fun, but it turns into the opposite in a few seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but don't ever pack someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the other guy's door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you'll put in the freezer - but don't stick the other person's stuff with Blu-Tack on the ceiling more than two times.
iOS 9: How to install a new operating system on the iPhone after the Apple update
You can request a new operating system from the Settings application to select General, and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will let you download it and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installing a bug report telling them that “Renewing the application has not been possible”.
In order to avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the rejuvenation is down or try to update via iTunes.
The tips on the phone will enable you to complete the process.
The process may include the removal of applications to expand the space, but Apple has minimally reduced the probability of this action by reducing the size of the update, and has also made it easier to do so by means of a special tool, which proposes to delete the applications and re-install them after the end of the process.
It is worth making sure that your phone is loaded or next to the charger in order to prevent the battery from being defused.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop refreshing, as decommissioning the phone in the process can result in an up-to-date failure.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity with a phone call.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support provided by Moscow to President Assad only led to an exacerbation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk to a Russian co-worker about it, writing PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“The Secretary of Kerry has made it clear that Russia's continued support for President Assad poses a risk of exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, and has a negative impact on our common goal, the fight against extremism, if we also do not continue to focus on finding a solution to the Syrian conflict through the direct transfer of power,” states the US State Department.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the US's commitment to the fight against the Islamic State in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad would never be a member.
In addition, the US “will welcome Russia's constructive role in trying to counter the Islamic State.
Last Friday, representatives of the White House said that they did not know exactly what the Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was about to discuss the matter with Moscow.
In fact, White House Spokesman Josh Ernest noted that the time for a phone call between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: "When the President decides that a phone call to President Putin will be in our best interest, then he will pick up the phone and try to make this call."
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for Assad's regime as a “lost bet. ”
I remember talking to Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him it was a mistake, that Assad's continued support would only make things worse.
"But he didn't listen to my warnings - and as a result, things got worse," the U.S. President said.
Imported yachts will be freed from the payment of customs duties.
The Department of Economic and Social Affairs intends to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating facilities for rest and sport from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
The relevant changes to the list of soft items for temporary duty-free entry have been prepared by the Ministry at the request of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Helena Lashkin, reported this to the News.
In June 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of the Russian Federation, following his visit to Crimea, commissioned a number of agencies, such as Minaconomy, Mintrans Russia, Miniculture, MFA, MSS, FSB, FTS, Rostourism, to prepare proposals to create an enabling environment for yachting in the country ' s coastal zones.
For their part, the experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
The owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad - about 200 million go to the treasuries of European States every year for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission on the amendment of the list of goods temporarily imported, subject to full conditional exemption from the payment of customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other recreational and sports facilities.
In the view of the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for the development of yachting in the country ' s coastal zones, Lashkin noted.
The matter was submitted to the Subcommission on Customs and Tariff, Non-Tariff, Safeguards in External Trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also endorsed by the agencies.
As the representative of the Ministry of Environment and Development noted, the proposed measure of full conditional release on entry was in fact a benefit.
Therefore, after the adoption of the minutes of the meeting of the Subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EEEC member States, explaining Lachkin.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from the payment of customs duties, taxes, includes the goods needed to support external economic activities and international cooperation, for application in the fields of science, culture, film, sports and tourism, for international assistance, etc. These include service equipment (computers, typewriters), monitors, rigs, stage suits and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, racers, motorbikes, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and religious objects.
In the press service of the Mintrans Russian Federation, Izvediens, it was reported that binding regulations had been issued on the maritime ports of Kerci, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupatory, which provided for a simpler procedure for the entry and exit of small, sporting sailing and recreational vessels to the sea port.
The Ministry of Transport has been entrusted to the captains of the Krim Sea Ports to ensure the application of a simplified procedure for the entry of small, sporting and recreational vessels at the sea port and for the departure of listed vessels from the sea port.
Mintransom has also prepared draft regulations for the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the border of the maritime ports of Crimea.
In the case of Yalta and Theodosia, the rest are in the process of being agreed upon, as noted in the press service of the agency.
In the view of MINTRANS, the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol are required to carry out State registration for small craft used for non-commercial purposes.
The problem is, in Russia, the yachting is very hard due to a weak infrastructure.
If you look to the south of Italy and France, it's a whole ever-growing industry with a lot of people involved.
In fact, in Russia, things are still in place.
Our shores are not very interesting, the only part where yachts can be used year round is the Black Sea in Sochi, Gelenjik, Novorossik, Anapa.
But the big problem is, in this area, the very strict rules of the border service: to go out on a yacht, a lot of permits have to be issued.
And there's not even a place to refill a yacht inside Russia.
She can go with her fuel for two days, and then there's a problem where to get it, says the sales director of Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
With regard to yachts, there are now special anchorages for yachts up to 30 hours in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Yachts are also sent to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany for storage.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are rich people, but with the start of the crisis, the demand for yachts has fallen.
The World Bank has provided Ukraine with a $500 million loan.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
The press service of an international organization has reported this.
“New financing will support a number of priority reform measures in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine”, states the report.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Simeo Fang, said that the reform of the banking sector would help to re-energize the real economy and stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and that the World Bank was witnessing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, the Fan has called on the Government of Ukraine to speed up reform.
Previously, the Polish government has approved a loan to the Y100 million Ukraine, transmitting the RIA News.
Prisons ask for separate units for transgenders.
At the Public Council of the Federal Service for the Execution of Sentences (FISIN) for the Protection of Sentenced Persons, in October 2015, one of the other issues to be discussed is the possibility of separate blocs for transgenders and transvestites in the colonies.
Councilman Vladislav Grib told the news about this.
In his view, depending on the total number of non-sex-defined convicts in Russia, it was possible to provide for separate cells, blocks or even (if there were many) in domestic prisons in the future to establish a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Greeb stresses that it is only possible to determine the sentence to be served in such isolated places after the convicted persons have been subjected to appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the offender is indeed a man who identifies himself as a member of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice was well-functioning abroad: the SIZO (where the accused are pre-trial) had separate cells for transgender persons and the correctional facilities had special units.
Today, this is the only way to work with such criminals.
The fact that the presence of transvestites and transgenders in normal cells is dangerous to them is the suffering of their families and a sea of trouble for FSIN staff.
The debasement of the trances on the part of the cellmates is assured,' says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on the size of the city, the number of indeterminate sex offenders, we also have to figure out where to distribute them.
SIZO's not exactly needed - just the cells, the blocks in the prisons.
Yeah, a separate colony is possible if there's a lot of transgenders.
As the Greeb explained, the block can contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps is set up in Russia alone, transgender prisoners can go there from any region.
Citizens are held in the SIZO at the place where the crime was committed, so the transfer of transvestites or transgenders from other entities during the investigation and the trial is not feasible, but the introduction of such a practice for those who have already been convicted in a separate colony - yes, the Greebe considers it to be.
Let us recall that the previous day, law enforcement officers were not able to determine in which pre-trial detention centre, male or female, was held for the possession of drugs by 24-year-old transsexual Dmitri Kojukov (known as Aline Davis), so that a man with a girl's face was not arrested.
He was released home on a non-exit note.
This news has been widely debated in social media and media, as there is no mechanism to keep transgender people in SIZOs and colonies in Russia.
The Russian human rights defender, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alexeyev supported the creation of special places to serve the sentence by transgenderers, noting that it was also possible to identify people in a colony - male or female - abroad, depending on their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is right.
Yeah, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, just like the issue of security in prisons for gays, says Alexeyev.
Prisons must be safe, so separate blocs could be made in the name of this and for gays, especially since there are more in the prison than transgenders.
But Alexeyev doubtes that there will be a lot of citizens in Russia who are willing to pretend to be transsexuals in order to go to a different colony.
Of course, you can have a medical examination before you put people in a transgender colony, but it's not always the same.
In the United States, for example, one of Chelsea Manning's prisoners looked like a man, and he already said he wanted to change his sex, he said to Alexeyev.
A man can feel like anything.
But as long as there are no separate places to serve the sentence for transgender people, I doubt that the prison staff will think seriously about the safety of such people and will be aware of the subtleties of their orientation or their sexual identity.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transgender offenders in a colony could greatly delay the start of the sentence.
A commission is being set up - it's a matter of sexology, and psychiatrists do long-term observations, and it's not one test on which a very accurate conclusion is made.
Today's psychic options make it possible.
So, even before a change of sex, potential patients are always subject to this kind of examination -- they are very clear about whether a change of sex with a surgical intervention is a necessary measure, "speaks Lordship.
But I find it hard to imagine how to implement this system in relation to convicts, as it takes on average a month to do so.
The doctor, even though the idea of creating separate blocs for transsexuals was generally supported, is also doubtful whether, in the current economic environment, it would be appropriate to allocate funds to the construction of new facilities, medical examinations, transgender units in Russia.
It's hard to tell, there are no official statistics, but given that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, it can be said that there are even fewer transgenderers, and those who have such a deviation and commit crimes are very few, say Lordship.
Now, at the request of the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgenders can already receive separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the Junior World Cup of chess.
The World chess championship was completed in Hunte-Mansca until he was 20 years old.
The end of the first place was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and he became a Russian, Michael Antipov, who was still able to catch up with the Pole, Jan-Kshištof Doodu, who seemed to be on his way to the title.
The girls celebrated the victory by the Ukrainian chess player Natalia Bux.
The World chess Champion, held in Hunte-Mansburg in early September, seemed to have lost most of the intrigue by the middle of the tournament, as the Polish representative Jan-Xishtof Douda, who had made a series of four victories (the competitions are held on the Swiss system in 13 tours), was firmly invaded by the leadership.
Given that Douda was the top-principle rating, and is generally considered one of the most promising young chess player, the chance that he would miss out was very low.
And even when Douda slowed down and let the Russian Mikhail Antipov narrow the gap to just a point of 0.5, he remained a clear favor in the title struggle.
After all, Antipov had to win the 13th round to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help if you won Dooda your party.
Plus, this commitment to win, of course, could have an impact on the Russian chess player's game and lead to non-mandatory mistakes.
Luckily, Mikhail Antipov was able to avoid them.
He was able to deal with Francesco Rambaldi with confidence, after which he had to wait for his party to complete Douda, who met with Benjamin Bok.
Luckily for Antipov, a Polish chess player put up a stand-up with a Dutch man.
So Antipov and Douda got an equal number of points, 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best extra scores.
And so it is to him that the leadership of the Huntia-Mansian Autonomous Region, whose Governor, Natalia Komarov, has traditionally focused on the development of chess in the region, has given a major prize.
But there was no intriguing ending in the girls' competitions.
The leader of the tournament, Natalia Buxe, Ukraine, was enough to win the title not to lose in the last round, and she did so with success.
So the victory of the Russians, Aliena Bivol, prevented her from catching up with Bux.
The Russian athlete was the second with a 0.5 point behind the champion.
The ashes change the regional structure.
The company brings the Milky and the Ural regions together in one major Wallsko-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East, the East region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As Wimpelcoma’s CEO, Michael Slobodin, has pointed out, the changes are being made to “main a strong player in the market,” to develop the company in a new, not always favorable, environment.
In an interview with "Russia 24", Mr. Slobodin explained that he intended to cut down the "tens" of the staff in Russia.
Rospresnadzor checked 78 Moscow Burger King Diners and issued 367 orders.
As a result, a restaurant on the Volocolom Highway was fined 50,000 roubles, and the place on the Grand Tull Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after all the irregularities had been resolved.
43 snack shops have violated the requirements for the accommodation.
Among other violations, poor sanitary and hygienic facilities, non-observance of the ventilation device, some facilities have found an intestinal group of bacteria.
Franchise for Burger King's brand is owned by Burger Rus, the owner of Alexander Kolobov's Network, and has 293 snacks in Russia.
Igor Artemijev, head of the FAS, stated that the agency was against indexing 10% of the freight and State subsidies, as requested by the OAO of the RZW.
First, they wanted 17% of indexation, now they want 10%, and they want multi-billion-dollar subsidies from the budget, he says.
We say, it's wrong, it's too much, it's too much, it's too much, it's gonna cost you your money, it's gonna save you, it's gonna take off the expensive mansions, it's the football team, it's your TV, it's gonna stop spending money on the left and it's on the right.
He added that the FAS has its own, “more strict” proposals, which are currently under discussion in the Government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net-account option for Sumeru Gold B.V., instead of a $300 million-full-assembled transaction, a gold-mining company reported.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the value of the Soumeru stock and the market quotes) that can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to implement the option or to request an extra payment.
The details of the Polymetal talks do not reveal.
The option was made as part of the purchase of the "Kisil" Polymetal project in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stassin, the director of the Department of Housing Policy of the Ministry of the Interior, reported that the Ministry was working with the BC to develop a system of sanctions for the developers.
"We know we can't go anywhere from this, so we're developing an appropriate mechanism," said the official.
The designs of the "Citizen Kane" movie will be put on the market.
The Auction House of Profiles in History reported on plans to put on the market a draft version of the film "Citizen Kane", which is considered one of the best works of the director, screenwriter, and actor Orson Wells.
The auction will start in the city of Calabas on September 29, with three drafts of the script presented, the estimated cost of each of them being $20,000 to $30,000, and the AP.
The first of the drafts, written in 1940 by Herman Mankevich, is the earliest script in private collections?
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, and the third is the final design of the movie.
Minprompt: Targeted food aid will not be the same as the USSR card.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Evtukhov, said that the targeted food aid programme would not be the equivalent of the USSR food distribution card system.
These include modern targeted food aid to the population and support for an effective domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the word "food card."
I should like to point out in particular that it is not necessary to confuse the proposed product maps with an echo of the total deficit of the past, a card-sharing system in which the number of products received is normal.
We have, for the time being, proposed a concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the law,” the TASS quotes Mr. Eutukhov.
Previously, UOO wrote that a food card program for the poor has been introduced to the government.
For more information on the Minpromptor Initiative, see OS "Igor Shuvalov has commissioned a food card."
The president of Rosgosstraha wants to divorce his wife.
The source informed RAPSI that the president of Rosgosstrach's insurance company, Danil Hachatururov, had filed an application with the Moscow Court for the dissolution of a marriage with the designer of Ulyana Sergienko.
The judicial section of the justice of the peace, number 100, will proceed on 16 September.
Danil Hachatururov asks for the dissolution of his marriage and the sharing of property.
The court confirmed the application for the dissolution of the marriage in the proceedings, noting that the property-sharing action had not been filed and would be brought before the District Court.
Mr. Alexander Bobreshov, President of the RZZZ, is leaving his post.
The USO vice-president of the Russian Railways (RZD) for corporate security, Alexander Bobreshov, leaves the company, reports Interfax, citing the source.
The Vice-Premier of Russia, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the RZZR, Arkady Dvorkovic, stated that the issue of leaving the RZD by Alexander Bobresov had been initiated by the new head of Oleg Belozerov.
According to the vice-premier, the staffing changes in the management of the RZD are not related to the change of head of the company.
Previously, OOO reported that in place of Wladimir Yakunin OAO, RZD led Oleg Belozer, the first Deputy Minister of Transport, who was in charge of the financial bloc.
The new head of the company announced for the first time reforms in the monopoly: within a year and a half, a new system of freight tariffs will be put in place.
For more information on the changes in the company, see OSL's "RZD will rewrite the values".
This year, a study by the Association of Russian Managers, Top-1000 Russian Managers, is being published for the 16th time.
As a tool to assess the professional reputation of Russian top-level managers, the study sums up the work of Russian managers over a year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates is made up of the winners of last year's ratings.
Last year ' s winners are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for the current year ' s rating and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the initial list is invited to nominate up to 10 new managers from other companies, who would be more appropriately added to the pool.
It is possible to nominate the following head of the company ' s functional areas: a financial director, a business director, a marketing director, a staff director, an IT director, a director of public and corporate relations, a director of government relations, and a director of corporate governance.
Each expert-proposed manager is invited to take part in the ratings and is given the opportunity to move up to 10 new managers from other companies.
Nominations are based on the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: Information Technology, Business Banks, Forest and Forest Processing, Engineering, Media, Metallurgy, Multidimensional Holdings, Professional Services, Communications and Telecommunications, Consumer Products, Insurance, Construction, Trade, Transport, Finance, Pharmaceuticals, Chemical Industry, Energy and Fuel Complex.
Each participant is given a login and password to log in to www.top 1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the rest of the participants and can make their assessments on the criteria proposed for each function.
Rating methodology is based on the "Best Choosing Best" principle: top-managers rate top-managers, function managers rate functional managers.
Such a principle provides the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of the co-workers.
The final results of the ratings are approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
In-person meetings of the expert commissions are invited to invite all candidates for this year ' s ratings and multiple candidates for previous years ' ratings.
The Commissions are organized on a functional basis: the Commission for the Approval of the List of Senior Managers and the eight Commissions for the Approval of Heads of Functions.
The meetings of the expert commissions are invited to approve the lists submitted in alphabet order (the places are kept strictly on the Internet and are closed until the rating is published) or to make up-to-date adjustments in accordance with the attached list of stand-by candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the rules of the UO.
At the time of the release of the rating, there are possible changes in the status of managers and companies.
The comfort rate for investment is 10-13%.
According to expert estimates, the small- and medium-sized business credit market in January-April this year is 40% low.
What are your estimates of the situation today?
After the panic of the end of 2014 - the beginning of 2015, the levels of BMS lending have fallen significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp rise in interest rates.
Loaning for 25 to 30 per cent of an annual was no good to anyone.
If an earlier bank could place all of its possible problems on a higher rate, from delays to non-returns, it is not possible to do so now: the stakes are already overstretched.
For the business, the current rate of UXO credit is inconvenient.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is not cost-effective.
The rate of 10 to 13 per cent would enable the business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate an attractive return on them.
How do you estimate that the demand for credit is being met?
The situation has improved a little since the CB rate was lowered.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, the clients started to apply for loans much less.
First of all, business does not understand the prospects for development and future incomes.
Today, business has one option: to learn to work on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
There is a need to monitor the current results more closely, to monitor the cash flow.
At the same time, if financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to upgrade equipment, reduce the cost of production and energy.
All of this, in the end, enables the company to make the product more competitive and to keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What major trends in the BMS credit market will be strengthened and will have an impact on its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast of a lower average rate will depend to a large extent on the Central Bank policy, and the regulator is now showing consistency in lowering the key rate.
But it is not worth waiting for a radical fall in the price of credit for the UXO.
In the current situation, inflation is a problem that makes it necessary to increase the interest rate for real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even if the CB’s rates are lower.
With regard to the level of lateness, it is common for small- and medium-sized business companies, which are limited both in their ability to replenish money and in their options for adjustment of economic behaviour, to be more risky for the lenders.
I wouldn't expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country ' s economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's how the word Mazda is spelled in Japanese characters.
It's beautiful, cunning, and at the same time it's pretty hard for people who're accustomed to the Cyrillic or the Latin.
And so the new CX-5 crossover, like any other brand model, is, like, unchartedly attractive from the outside, technically perfect from the inside.
Japan’s “Japannism ” can make its attachment to the products of the rising sun a state of total exhilaration.
You can make as much argument as you want for cars from other countries, and a man will even agree in principle with that argument, but the whole conversation is rife with the final phrase, "But it's a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people probably should love not just the technology, but all the other Japanese.
Quoting from Base's move, fixing Wasabi's food, collecting catanas, and dressing your girlfriend--no, not kimono, of course, but Japanese street fashion: sweet, creative, and very unexpected.
I think Japanese school uniforms are the only form that a girl likes to wear after school.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of CX-5 is a socket of a radiator with five horizontal lines.
But the new picture of the headlights and the backlights, by which the car will be immediately recognized in the flow of the car, changes the shape of the car.
As in the past, the Mazda CX-5 is very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensual, but the appearance is strict.
You don't have to call the police.
Driven by CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can only find a stoic Japanese tranquillity.
The Diesel Engine of 2.2 L provides a high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine is 175 l s. to a total of 5.9 l. The power unit shall be set up with an exclusively automatic transmission and full drive.
Black boots, black cape, black bag...
To add a bit of black humor to this image, you can select leggings with a print from a police tape Not Cross.
In fact, the Mazda made the best possible effort to keep you from driving your own CX-5 accident.
To make it even more comfortable, while maintaining excellent control, the suspension was rebuilt with the design of the front and back amortizers, as well as optimizing the shape of the front lower levers.
The full transmission system has been adapted to the Russian conditions.
The level of noise from road and engine at high speeds has been reduced by 13%.
A cupboard in a flower or a strip is as boring as a budget sedan.
It's different if a girl's in a bathing suit with an original picture.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of a role-player.
She'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design for both front and rear seats, which provides an optimal reserve of space for both wide shoulders, and for long legs, who has what.
And the long-legged ones will probably appreciate that the edges in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in the expressions.
The most extensive set of active Mazda security systems is proposed on CX-5.
Radars, lasers, and cameras are used to identify a potential threat.
There's an adaptive light here, and there's a warning about the off-the-band, and monitoring dead zones, and a safe stop.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best boots in the class.
Comfortable, with a minimum of protrusions, it contains a load of 561 litres. The rear seats are set in a ratio of 4:2:4 - with each section fitted with a separate drawbar - and expand the baggage compartment to 1,560 litres.
The image character's suit in Japan is called "kigurums."
It's a very pretense pyjama-kiguru.
You can do anything in it!
Of course I'm sleeping.
But also entertaining little kids.
Or just walking around like this on the street...
I mean, it's so cool to be able to make a choice -- cool dress, behavior, or a car.
Thank you for your help in the preparation of the material at Kawaicat.
Kyiv tore up the atomic unia.
Kyiv has formalized Ukraine's refusal to cooperate with Russia on the development of Khmelnitsk NPP.
The Supreme is pleased on Wednesday, from the second attempt, though, to vote in favour of the termination of the agreement with Moscow.
Arrangements for the construction of the third and fourth blocs have been signed as far back as 2010-2012, but the project has not been able to start.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine adopted a law to dissolve an agreement with the Russian Federation between 2010 and 2012 to build a third and fourth block on the Khmelnitsky NPP.
The bill introduced by the Government had been passed only after the second vote, and for the first time it had been supported by 210 deputies, with a minimum of 226, but 234 members of Parliament had voted in favour of the bill.
In the USSR, the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant was originally to have four units of 1 GW with a WWE-type reactor, but only two could be built.
Negotiations with Moscow on the extension led to an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and the Council passed laws in 2011-2012.
Since there was no funds in the Ukrainian budget, it was assumed that the building of blocks would have to be borrowed from the Russian side, but the funds had not been made available.
After the coup in Kyiv in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in the relations of the two countries, Kyiv began to end relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, declaring no cooperation on the Khmelnitsk nuclear power plant and on the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area in which the relationship continued to exist was the purchase of fuel in the Russian Federation for active Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of the country's electricity generation), as the Ukrainian NAEC “Energoat” had not yet replaced the Russian supply.
Plans to complete the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: as far back as 2014 in Kyiv, they announced negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.
UN Gensec against the use of military force in the resolution of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated during a press conference that there was no military solution to the situation in Syria.
"There is no war solution," the AP's response to a question about Russia's military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also indicated that he would meet with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the MFA of the permanent members of the UNSC later this month.
"The meeting will be on Syria," he said.
Earlier today, the Deputy Chief of the Army of Russia, Nikolai Bogdanovsky, reported that the General Staff did not rule out the possibility of a future airbase in Syria.
There are no such plans yet.
"But everything can be," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Previously, U.S.A. reported that the US does not trust the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, who claimed that military assistance to official Damaskus is needed to combat the Russian-prohibited “Islamic State” terrorist group.
For more information on US concerns about Russian aid to Syria, see the U.S. “The Russian Military Presence in Syria Worried Washington”.
In the PA, the OSCE reports a possible meeting of the Parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA), Arthur Gerasimov, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in south-eastern Ukraine.
“What I know: a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and the Russian parliamentary delegations”, the TASS quotes Mr. Gerasimov.
He also called for the implementation of the mine agreements and “to return to the normal life of our countries”.
On the question of whether, in his view, a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level - in the “Norman-style” or in the form of a contact group on the OSCE PA site - Mr. Herasimov has observed that the dialogue has been held, there are mine agreements.
At the same time, according to the policy, every type of dialogue is being promoted in Kyiv.
The representative of Ukraine at the talks, the former President of the country, Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Republics of Donets and Lugano had not, in principle, yet changed their position in the trilateral talks, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties have been given mandates.
Yesterday, the Bas-Novgorod Electoral Commission summed up the city duma elections for the municipal district by assigning 12 parliamentary mandates on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral irregularities have been made by PRRA representatives who have been accused of “falsifications”.
The opposition ' s comments were not accepted.
The group also refused to organize a referendum on the lifting of the rent for the renovation of multi-family homes.
The city bar officially presented the results of the election in the proud Bas-Novgorod municipal electoral district.
A total of 1.03 million people have been included in the Bas-Novgorod electoral rolls, 746,000 votes have been given to the regional commissions and 268,000 votes have been cast.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots have been declared null and void and 24 have been found to have been lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed to political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the “One Russia” list, the six deputies in the gorduma are based on Dmitry Swatkovsky, Dmitri Krasnov, Basilia Shopranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Viacheslav Rasteriaev and Igor Nagor.
The party leader, Vladimir Zhirinovski, was given the LDPR's sole mandate.
The two PRRA mandates are distributed between Vladimir Boulanov and the State Duma Member Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of “Just Russia” are given to Alexander Mindumovsky, Igor Bogdanov, and Mikhail Shaluguin.
Now, within five days, these candidates have to decide whether or not they will be members of the city ' s mind: if the mandate is abandoned, he will turn to the next candidate on the list.
The chairman of the oblast committee, Alexander Makeev, informed the commissioners that he was in the process of putting on a stand-by post for “a list of Girinovsky and others” in order to give up their mandates.
At the time of the adoption of the protocol on the outcome of the election, the representatives of the CPRR had stated multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, a member of the Gymnasium with the right to vote, proposed not to accept the results of the vote in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that the Chief of Administration of the Sormovsky Region had ordered the closure of the entrance to the administration building, where the four District Commissions were located.
Members of the State could not go inside for a long time, neither the candidates, nor the observers themselves, and the resonance of the storming of the divinity doors was shown on the TV.
All observers and commissioners with the right to vote had an opportunity to attend the meetings of the District Commissions.
The head of the board had not been able to reach them until the vote was over and the regional commissions had not yet come to deliver their ballots.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"Then the chapter was corrected, and at all the meetings interested persons were able to attend," a member of Natalia Andrewshin, a member of the Mountains.
The Communists objected to the fact that in the blocked administrative building for more than four hours, the Zaputate of the Assembly of the Region of Ludmile Aristoba was illegally held, and a complaint was sent to the Investigative Committee.
The opposition also resented the fact that, in a number of the PICs on the day of the election, they began sealing the urns at 6-7 a.m. by posting the ballot papers.
In so doing, the commissioners, with the right to vote and to observe, had not been notified, so they had come by the start of the election at 8:00 a.m.
The Communists are confident that in the morning before the opening of the polls, the ballots could be unchecked.
However, the mountain tube, which has already dealt with more than 124 complaints on various grounds, according to Alexander Makeev, found no infractions with the casts of unaccounted ballots.
Members of the commission did not support the proposal of their colleague from Fair Russia, Maria Popová, by means of an lick to come out of the regional legislation, to make clear the time of the opening of the envelopes with the early ballots, which would then be in the urn.
"Go to the CEC as your own initiative," advised Mrs. Popo Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, the Chairman was hit with a strong accusation by CPRF member Sergey Samahin, who was yelling that he was ignoring dozens of complaints and covering forgery in the elections.
"You're not here at a meeting, be careful to say it!", the president of the bench.
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
By 27 September, the bench is to approve the overall results of the election, after which the first meeting of the City Duma of Lower Novgorod of the Sixth Assembly will be scheduled for three weeks.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the city electoral commission denied the political party “Communists of Russia” the registration of the action group for a local referendum.
According to the records, the parties were going to bring to the lower city ' s discussion two questions: do they agree that the rents for the renovation of multi-family houses need to be "remove immediately" and the cost of housing and public services should be "freeze by 2020?"
However, Irina Maslova, a lawyer of the Duma duma, explained that the application of the “Russia Communists” was contrary to the law.
The FedEx is a mixed source, with a fall in the projections for 2016.
FedEx reported on the disconcerting results of the last quarter, and the giant delivery service lowered the forecast of annual returns due to a fall in demand for freight services and an increase in the cost of its land transport unit.
The company also stated that it was planning to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time, FedEx reported last year that he would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares increased by about 2.5 per cent in pre-bid bids 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that he was planning to make $10.40 to $10.90 in the fiscal year, which ends next May, which is 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts presumed $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast has been down despite an average of 4.9 per cent rise, which will come into effect on 4 January, and an increase in the cost of land-based transport of heavy or bulk cargo, which is beginning in November.
The company stated that it was still planning an increase in revenue from last year, thanks to a reduction in costs, an increase in gross income and an increase in online trade.
The Chairman and CEO, Fred Smith, stated that the company “was stable in view of the weak relative to the forecast of economic conditions, especially in production and world trade”.
Job plans for the holidays were announced the day after the bid of the competitor, UPS, that they plan to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same number as they did last year.
FedEx earned $692 million in a quarter that ended August 31, an increase of 6 per cent over the year before.
The share's income was $2.42, close to the forecast of an average of $2.44 for a stock investment research survey of 12 analysts.
The income rose by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six Analysts interviewing Zacks had an estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been affected in recent years by a recession in the international fast transport sector, which has led to a lack of growth in gross income in its rapid transport unit.
But the Internet shopping boom has dramatically improved the FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the revenue from land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the operating income remained the same, owing to the increased cost of major shipments and self-insurance.
The Freight Unit has earned a higher return due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector, income has fallen due to higher labour costs.
In the pre-bid bids, about an hour before the opening of the exchange, FedEx stock fell by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday by 11 per cent a year and 17 per cent below the record of 11 June.
At the most welcome meeting in a few years, the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from Honduran redwood, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost 10 years.
At one end, a rich decorated meeting room, two-story-high, will hang a wall image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues should put the country ' s economic interests above all others.
The Central Bank was given a double assignment from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to keep the price here stable.
But since the Great Recess, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is a third, undeclared task: financial stability.
And this third commission may be an unknown factor in the almost predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to break off from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data show strong growth in the economy, the recent upheavals in the global financial markets can keep the already cautious leaders of the federal system from adding volatilism by raising the base rate on federal funds – even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lyndsey M. Piegza, the main economist of the Stefel Nikolaus & Co.
"But I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the stakes, the increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait on," she observed.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve, which in itself is causing the financial market to fluctuate.
About half of the economists recently surveyed Bloomberg predicted an increase in the interest rate this week.
The financial markets, however, expect the federal system to withstand this, with a key indicator showing only about 30 per cent of the chance of a rapid upturn.
This can result in a fall in the stock market if the federal system raises the rate, provided that the decision-makers do not soften the blow of the promise that the next increase will not be forthcoming.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The take-off was prompted by the expectation that the people who shape the Federal System's strategy would stay the bet this week,' said John Lonski, the main economist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It would be a surprise if the federal system would raise the stakes at this point in time," he remarked.
If the management of the Federal Reserve does so, "we're gonna have to go a long way in approving their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so they don't panic."
Other experts objected that an increase in the rate could calm the financial markets, as it would remove the uncertainty about how the federal system would work.
Just a month ago, the federal system seemed inclined to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, making the first small step in slow tightening the financial conditions, which might prove the strength of the US's recovery.
Yellen stated in spring and early in the summer that she was looking forward to raising the rate this year, despite the claims of the liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although new jobs slowed down in August, the growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in over seven years, and almost at a level that the Federal system considered to be full-time.
Wage increases show signs of acceleration.
And, while inflation is still below the central bank’s target of 2 per cent, the Federal System’s management has stated that the key cause was the temporary effect of a sharp fall in oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the decline in the labour market,” Ian Schaefferson, the main economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, remarked.
But financial markets around the world began to tremble at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Johns average index for industrial stock fell by as much as 16% relatively high in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy might hinder global growth.
The market has partially regained its position this month, and the Dow Johns index is now about 10% below the high May value.
For the management of the Federal Reserve, market upheaval makes it even more difficult to calculate the time limit for the interest rate.
“In the absence of information on what has happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have been tying up the problem at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior UCLA researcher, Ziman Center for Real Estate, and a former Federal Reserve.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty as to what the effects on the American economy can be, and they have little reliable data after the recent events in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal system, and it should not be technically taken into account in making these decisions.
But in fact, the Federal Reserve has become a global financial power.
The Central Bank's influence has been immense in recent years.
A mere hint from the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013 that the Federal Reserve can “defuse” its monetary expansion has caused market upheavals around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve will not only follow developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other Headquarters banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process, “More Arts than Science”, noted Zachary Carabel, head of the Envestnet Inc, a company that addresses global state-management strategies.
Geoffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, said this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve, there have been cases of overreaction to the movements of the financial market, which do not seem to be related to economic principles”.
Laker, a member with the right to vote of an influential federal open-market committee, who insisted on an increase in the rate, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Federal System to lower its base rate by 0.75 per cent in three sessions, “despite the limited identifiable effect on growth in the US”, Laker said.
A year later, the Federal System’s leaders lifted the cuts.
The federal back-up system should focus on stability only in times of major crisis, such as the 2008 collapse of the market,” said Adam S. Pozen, a former member of the interest committee at Bank of England.
The last panic didn't get close to this level, he said.
"You certainly wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're intimidated by the rise in the stakes because the markets are shaken," said Pozen, the president of the Peterson Institute of World Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and no mention of financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should go ahead.
You need a good Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yeah, Chinatown.
The market/shop was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
It's often called Thai Costaco, LAX-C, the Thai bulk market, which also sells to the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Ty Town.
The market/shop is a shop where you can buy everything at once, offering a dizzy selection of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian appetizers, kitchens, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even a car department if you need to get some butter for the engine.
The shop is big, and it's gonna take over an hour to search all the rows.
If shopping causes you to starve, buy food from LAX-C BBQ Express.
The Cooking Department in the shop (good and inexpensive) is not far from the cashier's office and offers various options for taking out.
What do you suggest? Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
The prices of the goods are reasonable, and a lot of the goods are sold in bulk.
Fresh products include fine Asian and local Thai herbs, fruits, and so on.
The meat bar is diverse, as is the fish bar - the staff behind the counter will clean up and split the fish, and even fry it for you, if you like.
The bulk of the shop is under an impressive freezer, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter pumpkin and galangal, ducks all, fish, beef blood and gall, pork carcasses, caviar, local sausage, semi-processed, and so on.
Who buys it, the owner and the chef of the restaurants, as well as the family and the individual buyers.
There are shopping carts and forklifts in the wide passage.
Find: Fresh Durian Montong next to the exit.
The shop is located in the industrial part of Los Angeles, adjacent to the outskirts of the Chinese block and the business center of the city, a few blocks from the Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has his own site, which he shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although there may be a lot of people in the shop, it is usually easy to find a parking lot.
The Speaker of the State Duma, Sergey Narishkin, admits that the US is deliberately destabilizing the Middle East so that the waves of refugees go to Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this view to the journalists in Ulaanbaatar as part of the fall session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a supporter of conspiratorial theories, but the question is, is it not Europe the ultimate goal of those who, with such manic perseverance in recent years, have destabilized the countries of North Africa and the Middle East?", he asked.
"Surely someone thought and knew that the flows of refugees, these miserable and destitute people, who are fleeing from death, would run to the well-off EU countries," he added.
Naryshkin asked, "How many political leaders in Europe have spoken out about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally overwhelming their countries? "
"No, old Europe, with few exceptions, prefers to keep quiet," he said.
According to Narishkin, NATO is flouting many European values and international law.
“Europe, sadly, has long and unbiasedly been watching and watching the military boots sewn according to NATO standards as well as moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and rules of international law,” the Speaker stressed.
Government forces and their loyal paramilitaries are opposed by rebels, who are mostly Islamist.
Later, the terrorist group, the Islamic State, banned in Russia, joined the opponents of the Syrian Government.
The US supports the rebels, who are opposing both Assad and IG.
Official Damascus regards such rebels as terrorists.
The President of Syria has described the cause of the West's aversion to Russia.
Western claims to countries such as Syria, Russia, and Iran are, in fact, sovereign States.
This view was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, Channel I, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax, and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners or sovereign States.
In those countries, he wished to take one man out and put another in his place, who would act in the interest of Western countries rather than in the interest of his country, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of Western media, with the beginning of a coup in Ukraine.
For them, he said, Russia's President, Wladimir Putin, has “became from a friend of the West to an enemy, a king, a dictator, who suppresses the Russian opposition, who has come to power in an undemocratic way, even though he was elected as a result of the democratic elections recognized in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad in the fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West’s constant statement that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he left, at the request of the people, not at the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference, or the Geneva Communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the president stays, or if not, he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that cooperation was taking place with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
Referring to Iran ' s military support, the Syrian leader observed that the country supported the Syrian State in the political, economic and military spheres.
He denied the allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Teheran is supplying us with military equipment.
“Surely there has been an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always taken place,” he explained.
As far as the rest of the States are concerned, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a strong desire to combat terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Iigil coalition led by the United States," Al-Assad pointed out.
The number of deaths was over 230,000, and the number of refugees was 11.5 million.
A part of the territory was seized by a terrorist group, the Islamic State, which was banned in Russia.
The U.S.-led international coalition is taking air strikes at IG positions.
In Utah, 12 people died from the floods.
In the U.S. state of Utah, at least 12 people died as a result of the floods.
Another one is reported missing, handing out Fox 13 Salt Lake City.
The water drained a number of cars with people in Washington County.
One of them, the van where the family was, stopped in a dangerous zone near the water, and the stream suddenly hit it.
The youngest of the victims was four years old.
All the dead are from Colorado City and Hildale, which have been hit by the storm.
Three children who have been rescued have also been reported.
There are 650 teams involved in search and rescue.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: Lenta.ru
US Secretary of State John Kerry made a phone call to Russia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov.
Reuters reports this with a reference to John Kirby, a representative of State Department.
It is noted that the subject of the interview was the conflict in Syria.
Kirby, however, did not submit any further details.
At the same time, he stated that the US has the tools for “the longest isolation of Russia” if it supports Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, handing out the RIA News.
According to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a conversation with Kerry, Lavrov re-emphasised the need to create a unified front to combat terrorist groups operating in that country.
Ways to address the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula, were also discussed.
In addition, some issues of a bilateral nature were raised.
United States officials have previously stated that Russia is increasing its military presence in Syria, and have expressed concern about the strengthening of Moscow ' s support for Assad.
Washington stated that if Russia continued to support Assad, it would be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, President Dmitry Pescow, the press secretary of Russia, said that the country would not be in international isolation.
The rebels are in favour of the overthrow of the Assad regime.
A part of the territory has been seized by an Islamic State terrorist organization.
An international coalition led by the United States is subject to air strikes by IG positions.
The beard called the information in the American newspaper a slander on the Schurkov.
The former president of the Government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Bearda, denied the information published in The Washington Post.
In a phone interview, he told Lenta.ru.
The note at the Washington Post is beautifully because it's totally overturned.
The former Minister of Defence of the DPRD, Igor Scharkov, of course, was not bound and he "was out" from the Republics of Donbassa in a very uplifted spirit, with no strings, no three furs of money, which are attributed to him by different characters," he noted.
According to beroday, the talk about the Shooter was really going on with a reporter in the American newspaper.
"Yes, I said that it was an urgent need to delete from the Donetsk People's Republic," said the former head of government of the DPRN.
The beard stressed that it was not clear to him why the reporter of the United States press decided to write that the Shooters had been taken to Russia “linked”.
I suspect it's a provocation.
If it's not a provocation, it's an astonishingly misunderstood word, because I stressed that the Shooters left themselves,' remarked the Beard.
"This is a slander against both me and the Shooter," he concluded.
A previous article on the pages of The Washington Post contained the words of Beroday that he had forcibly taken Sholkov to Russia.
According to the publication, Beard said he was forced to bind his co-worker.
The Polish authorities have begun to search for a train with Nazi gold.
Polish loggers have begun to cut down trees over an underground tunnel, where, according to some data, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
The work began on Tuesday, 15 September, reports the Reuters.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clean up the forest in order to test the veracity of the rumours about the trains with treasures.
Armed and valuable minerals can be found inside the train.
On August 31, the Polish voivodeship governor Tomás Smolarz (Tomasz Smolarz) suggested that the new proof of a gold train was no more convincing than the previous one.
The authorities, however, decided to block the search area.
Three days earlier, the Polish Deputy Minister of Culture, Peter Zhukhovsky, stated that local treasure-searchers had found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich, described in the legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are found, they will become the property of the State Treasury, and the treasure will not be handed over to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of a law firm approached the Polish city of Walbžih with a report that they had found a train in a closed tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The main drugologist of the Russian Federation has proposed to prohibit the sale of tobacco to persons up to the age of 21.
Russia’s main drugologist has proposed to ban the sale of tobacco until 21 years of age.
Yevgeny Bryne noted that up to this age, “any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - is particularly harmful”.
So he said live on Radio Voice of Moscow, commenting on the fact that the Speaker of Sovfed Valentine Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years of age.
A man grows up in an unbalanced way.
You can be in the army from the age of 18, and you're physically ready for it.
He's mentally ready to live a full life in society since he was 21.
"We know from the scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, is only about to grow up by 21, "Brune remarked.
Previously, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the “Treaty Russia” project, sultan Hamzaev, told the news, that Matvienko had supported the initiative to raise the age of the liquor and “agreed to raise the issue again with the Public Chamber on the site of the upper House of Parliament”.
According to the activist, a working group will soon be set up in the Federation Council to draft a bill led by Matvieenko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the Law on the Information Protection of Children
A resident of Novosibirsk requested the Regional Prosecutor's Office to check the Bible for compliance with the Federal Act on the Protection of Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development, and a statement was made on 16 September by Correspondent Sib.fm.
The author stated that on August 26, 2015, he bought a Bible at the Chitay City shop on the Red Avenue, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his view, were in violation of the FZ “On the protection of children from information that harms their health and development”.
On 16 September, the application was accepted by the Prosecutor ' s Office in Novosibirsk.
The response to the address of the resident of Novosibirsk will take place within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
Much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, the complainant commented to Correspondent Sib.fm.
And it's a very fundamental problem that will engender a society.
But it will begin to reread the Bible, which it has not done before.
The Brazilian Union of Pediatricians, Rio Grande, promotes a healthy diet for breast-feeders
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS has come up with a scandalous method that is going to convince women of the need for a full diet during breast-feeding: the method is to show images of babies sucking their breasts with images of harmful food.
Breast-milk is made up of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
In view of the high energy needs of pregnant and pregnant women, it is recommended to increase the daily calorie ratio by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study has shown that one increase in calorie is not the only change in diet that a mother should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affect the expression of the genes in children and prevent the development of their tumours.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy diets on the child ' s immune system was found.
A school bus was hit by a train under Hamburg.
A train hit a school bus in the vicinity of Hamburg, which was stuck on the railroad.
A 23-year-old woman driver, realizing that she could not move off the rails, ordered 60 pupils to leave the vehicle.
And a minute after that, they had a collision in front of them.
He was videotaped by one of the kids.
The emergency caused a panic among the students.
Some children began to cry and run along the side of the road.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was harmed by a miracle except one train passenger who was lightly injured.
The damage from the accident was estimated at Euro300,000.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local sportsman David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries sustained in a fight with the Filipino Carlo Magali.
The International Boxing Federation (IBF) regional titles in the weight category of up to 57.15 kg, which lasted on Friday, ended with Magali's victory in the 12th round.
Brown was in the hospital with a brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to a life support device.
Brown won 22 victories in the professional ring, suffered only two defeats, and one battle ended in no way.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second fatality among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student, Bradon Smith, died of injuries in the ring.
The AMA now recommends not to engage in this sport, but rather to prohibit it at all in its view.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally, the vice-president of the organization, Stephen Pairnis, said.
But in the way boxing is now, there will always be situations where an athlete has a hemorrhage or brain injury, which either causes death or serious damage.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body that brings together medical practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to lift the sanctions against Russian Parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, Sergey Narishkin, said that the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians was unacceptable.
He stated this at the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We view this as unacceptable actions, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated, because it is an expression of political shame and a disregard for the principles of open international dialogue”, said the politician.
In addition, Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to re-establish the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's get morals back to politics.
Let us return dialogue and the right to international communication.
Let us put humanist ideals back in a democratic world order.
"Doubleness has never been a good end," he said.
Speaking from the seat of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Speaker of the Russian State called on Parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
“First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiation and to immediately convene our inter-parliamentary group,” Naryshkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be commended.
"This is almost the only common ground where we still have to talk about how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the politician stressed.
We recall that the fall session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar, and will last until 18 September.
Enjoyed the win for a couple or three days.
The world champion at the Sergey Schubenkov Light Athletics.
This season is a triumphant one for a 24-year-old light-baller from Barnaul Sergey SCHUBENKOVA.
He was able to win 110 meters at the top of European command, to set up a number of records, and, above all, to become a world champion, the first in history to be the national barrier sprint.
In addition, the sportsman recently won the final stage of the Brilliant League, taking third place.
The New News has asked Schubenkov to share the impressions of the coming season.
Sergei, is the season not over for you?
Yeah, I'm gonna go to the World War, which is gonna be in Korea in October, and then I'm gonna think about rest.
True, I'm going to be at home in Barnaul, and being at home is still a very different state.
It's easier than every week to go around the world.
You once said the fall was your favorite time of the year.
The end of August, the beginning of September, is a great time.
The passion after the main start of the season has been overwhelmed, and the burden of responsibility is no longer pressed.
You can have fun at relaxing.
Plus, you know, vacation's pretty soon...
Are you tired?
After all, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions...
Tired up by the end of the season is always accumulating.
And it doesn't matter what I've done more, wins or loses.
Every competition is stress.
Flighting, moving, it's not going anywhere in the body.
You get up physically and emotionally.
But right now, I'm emotional, of course.
What's up? I'm just happy.
By the time you finished the Beijing World Cup, do you come back a lot?
It happens.
And you reporters keep me from forgetting it.
But in fact, I think it's bad for an athlete who's been living old victories, running his successful run over and over again.
Enjoyed the win for a couple or three days, and we have to move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
I can't say there was something special.
We started to get ready in December, but I missed the winter season.
Trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the prep, then at home again.
It's the usual.
But with the trainer, the challenge was to try to get to a new level I haven't been to.
Virtually all winter time was spent setting up a base.
We ran through a lot of sneakers, we put in a lot of physical fitness exercises, which included both traction and seating, and we rolled our backs.
And then we went to the barrier training, and we used to do a lot of tech.
You've been watching your opponents?
I'm always trying to do this, and there's no problem with the Internet age.
I saw the European Winter Cup, and there, in a barrier sprint, the French took over the pedestal!
I thought I'd do something, dilute this company.
With every start of this season, you've added and added to the results.
Did it give you confidence?
I've got all the last seasons going on about the same way.
There's no way I'm running first 13.20 and then 13.50.
I'm always spinning my form in a step-by-step way.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was focused on this result.
But the paradox is, it kind of feels like you're ready to do a feat, and it's not always a show of readiness at a competition.
How was it, for example, at the London Olympics?
I, to be fair, that semi-final race.
It was really good, really running out of 13 seconds.
Even if I'd repeated my best performance at the time, I'd be a bronze player in the game.
But bad luck.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
What about it?
It was in Tagu.
I really wanted to get into the finals at the time, it was a program-maximum.
And fell right off in the morning, in the pre-runs.
That's when I realized that torn and torn my head off means not to go anywhere at all.
Two years later, at the Moscow World Cup, he entered the finals with the best time.
I remember how I felt in front of the final race: I really wanted to win the gold at the time!
How do you get a good speed, not lose your head, not shut down?
And this is the hardest part.
You need to be very careful, focused on technology, so you don't have to take down the barriers.
I've noticed that it's much easier when you're focused on the process rather than the result.
And the hottest thing is when you get the feeling you're running and it's like you're doing it!
I swear it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the depths of the country, after their first major successes, are trying to move closer to the capital.
You've never thought like that?
Home's still better.
I don't know where I am without my trainer, who needs me?
It may be good to have a better deal, but I'm trying to be content with what I have.
How long have you two been together?
Ever since he was 12 years old, since he went to athletic light.
Well, first I was training with his wife, who worked with the kids, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, and then I jumped in a three-way.
The kid's multi-war was when the ball was thrown, the ball was leaping from place to place...
At 14, he tried running with the barrier, and I loved it.
Since the first race, it has been possible to meet the second-grade level.
I'm still here.
There's never been a fear of the barrier?
One day, I got a deal with them.
But there's always been a lot of work on the tech.
There's been a lot of pain in one race!
But this routine's not gonna get anywhere.
Tech needs to get up all the time - so I can wake up at night, I get up right now, and I can run through the barriers.
All those who saw your race in Beijing say it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
Normally, I don't rethink my run, and I can't help it.
But we have to work on efficiency - there's no limit to perfection.
Don't you fear that a win one year before the Olympics will be on your shoulders?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet my expectations.
If you pick this path, you have to go to the end.
My trainer likes to say, if you're not weak, you don't have to feel any extra load.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashville
Well, I'm not so naive that I'm amazed at the reaction to the interview in Ukraine.
People are mad, I know. Don't feed their bread. Give it to the enemy.
And even though I didn't fly the flag, and the same thing, exactly the same thing, a million times I've been talking here, and I didn't call it a fucking bastard, I was hit by another thing.
All my pseudo-friends just blinked, and they just vanished in a second.
The pressing I'm subject to is so strong that even I, when I've seen the kind of boy, think people are full of whites.
It was like walking, walking, and you were attacked by a mob, and you're gonna have to put your hands on it.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a howitzer, old man, I'm afraid.
The other thing is, there's no support.
I didn't have any illusions, and now...
The best thing about me was self-sufficiency, so bite it.
And giving passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson can only be idiots.
I wish I, the best journalist, was a shameful job.
A week ago, in Kyiv, Otar Kushanashvili remarked in a dramatic fashion on Crimean Events:
What was done to the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I believe that the reference to how the drunk Khushchev was trying to sign something is in no way relevant to the general picture of the human dormitory.
It's like coming to the neighbor and taking his place...
The war from the Kremlin has taken place, and it will end only there.
I'm almost 100% sure, as in the summer of 2008, it started with a call from some son of a bitch from the Kremlin's cell.
I have an idea who it might be...
Cobzone isn't much left to live.
I don't get it, he's the greatest artist, why he has to lick Putin's hands.
Is he gonna lose his apartment?
Well, he's been demolished.
Of course, people remember it as an affront to their small homeland.
And now it's up to Vladimir Vladimirovich to reconcile.
Sunrise Seven is in the lead despite the 9th attempt to highlight the Loss of Leaders at Today Show
Carl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson's attack on Canberra to cover the implications of the Liberal Party's announcement to release the leader's seat was not able to raise the Today rate very much.
The 9th morning show was aired from the state capital after Malcolm Turnbull's demolished Tony Abbott.
The rival, Sunrise, with the leading David Koch and Samantha Armitage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
This was not much of an Australian viewer's experience with the Sunrise audience of 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities, as compared to the Today audience of 339,000.
Today has a slightly higher rate than last Tuesday (317,000) and Monday (283,000), but it was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged from 40,000 to 50,000.
So far, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers in September, as opposed to 314,000 in Today.
That's the most interesting thing that's been going on all morning.
The winds of change are more powerful than the Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the update!
Published by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015.
The big news for Seven was the brilliant debut of 800 Words with the former star of Packed to the Rafters, Eric Thomson.
The new drama of a newly widowed father of a family who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children has brought an impressive audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics reasoned whether Thomson could deal with the popular show alone, without the Raffers star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night was a big yes answer.
The X Factor of the 7th was in a strong position with an audience of 1,136 million viewers, bypassing The Block (838,000) and the TBL Family (726,000).
For the seventh, the luck and failure of the second evening of the Chase Australia was mixed.
The first half an hour (from 17:00 to 17:30 a.m.) of Andrew O'Keefe's new TV show brought together 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (from 5:30 to 6:00 p.m.), the figure jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough to win the Hot Seat by Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 spectators, and the second half-hour was overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat has collected 620,000.
The drop in the Chase Australia ratings for the second night will make the 9th quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5:30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which failed to replay the McGuire show.

The three finalists agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who's he gonna pick?
The secret's out? ...
Lana Jevon-Fellows, Sarah McKay, and Snow Marcoski may have accidentally shown us which one of them will win at The Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will end up in The Bachelor's is surrounded by a cloak of mystery.
And the three girls who got to the end of the day, of course, keep silent about who got his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snow Marcoski, and Lena Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two of the three girls would have to be left, they might have accidentally given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood stays silent until the end of Thursday.
All three women come in a liric spirit, explaining why Wood is a perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, purpose, family values, joy as a reason why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
But by answering the question, "If you don't, who's gonna get the last rose of Wood?" they could unwittingly tell us which one of them actually conquered the heart of The Bachelor.
Jevons-Fellows and Marcoski have no doubt called McKay the perfect match for Wood.
Sarah and Sam have had a good relationship since day one.
"Since I was part of the show, I felt the energy (Sarah) and the energy of Sam, and I knew they were very fit for each other, and I didn't doubt it all along," said Jevons-Fellows.
"Sara is a very open man, with her easy and fun," added Marcoski.
I saw them together, and there's a pull between them.
They feel good and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna make a great match.
MacKay herself said that thanks to her home-dates last week, she realized that Wood might be "the man."
"The moment I saw him among my friends and family, I realized it was definitely not just a game -- I believed him with all my heart," she said.
The question of who to choose voodoo, if it wasn't her, she answered in a mysterious way.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snow and lana deserve it the same way.
The Bachelor show is released on Wednesday at 7:30 on Ten.

Jarrid Hein had a number of options to start his career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle have taken a lot of interest in him since he moved to the United States, as well as a lot of other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open day at the end of last year.
But hain chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsul, and it seems to have been a wise choice.
Some of the coaches would have left hain on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former Australian rugby League player allowed on the first return of the pant in a win-win game with the Minnesota with a score of 20-3.
But tomsula believed in his player and gave hain another chance to get back the punk, and he used it in the game after Reggie W. Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed up on the good side after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of getting the newcomers out in front of the team, he cheered them up.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hain at a press conference after the match.
The Special Reporter of the 49ers Club, Cam Inman, reported that Hein also received support from Thomas McGoy's Special Team Coordinator, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and to think about the next game.
Jarrid Hain lost the ball on the return of the pont by the Minnesota Waikings team during the first quarter.
This is the start of the NHL debut that Hain and his many Australian fans clearly didn't expect.
You can see Hain swearing off the field after he lost the ball, and then he told the host of the show "Hames and Andy" at Radio 2DayFM 104.1, Australia, that he could not imagine a more bad start for a career at the NFL.
"That's what happens, you just think about the next game and that's all," said Hain.
Hein compared his debut in the Origin series in 2007, when the ball was shot in his credit zone by Queensland.
In the end, this experience was very useful for a 27-year-old player.
Hein took a picture with an Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a picture to Instagram.
Elton John and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkowski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under the threat of use of weapons at the airport in Siberia.
Openly defying President Wladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized, and his efforts to develop democracy were halted.
On the border of Hungary, there have been clashes between migrants and the police.
The refugees protested at the border of Serbia near the Hungarian locality of Resquet, which has grown into clashes with law enforcement.
As a result, the Hungarian police used water wells and tear gas, handing out the Reuters.
The migrants stone the police and try to tear down the border fence.
Support has been sent to the scene, and the police have responded to the aggressive actions of the migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serb-Hungarian border by bus to Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reports BBC.
The country ' s authorities had allowed migrants to enter Croatian territory and to transport them from there to the right country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers have been injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament tightened the legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments include the participation of the army in the protection of State frontiers, the prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, as well as an accelerated procedure for the processing of asylum requests.
The Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegal crossing the Hungarian-Serb border, so he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider the transfer of border security functions to the Hungarian Armed Forces in the near future.
In late June, the Hungarian authorities began the construction of a barbed wire barrier 175 km long on the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees to the country.
The Russian confessed to committing the largest cyberattack in United States history.
An accused of the largest cyberattack in United States history, a Russian man, Wladimir Drinkman, confessed to stealing over 160 million credit card numbers, reports Reuters.
During the trial, Drinkman confessed to collusion with the state of New Jersey to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, a Russian spoke of a collusion with three Russians and a Ukrainian citizen who were accused of cyberattacking 15 companies.
The total loss from the actions of the accused was estimated at $300 million.
“Such defendants as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, are a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security,” states U.S. Attorney Paul Fischman.
Drinkman faces 30 years' imprisonment, and a fine of a million dollars.
The court will take account of the Russian ' s confession and may shorten it.
Drinkman's sentence will be pronounced on January 15th.
Wladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitri Smilnut, was taken into custody.
The last one denies his guilt for the crimes he is incriminated with.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk with Russia's support of Bashar Assad's regime.
In a phone call to the head of the Russian MID, Sergey Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, warned that Russia’s support for Syrian President Bashar Assad was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad risked exacerbating and exacerbating the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of fighting extremism, if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power,” states a report on the US State Department's website.
Kerry reaffirmed the US's commitment to the fight against the Islamic State (the activities of which are prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of over 60 states.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad "can never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Also during the phone call, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can be resolved only through a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of support for the Assad regime.
The White House Spokesman Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation the day before, unless it stopped supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest has proposed joining an international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
In recent times, the media have often reported the presence of Russian troops on Syrian territory.
To which the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, has claimed that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and have been helping the Syrians to master the technology to use it against Islamists.
Four people died when the police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal, when the police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution, as the official announced on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in Rupandei County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country's capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the head of the district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters had met at one of the police stations, and some had thrown rocks and arson bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police used tear gas, and then shot in the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, have led to such high mortality, but have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative.
This clash was the last in a few weeks of violent protests in the southern, plainland part of Nepal, where the Madesi people claim that the new provinces created by the new constitution will diminish their political influence.
Protests have also taken place in the west of Nepal, among the Tararu people who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
On August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into a province, a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been under way since 2008, but the legislature has hastened the process after a devastating earthquake that claimed thousands of lives in April.
The legislators voted in favour of the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials announced that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk is planning to set up an enterprise for 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in Irkutsk.
It was built in the 1970s as a center of the chemical industry, with a well-developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Saiyansk led the new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
He presented the results of the first year of work, new projects and prospects to the Regional Correspondent.
Oleg Valerjevich, how did you start your job as mayor?
I first read the results of the financial and business audits, and initiated an independent audit of the local budget.
This was followed by an audit of municipal property.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the volume of work to five days.
In the past, court records can go for months.
Steps have been taken to increase the profit base and to optimize the cost.
Last November, a Government retreat was held in Sayansk to address the economic and social development of the Territory.
The city did not have any design and design document (PPA) for any site.
Without this, Sayansk could not take part in federal programs.
We began with the preparation of POJA for roads, day care, a northern sewer, and a water drain.
Roadworks on two sites are under way.
How is the Russian President's decree on the construction of kindergartens being implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
This positive demography has not been observed in the city for the last 27 years.
So the issue of providing places in day care today is one of the most relevant.
Since 1 September, it has been closed down for major repairs to kindergarten No. 10 for 320 places.
The estimated cost of the repairs is 86 million roubles.
So far, the city has never received such funds.
Last year, a day care centre No. 23 was set up, and 200 children are now attending.
The renovation was co-financed from the regional and local budgets, costing more than 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional Government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment have been secured, and the People's Initiatives programme has also helped.
There are plans to start the construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the rank of children between the ages of one and a half and three.
We don't have 3-7-year-olds.
Are the investors interested in the Territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction of the city is to be done, first and foremost, by the Sayan enterprises, and that it is to be done by them.
Already in October, a 60-bedroom orphaned children ' s home in the Leningrad district is being put into operation.
With regard to construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangarya, which is part of the program for the construction of an economy class.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
In all, we have announced the construction of 10,000 m2 of housing for those who want to be part of the program.
One of the conditions is that the dwelling must not be more than 30,000 roubles per square metre, and this cost includes a “key-to-key”.
If we get through the set levels, we'll continue to be part of the program.
As far as investors are concerned, we have other interesting projects.
In time, the Sayan Pork Complex was built on the Territory, which was sold at no cost in 2004.
We're working with the D.A. to protest this deal.
Especially since the land under the object is in federal property.
Work is under way with Moscow, the transfer of 88 ha to regional property, and the transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor who is ready to invest 1.5 billion roubles in the reconstruction and start-up of the project.
We're gonna have 900 jobs with a pig-to-peak fire, which will be a big help to the city.
Is there an institution of social partnership in Sayansk?
We have some 140 social and economic partnership treaties.
A number of projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Enterprises such as the East Centre, the New Zealand Tec, the Sayan Broyler, the PC of the IDF, and the management of these enterprises respond to all requests, are providing tangible support.
Directly in the day of the OLG, the Sayan Broyler donated to the city a town of children, and East Central renovated a horseyard, where specialists are dealing with the children of the paediatrics, costing more than 1 million roubles.
Sponsored funds have helped to support the city's state-of-the-art.
Sponsors have helped to celebrate City Day in a colorful way.
As in the old days, there was a parade involving city groups and organizations.
The history of the city, a book of Saiyan poets, was published.
The originals and the people who have made a major contribution to the development of Sayansk have been given the Jubilee Medals.
The Mecenates also participate in the City Charitable Fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, over 800,000 roubles have been used to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive care, and to support children from low-income families.
How are human resources problems in the social sphere being addressed in Sayansk?
The city has a shortage of medical and pedagogical personnel.
In order to address the human resource issue, the provision of housing for professionals is of great importance.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, and four teachers have been assigned to the office.
We have a housing programme with the option to privatize it in five years.
Plans are to remodel the building, which will have eight more apartments for educators.
Teachers and doctors are also involved in the "Life for the Russian Family" program.
In the long run, the building of a house for the budget sector.
Most importantly, the city has a working team with which I can deal with the most complex issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
The Duma has introduced a bill on the indexation of sociales, taking into account the rise in prices.
A bill has been tabled in the State Duma to index social pensions every year since 1 February, taking into account the rise in prices.
The author of the document, Alexander Lomakin-Romantsen, a member of Fair Russia, also proposes an additional indexation of pensions on 1 April, if the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum is higher than the rate of growth in the prices of goods and services.
Indications of social benefits under the current law have been made every year from 1 April, taking into account the rate of growth of the pensioner ' s subsistence minimum in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The bill to the lower house provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions, taking into account the rate of growth in consumer prices.
The first indexation is postponed to 1 February and the second is held on 1 April.
The head of the OSCE PA has told Mogerini not to impose sanctions on Parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogerini, the Speaker of the OSCE PA, Ilka Kanerva, declared that there should be no sanctions against the legislators participating in the Assembly.
A member of the Russian delegation to the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar, Nikolai Kovalev, informed the press.
According to TASS, the signatures of European Parliamentarians, including the representatives of Cyprus, Germany, France, Italy, Greece, have been collected in support of the Kanerva position.
"Sufficient support has already developed," said Kovalev.
He had previously stated that the head of the OSCE PA had intended to collect the signatures of the deputies, who had indicated that no sanctions against Parliamentarians should be imposed.
In particular, Kovalev noted that Kanerva had promised to raise the issue to the level of EU leadership and to “send the relevant petition”.
NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Green Cape is 60%.
The wide front of the low-pressure area is about 350 miles (560 km) south of the south end of the Green Cape Islands, with 60 per cent likely to become a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, reported on Tuesday by the United States National Hurricane Center.
Another well-defined low-pressure area in the middle between the Green Cape and the Small Antillean Islands also has a 60 per cent chance of a tropical cyclone in the next two days, reports synoptics from Miami.
Google is running a double-dollar campaign to raise $11 million for the refugees.
Google Inc (GOGL.O) has launched a double-dollar campaign to raise 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations to help infiltrate European refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has taken an uncharacterized personal approach by announcing a donation campaign on his blog.
Instead of making a statement, Google employee Rita Masood, who ran away with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We've been on dubious trains and buses, suffering hunger, thirst, cold, and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has intensified, so many people like my family are desperately in need of help.
Donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations working to assist refugees and migrants: “Physicians without Borders”, the International Salvation Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google announced that it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until the sum on google.com/refugeerelief reached $11 million.
Europe has been facing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, which has been the result of most of Syria’s four-year civil war, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing from war-torn Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.

Diabetes with small obesity can be helped by obesity surgery
The positive effect of obesity surgery on people with small obesity, type 2 diabetes, can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that diabetics with small obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive nonsurgery.
"Death statistics don't show up immediately," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who wrote about a new study in the column of the JAMA Surgery editor.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of the organization to absorb food.
For a few years, bariatric surgery has proved to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but the main studies have been carried out among people with morbid obesity, with an index of body mass (IMT) 35 or more.
The IMT, the weight relative to growth, is considered normal at 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or more indicates that a person is overweight, and people with IMTs over 30 are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital used data from 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - bypassing the stomach and sleeve gistrectomy, with type 2 type of diabetic treatment for people with low obesity.
The average value of IMTs for those who have been subjected to surgical intervention fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, those who have received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remain at about 29.
Of the people who had undergone the surgery, 36 per cent had been completely cured of diabetes, and 28 per cent had been partially cured.
In the group receiving medicinal treatment, for comparison, there was only 1% full cure of diabetes, and only about 2% partial cure.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LPNP cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group”, the authors state.
Researchers also controlled blood hemoglobin levels of A1c, which reflect blood sugar levels in a dynamic way.
Hemoglobin A1c is best held below 7%, by researchers.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin level of A1c fell from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8%.
But the best Glycemic control, as reflected by the good levels of hemoglobin A1c, has not reduced the mortality rate in five years, according to Dr. Chi-Chang Soo, the head of research, and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, the bypass group lost more than a weight (18.7 kg as opposed to 14.2 kg) in comparison with the sleeve gistrectomy group, was more likely to reduce MMTs (7.4 kg as against 5.1) and A1c hemoglobin (3.1 % as against 2.1 %) and was closer to a full remission of diabetes (46.9 % as against 16.7 %).
Although the new study does not show the benefits of a surgical method in life after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment does result in an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone of the College of Medicine in Phoenix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for obese people who chose bariatric intervention, the probability of dying for 15 years was about 29% lower than that of a group with more traditional methods.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this is encouraging people with IMTs below 35 who are interested in such a procedure.
“The report is very important here, as it states that such surgery is safe in a group with low IMTs, where there is no higher risk of death or renal disease”, she stated.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient's IMT falls between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to get people to take it seriously," she said.
I think it's very hard to reverse the genetic changes that cause obesity and diabetes in their bodies.
In the Washhouses, the robbers removed their fur coats and 9 million roubles.
In the Washhouses, the robbers attacked the residents of the Moscow house and stole 9 million rubles and three women ' s coats.
Interfax informs this with a reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
The two unknowns, through an open front door, entered a house on Gorky Street, tie up the 20-year-old son of the owner of the house, and threatened both with a knife, and stole 9 million roubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of the damage was 9,265,000 roubles, and a criminal case was brought under the heading “Cruciality”.
European fans are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 peterburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to the World Cup in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to get permission.
According to experts, this is a very worrisome sign.
In the run-up to world supremacy, the authorities will have to find a way to displace all the city's guests.
The interviewers in Rosbalt believe that the competition will make the rent of the leases 10 to 30 per cent higher, and after the renditions, the rent will have to be overpaid.
The World Cup made the authorities look at the condition of the Russian hotels.
By law, which has been written specifically for the first place, every Hotel in St. Petersburg has to pass the classification procedure and prove that it is in line with the number of stars and the level of the service.
Even now, it is clear that not all will be able to do so: Hotels are so afraid of testing that they often do not even send documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for St. Petersburg.
According to UFA head Vadim Vladimirov, the agency has studied 138 hotels and is now planning to start 34 hotels, many of which have simply not responded to the anti-monoperators.
There are signs that three dozen companies have been defrauded by the city, with some number of stars in the ads, by Vladimirov.
The problem is, right now, there's literally every number on the table, and no one can be lost before 2018.
The officials suspect that during the football championship, the fans will be occupying all the Peterburg Hotels.
Now, in the city, tourists can count on 30,000 rooms.
According to Smolny, there are 17 five-star hotels in St. Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, and 550 single-star hotels.
According to Nana Gwichia, the First Deputy Tourism Development Committee, so far only 23 hotels have been classified, so much of the checks have been carried out by companies accredited in St. Petersburg.
And if any of the hotels ordered a similar procedure from a regional company, it's not known if it's in a surprising way.
I mean, there may be more classifiers, but no one knows about it.
"For the last six months, the hotels have not been very keen to be classified," admitted the director of the North-West Office of the Russian Touring Union, Catherine Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season, during which hotels make the most money and do not want to do other business.
Another reason is the budgets that do not have the cost of testing, and the procedure can be used by the hotel, depending on the status of 30 to 100,000 roubles or more.
However, in recent years, the hotel managers have intensified and started to apply for classification, assured Shadskaya.
Hotels have to make it by 1 July 2016, or they will not only pay the fine, but will also not have the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the starry, a fixed hotel fee will be developed for the duration of the tournament.
The formulas on which the cost will be calculated will be made public next year.
This is done to prevent the price of 200-300% up, as is the case, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience, and you don't want a two-to-three-time promotion, but the hotels have to make a living.
"I think it'll be up to 50%," explained the president of the Russian Hotel Association Gennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimirov, in turn, is not sure that price fixing is in line with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much it fits into economic theory, but I hope it's justifiable.
"That's better than an unbridled journey," he remarked.
It's not clear what's gonna happen to the popular cheap hostels.
Members of the State had submitted a bill to prohibit hostels in homes.
We very much hope that this law will not be passed or will not be applied to St. Petersburg.
"We're going to stand up for the view that hostels should be kept," Nana Gavácia says.
However, according to her, the owners of the mini-hotels should in any event be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma finally approves the bill, there will be about 80 per cent of the hostels in St. Petersburg, and there are currently 1,500 rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of Restorers and Hotels of North-West Leonid Garbar, there is a lack of two or three-star hotels in St.
This is the same as when "the 80000th Stadium has 75,000 vips."
This can be corrected at the expense of mini-hotels.
Their possible ban is considered an "idiotism" by an expert: "I think it's strange that some people can live in apartments, but some people don't. "
If the hostel is used as a dorm, I agree it's wrong.
But if it's like a hotel where the guests come for a short time, why not?
Mini-hospitals risk skipping the World Cup because of their slowness.
Hundreds of small hotels just won't be able to get classed, and they're digging a hole for themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all the city's hotels will be booked.
“Companies that can run this procedure are not much, so they will give up less-paid mini-hotel orders, but will choose the ones that are more expensive,” remarked Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the level of the checks that have been carried out to date is much higher than that of the Peterburgers.
The reason for the Paterburg delay was due, inter alia, to the constant changes in the Government ' s tourism block, which did not help to work in a coherent manner.
According to experts, if there are not enough hotels in peterburg, it is likely that attention will have to be paid to the regional hotels and rest homes.
Like the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, a river fleet can be mobilized into the city, so the hosts of the tournament can live in their quarters.
And a lot of the fans will be ready to come in the vans where they can sleep.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels to be emptied," I'm sure Gennady Lamshin.
It will also be very popular at the time of the football first.
The city is more likely to have a reserve of rental apartments.
The lease rate will be 10-30%.
"Of the obvious, the first to leave a place near the stadium," remarked a specialist in the Agency for Development and Real Estate Research, Larissa Bragina.
And the rent may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in the dormitory.
The construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city would also help, she stressed.
Let us not forget the human qualities of the city.
For example, Leonid Garbart is convinced that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city in which people not just point the way, but can also conduct a mini-excursion.
There are also complications.
My dad met a family in the courtyard in 1970 from Murmansk, a father, a mother, and two children.
They didn't have a place to sleep. The hotels were hard, and it was hard to sleep at the station.
"And my dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," he remembered.
True, he has added that there is no such thing left in the city now - to call his home would have consequences and terrible consequences.
But in 2018, after the failure of the State's decisions, the mistakes of the hotels, and the government, we might have to remember the past.
Girinovsky "sille" of the Amur oblast.
I was fascinated to see Girinowski's clown in the State Department today.
He did things like this when our generation was just learning how to sell newspapers, and he's still in excellent shape.
The theme of the presentation is, like, a “protest of the LDPR against the results of the elections in the Amur Region”.
The protocols do not shake - for nothing; there are no other protocols, other than those signed by the berms, that the LDPR does not seem to have.
Here he picks up Ivan Abramov's second place and yells like, "Here's the winner of the election!"
And right now, it's all over Rodnine, and then, after a fight with the president, it pulls the faction out of the conference room, yelling, literally, "You're all with the fronts of your crooks and thieves."
The press is, of course, not focused on Abramov, but on the faction's scandal and demarcation as a result of this scandal and insult.
In fact, Wolfowicz spilled the Amur oblast in a beautiful and elegant way, along with Abramov.
For the country as a whole, it's another "Podny" gyrinovsky, not a protest by a political party against the results of a particular election.
Both the faction formally scanned, and the elections, according to the Party's website and Facebook of Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader of the subject is clearly falling.
Offers to the dead in Amura to bury their dead themselves, while he gives the good news to the One of Russia in general, and to the innocent Rodnine in no way.
It's a delightful decision not to lose a face, not a real scandal.
The other thing is, now Abraham himself is in a strange position.
He didn't wait for anything but his boss's yelling, and there's no alternative protocol in his hand.
He is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other, for a narrow circle, he is the formal reason for insulting a respected champ, and, even more, the cham hits on EP and FNF.
And here, of course, he has to think hard about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the election, the number two of the region, and the number one candidate for the only single regional district, it can turn into a parish that has been successfully shared by its own party leadership and super-demonstrant for the same UNF and the party leadership of the other.
I'm sure it wouldn't have been Girinovsky, but he'd have to think of it and watch it with respect.
The trump is still growing up to it.
The news is that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next prisoner.
So the bath fell out of nowhere.
The subject of Abram was the only one that was buried under it.
It's really pretty.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot receive all the refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to the violence in the home countries.
The Dalai Lama referred to the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center of Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to the study of ethics, at the start of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that, in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be higher than those of individual countries or even of continents.
He also stressed that, while it was admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It's not possible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria for their response to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“The care of thousands of refugees is excellent, but at the same time you must also think about durable solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries,” he stressed.
After all, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We need to weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
On the subject of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the US’s strong response had led to a chain of unsupervised events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to the problem was possible through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have swallowed disinfectant for their hands in the last 4 years
The United States toxicology centres have reported an increase of almost 400 per cent since 2010, in the number of children under 12 who have swallowed high-alcohol disinfectant hands, according to the Georgia State Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gailord Lopez, director of the Georgia State Toxicology Center, the cases of child-absorbed hand-disinfected liquids reported to the toxicology centres rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are in contact with these substances more often, and unfortunately some of them go to the E.R.," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some kids drink disinfectant liquid on purpose, and some do it to impress their friends, or to argue for social media.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking disinfectant liquid as a cheap drink.
Youngsters are reported to have blended disinfectant liquid with a liquor-shaping liquid to get a more strong drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the good smells of disinfectant liquid.
"The kid doesn't think it's gonna hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand-disinfectant) are those that are scented.
There are disinfectant hand fluids with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
The disinfectant hand liquid contains about 45 to 95 per cent of the alcohol.
Young children, in particular, have few dispersals that can cause alcohol poisoning.
"This is a high-concentration alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, Chief Doctor of the Poison Center at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave a shot of whiskey, but people keep this disinfectant for their hands, and if the kids get to it, it's a fast way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a decontamination device for her hands with a strawberry scent of about four sprays, was sent to the E.R. for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who was legally intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett health centre near Atlanta.
Naija confused her words and was unable to walk when she was taken to the E.R.
Doctors watched her all night at a separate children's clinic to keep track of any sign of a brain injury, as the girl fell down and hit her head, told Ritchie.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Naigi's mother.
It could have been fatal to my kid.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-pirate or disinfectant napkins, in addition to removing disinfectant hand fluids from the child ' s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant liquids are linked to death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, not ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three four-year-olds in the North of New York conspired to poison their "opposing" teacher by "distributing anti-bacterial substances in the class", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to arm disinfectors, and she's not allowed to keep them in her class.
The police believe the failure of the plan was a "empty talk" and address the subject of discipline to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the end of the N.K. Krupsky children ' s library, the iron owl is saddened.
The kids who come for the books are trying to feed her candy.
For a number of generations, he has been in the library for 95 years.
The first readers in the 20th century used to make a big read here, play on the verses of Mayakovsky, perform a literary quiz, and write with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted for four years, and as The Young Staller wrote in 1939, “the friendship between the hope of Constantine Kruppskaya and the friends of the Barnaul Children's Library was getting stronger every day.
The hope of Constantine even sent out a picture of her child to a distant Barnaul friend.
And when the Barnauls asked if hope of Constantinoovna would object to the library's naming her name, he said no, no.
Letters have long been saturated in the museum, and the grandchildren of the first readers have to explain to them whose strict profile decorates the library building.
In the years of restructuring, a number of people called, resented: Why is the children’s library not being renamed?
Let's have a library of the name of some good kids' writer, no political color!
The staff of the library sat down, thought, and decided to leave it as it was.
"Cruscian" is perhaps the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, as a "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library hall is a track of yellow brick.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is Oli Moscow's favorite theme.
Olya used to be the manager of a law firm, she came to work at 8:00, she left at 5:00, and all the other managers were very fond of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet, "I need an imager for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Chancer Mommy" -- "My mom has cancer."
Olya made the illustrations, and thought, life can end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it if you don't make it yourself.
Now she works in the library, she illustrates the children's books of writers all over the world, and she writes fairytales herself.
Traditionally, it is believed that children lose interest in the book, that they are living in some virtual space...
But we have kids who are reading, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, "The Russian Planet," says Tatiana Kuszvid, director of the library.
In recent years, we even have a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed, and it will live - the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
There's a big, up-to-date photography display in the library lobby.
Every quarter, new photographs of readers who go to the library as a family are displayed: mom, dad, and kids.
The library is glad to see more and more popes with their children.
If the child is two years old and has been read all over Chukowski, he needs more books at a later age.
But there's a law in place that bans an eight-year-old from making books out of category 12+.
To get a book like this, a kid has to bring his parents in -- they come in, they come back again, and eventually "Cruscian" becomes something like a family club for them.
There's a treasure in the library-- a pre-revolutionary collection of barleys and eras, to show Coronenko in an app to "Niva", a 1936 "Murzylki" embroidery.
We're not just the conceptual space of the Book's Temple, we're open to movement, we're trying to become a special place -- not a home, not a job, not a school -- Tatiana Kuszvid.
You can come to us to read, to play, to draw.
We've made a play zone for the kids - the kid just comes to play, and the hand is still reaching for the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they are stifling with their legs, and they don't want to leave.
Mothers often come with carts -- and we're glad that the library is the first place to go with the kids.
Tatiana Kuszvid says, "Today's kids, like we used to love classical children's literature:
"The publisher's case is under way, and a lot of attention is being paid to the authors, who are the inter-generational link."
And when we talk about little kids, it's important for them to be some kind of hero who travels from one book to the next.
Kids don't like to break up with their heroes.
The library regularly publishes tracts for parents, explaining what is happening in modern children’s literature, what books are worth looking at, and why.
Booklets are so intriguing and intriguing that adults are also interested, but this library is not for them.
It's illegal for adults to take books out of the reading hall.
Only children have this magical privilege.
...in the nearest library room there's a square hatch with an old wooden staircase in the basement, in the Bookshop.
Steps will be squeaking under your feet - it's a very old time machine.
You're seeing your childhood book like an old friend: hi, it's good you and I don't change.
Ally's still walking on the track with a yellow brick, the lazy Tola Reddies stealing the magic match, and the boy-kibalcish never told the damn Bourgeois of the War Privy, so he has a solid word.
Books like passwords can be used anywhere to get to know one's own.
There's a real book-scene in the vault, like a pre-revolutionary collection of eggs and eras.
Or take Coronenko in a famous app to the Niwa Magazine.
Or a 1936 Muzzle embroidery.
Time has aged the pages, colored them in tea.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are the fragments of our future collection, and I'm still dreaming of getting a pension and doing a few children's books.
But the kids won't do it, so to speak, and the colors in the old books aren't very bright, and the theme is... you open the front page, and there's Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now it's like, why did we all write out this Pioneer Truth?
But it was still interesting, "The Russian Planet" by Galina Ilyasov, the head of the Bookshop.
The pages of the Murzilki are getting dark from time to time.
Galina Vassiljevna has been in charge of the library for her entire life.
She knows the color of Buratino's cap, in which school year Harry Potter became the captain of the Gryffindor team at the Quidditch Cup, in which Carlson uses a silencing device for a motor, and what Alice Silenceny's father is doing.
The librarian pays very little for his work, and everyone who can live without these book rows is very quick to find another profession.
Only the most convinced are the educators, the educators, the worshipers of the book.
You can also learn from a smile - it's a professional feature of a child librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation, it's a professional.
I do love children's books: as a librarian, I like them to be on the shelves, and I love to read 'em,' says Galina Vasilievna.
I read all: military, historical, fairytale, fantastic.
Reading modern Russian writers, new translations...
Of course, I think it was different when I was a kid.
The books were the most exciting and exciting thing that ever happened to me.
And since I loved them crazy, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be despite the Riders.
And I'm glad when our former readers bring our kids, or even grandchildren...
Rumor mill: There's no disagreement in the Celtics.
Griffiths disproved the chatter at the Celtic after Dale's admission that Hops was in a bad position, but he'll fix it.
Harts will protest against the Scotland Football Association's claim to Neilson, and Warberton is afraid to sign a contract in January, which may disrupt the team's unity.
"Dons" has increased the advantage of Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's first-time penalty gave Aberdeen a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittodri, which allowed Dons to break off Celtic by five points.
Griffiths disproved the talk of discord.
This led to rumours of disagreements in the Celtics, which were cut off by Griffiths, who claimed that he and his teammates were not suffering from any increased criticism in preparation for a meeting with the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we're feeling the strain, I think the players want it.
The Dutch are bored, because the Scots are not in the race for the title - de Boer
A former part-time defender from Rangers and a former member of the Netherlands team, Ronald de Boer, stated that the Dutch football fans had lost interest in the Celtic, as he was not competing for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently a representative of Ayaxa, said, "In Holland, the most attractive moments of the Celtic game are no longer shown, why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
The people here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of stress in the Old Company game, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see it.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronny Dale admitted that Celtic was going through a lot of trouble, but the Norwegian coach vowed to make a difference.
The defeat of Malmö and, as a result, the exit from the League of Champions was soon followed by the loss of 10 Aberdeen footballers, who are now at the top of the table after five points.
But Dale said, "The Slithet has had bad times before, and we'll go out again."
Now we want to get out of this as fast as we can.
I know it's very sad, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
And so do we, but we have to go on.
And we really, really need Celtic support, because that makes the players much better.
Staying together is so important right now.
Warberton, with distrust, is waiting for the January transfers.
Despite the opinions that appeared just a few weeks ago, suggesting that he had identified some of the objectives of the January transfers, the Rangers boss Mark Warberton has distrusted the January campaign, claiming that he does not want to destroy the unity of the team.
The former attacker of "Brentford" said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the beginning of the season to adapt to them, as you saw in our own band this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Michu, who is interested in Celtic, hinted at the end of his career.
Assailant Suonsey Michu, linked to the Celtic during the transfer window, insinuated that he could leave football after his Swans contract was over.
A 29-year-old player had an ankle problem for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
The Harts are going to stand up to the SFA about Neilson's statements.
The Harts led with a 2:1 account when Patterson was removed, and began to play 3:2, but the red card was later cancelled; it was the third red Collum card, which was cancelled in eight months.
Nelson won't give up on what he said, saying, "I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tynxall.
The hard-working player of the Hybernian team was reprimanded after he admitted to sing a song with insulting words about former Harts player Rudy Skacella.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, just before the Edinburgh Derby in Tyncastle in March 2014.
"It was derbys, and it was hot," said the attacker, adding, "I can say with confidence I didn't want to go back to Tyncastle if he didn't play for Celtic.
Donnelly: The Tannadis Council is confident in the management of Dundee United.
Simon Donnelly states that the Dundee United Board of Directors is still confident that the management team will make a difference, but agrees that the deterioration in the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the kids out again," said Donnelly.
McInnes is glad he won the Hamilton bad game.
Derek McKinness admitted that his team, Aberdeen, had to fight desperately against "Hamilton Assis", to win the seventh in a row in the league, which put them five points above the Celtics, top of the table, thanks to Adam Rooney's first-time penalty.
McInness said, "There's no team here to win something, a cup, or a league championship, who didn't win a meeting like this."
The rate of unemployment among Scots is not changing, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is on the rise.
THE unemployment rate in Scotland was 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher than that in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as the National Statistics Service (ONS) figures show.
At the same time, Scotland ' s employment has fallen by 12,000 in three months, with 2,612,000 now working.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent a quarter, up from an average of 73.5 per cent in the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Minister, David Mandel, commenting on the most recent figures, said: "The Government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It has been almost a year since Scotland made a historic decision to stay in the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in Scotland's labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Why am I a witness to the execution in Oklahoma?
Today, by evading legal intervention at a later stage, I will watch a man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting at the death row gallery in Oklahoma State, when Richard Glossip is executed with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The first request was made in January, through a close friend of his, and while I was in shock, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to fear.
So why do it?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since there are often more people than places, the results of the gloomy lottery decide who will be selected.
In Oklahoma, the number of press places was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I'm gonna sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and he and I have a relationship after a few months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk to him.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I'm not gonna be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'm gonna have to try to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me of tweeting my own impartiality.
It's a lesson.
Tell the inmate's story the way he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have better spelled it out myself," but she still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he was talking.
I told him he could cross me off his witness list anytime.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that transparency will help the abolitionist movement.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I wrote down.
I'm not gonna go into detail here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is not guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treise make him guilty of abetting the crime.
But I believe there's a big chance he's not guilty of murder.
I'm pretty sure there was not enough evidence for the death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this point of view, I'm gonna watch him die.
I can't say I'll be completely objective.
There will be other reporters who can be contacted for this.
You'll learn from me what it's like to watch a man I like die without need.
A man chased by the police has been persuaded to get out of the Cunning River.
The constable from Cunning Vale managed to get a man out of the Cunning River and stay dry.
Perth was about to leave the police, but he was not able to find himself in the filthy water in the shallow water a few meters from a police officer who was trying to "smartly talk him out of shore."
Cunning Vale Police was called on Tuesday for illegal entry into other territory in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them by hurling off to Cunning.
But it didn't go far.
"He was standing in the water and saying, "I will not go out, come on, grab me," said Sergeant Sgt. Sandell Castledyne.
PC Lachlan Perhavetsu didn't really want to wet his uniform, so he used a more secure way of doing "talking with a good cop."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," says Sergeant Sergeant Castledyne.
That's what Ben Cazins, a footballer, remembers.
In 2006, Cazins moved to a quail to avoid a meeting with a police patrol to test for alcohol, and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts proved to be in vain, but led the locals to invent a funny "Ben Kazin's" biatlon.
Peter Moody is blaming stewards for trying to spy and threatening to leave the horse sport.
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria of trying to infiltrate a spy in his stable last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
He was targeted by stewards and members of Racing Victoria's Ethics Department, who he accused of running a campaign against him in person, and de-launching Lady Tatai for violating the rules for the use of drugs on the day of launch, on Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he's always making every effort to take part in the races, and he's in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of the Lydari-to-cobalt test, which he can't explain.
He kept his tongue on the suspicion of spying for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look like green grapes.
"I wasn't gonna say anything about it, and I've been through it for a long time, but sometimes it's so out of your mind that you don't hold back," said Moody.
They know it's been going on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to face the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep tight.
I want to go with my head up high, and I want my owners to know I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think it's not, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Moody made a sensational statement earlier during an interview at racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his stable.
"A half a year ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown, and Dr. Brian Stuart sat in a room with a man I'm gonna call if they ask, and offered him a job in my stable to give information about what I'm doing in my stable," said Moody at Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a con man.
If so, they should all make a statement, as they failed to catch me.
Robert Rollston, the former Chairman of RVL, David Moody, the current Chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, the External Executive Director of RVL, knew about it all the time and now know it.
Shouldn't it make me think it's getting personal?
Shouldn't RVL have the courage to hold up and hold people responsible for what's going on in this business other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I that bad for this profession?
Maybe the people in there think that's what it is.
Maybe they should take my license and push me out, and I don't doubt what I'm talking about can make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and it saddens me.
I'm really sad about it.
I will put pressure on them and hold them responsible for the decision.
I have family support, and I can go.
The coach's resentment was only raised in a long-term investigation into the case of Kobalt and Lidari, and the last withdrawal of the horse from the start made him say he could "shull his license on the table."
Moody, the best-known one for the unfailing Black Caviar Champion, called the requirements for the use of medication on the day of the competition "smart" after the horse was put on its legs with a compress of clay, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules at the races.
"I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put a compress on her leg.
She could have got a compress last night.
She could have got it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him the day of the race.
Moody can be disqualified for three months under the rules for the use of medication on the day of the compress competition, for which the stewards have opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all know we need the rules, but it has gone too far," said Moody.
The driver who hit and escaped from the Cobram incident was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobram this weekend and ran off the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car in Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man in the city of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene, not providing assistance, and other traffic regulations.
A motorcyclist, 40-year-old in Cobrama, stays at the hospital in a stable state.
Coach "Melbourne Storm" Craig Bellamy's posing as a rival for the use of strong force.
Coach "Melbourne Storm" Craig Bellamy called the criticism of the ball's interception by his team as the "fixing the agenda" by the two winners of the NRL championship.
Coach "Sydney Roosters" Martin Robinson stated that the judges allowed Storm "to fight" with his team during the sudden victory of "Storm" at the final of the Sydney qualifying game on Friday night.
Coach "Brisbane Broncos" Wayne Bennett made a clear hint on "The Storm" after his team won the finals of the "Normal Queensland Cowboys" match on Saturday night, when he called this game "typical" for the Rugby League and said that two of Queensland's team were not "too successful" in a hand-to-hand fight.
Bellamy defended the ball with his team and said that they were just focused on the contact by seizing the ball.
Bellamy added that he was convinced by the criticism of his team by the two top coaches, which means they're worried about the possible defeat of the Storm.
"This keeps popping up -- I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about the hard stuff when they beat us with a 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can bet we haven't changed anything in our defense systems for a year, just in the last six weeks, we've focused on contacting the ball, and it's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been out there for three years, and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how it always manifests at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of an "impressive football" by reminding his teacher that "St. George-Illavarra Dragons" Bennett won the 2010 championship with "smart" football.
Wayne's talking about catching football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was," Bellamy remarked.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was critical, calling it a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care at all.
But now he's got a team that can show what he thinks is an impressive football, especially his young semi-defendants at their speed.
It's a football game you'd want to play when you have such a player.
He made this point in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style -- not every team has two half-defendants like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play it like that.
It gives me more confidence, because they say these things, because they're a bit concerned about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to the big game.
Bellamy also noted that the game of "Storma" and "Rusters" was a match with more points than the game of "Broncos" and "Cowboys".
The "Broncos" game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game, it was 8:18, there were two more shots - and what, this is an impressive football?
Or do you think the breaks and the failure to try are impressive?
For me, it's a routine.
If they mention us, it means we can meet them there at some point.
"Storma" has a weekend off at the end of this week, as they have won the right to receive either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Kronalla Sharks next Saturday night at the pre-finals at the AAMI Park Stadium, the tickets will be on the market next Tuesday morning.
Charged for possession of drugs, the Serb is on bail for $200,000.
A man facing life imprisonment for trying to embezzle 40 kg of coke smuggled to Queensland was released on bail at $200,000.
Marco Maximovic, 29, is one of the five people arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drugs on a Solay yacht from South America via Vanuatu and was moored in Coomer in August.
All morning, Maximovic and his associates were seen at the docks, and later he met with them at the Comera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in a Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maximovic is facing a life sentence for trying to sell enough drugs, counsel for Maximovich states that there is no proof that the latter was trying to get the whole shipment, and that the man could have been in the cafe without any intent.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
In the course of the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Mothers and stepfathers of Maximovich have been asked to make a joint pledge of $200,000 for his release.
"It is clear from both statements that the amount of $200,000's bail is too much of a financial burden for them," remarked Judge Flanagan.
But this alone is not enough as a guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovic was allowed to be released on bail on the condition that he would hand in both his Australian and Serbian passport, report to the police daily and observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
"Fotis Katsicaris: "I'm mad at the Hellenic team, which has been fighting for the last few seconds."
==History==Greek's main coach, Fotis Cacicaris, paid tribute to his team after the 1/4 Eurobasket 2015 match with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was determined by a number of errors.
It was a big game, quotes AFP Cacicaris.
We've been getting ready for a great Spanish game.
We've tried to work in the defense, but the defense's failure has determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They've been fighting for the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I'm going to take over Kauna's functions in the CSKA."
The CSK's newest man, Joel Freeland, said he didn't believe in the curse of the Army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroliga next season.
I spoke to Coach Dimitris Itudis a few times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, quotes Freeland's R-Sport.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to re-engineer the center position, but I was more of a forward in the NBA.
Now we're gonna have to face up to the big center of the rival, but I've done this before, so I think I'm gonna do it right now.
The army won the Euroliga for the last time in 2008.
Since then, they've made it to the Final Four six times, but they can't show their best basketball every time.
There's a feeling someone jinxed the team.
That's the game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's hard, I get the frustration of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we're going to show the best we can do, we have a good chance to win the Euro league, I do think so.
I've always wanted to win this title, and the Moscows have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the SCCA.
As for the jinx, I am not a superstitious man, and I do not believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you put these two things together, it's all possible.
I don't have any specific rites before the game, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as I can.
Louis Henriquet: "For me, a match with "Roma" will be a special one."
The Chief Coach of the Barcelonas, Luis Henrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the 1st Tour of the League of Champions with a special sense.
According to the mentor, the face-to-face match of his current and former team would be far from normal for him.
Let us recall that Luis Henrique trained the “wolves” in the 2011–12 season, but failed to show himself to the best in Italy's capital.
I went back to Rome a few years later, for which I gained some experience.
I have a very warm memory with Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that big of a deal.
The main thing is to start in the League of Champions with a win.
The Augustus meeting at the John Gamper Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the next match.
I'm looking forward to the "Roma" game she's shown in the "A" series against "Juventus."
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: The "Redger" has various options for attacking."
Acting Chief Coach of Ural, Vadim Skripchenko, in the run-up to the 9th Tour of the Premier League with the "Crasnodar" noted the variety of attacking schemes of the rival team.
According to the mentor, "bows" have a number of models of attack in their arsenal.
The match will take place on 21 September and will start at 4:30 in Moscow time.
How do we play with "The Red Man," and let's see, it's the official "Urala" website of the Scriptchenko.
We've got a week ahead of us.
This team has all sorts of attack options, and it's doing a lot of it, and we're not slow, so I think it's gonna be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given the fact that the Krasnodar is running a League of Europe match against the Dorthmund "Boroussia", we will try to be very well prepared to win.
Rocher Cañas: "Astana House can take the glasses from anyone."
After the 1st Tour of the League of Champions with the Benfica (0:2), he expressed confidence in the quality of his team's game in the future.
In the view of the hawbek, in their field, the astonishers are able to take points from any opponent.
Even though the match was hard for us, I can say we played well, and it's the official UEFA Web site of Kanyas's words.
"Benfica" is up in class, but in a home game, I think we can count on taking their glasses.
It's pretty real.
But first we need to think about Galatasarea, and then we need to think about Atletico.
We can pick up points from everyone in the home game.
Raphael Benitez: "I'll do it all the time: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world."
Raphael Benitez, the Chief Trainer of Reals, expressed his satisfaction at the major win in the 1st Tour of the League of Champions with the Souther (4:0).
The expert paid tribute to forward Cristian Ronald, who was the author of the three heads.
The match was not easy, because "Shooter" knows how to control the ball, which is the official UEFA Web site of Benitez's word.
The opponent didn't have a lot of moments, but their counterattacks are always dangerous.
I'm not gonna say the Real was perfect, but we've had a lot of shots.
I'm glad we didn't miss the ball and hit four.
Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his level.
It's the best player in the world, I'll say it all the time.
Jordy Alba: "Cristiano Ronald can't match Messi."
"Barcelons" by Jordy Alba believes that no one can compare to his single-timer, Lionel Massey.
According to the Spaniard, forward "Real" to Cristiano Ronald can't do it either.
Messy's five heads above the others, quotes Le Figaro Albu.
Not even Cristiano Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field, things change, I can't compare it to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: Barcelona has not only a unique style, but also a bright identity.
The Roman semi-defendant, Daniele De Rossi, on the eve of the League of Champions match with Barcelona, noted the importance of compaction and backup in the game with such a strong rival.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21.45 Moscow time.
Let's remind you, "SE" will do her texting.
"Barcelona" is a special rival, a good team with excellent players, quotes the official UEFA website, De Rossi.
It's hard to play with blue-grenades, because they have not only a unique style, but also a bright identity.
To keep them, we're gonna have to spend the whole time in the game and back up each other.
Messi is almost always a success when it comes to the contours, so we need to keep the volume and the organization.
Jezov is hoping to be part of the start-up SKA in a match with "Slovan."
The UKA Golkiper, Ilya Jezov, stressed that he was hoping to join the army's start-up team in the next HLC match.
He went out on the ice instead of Mikko Coskinen at the 23rd in the 0:3 account, and repelled all the shots at his gate, and the fourth goal was missed by the SCA after replacing the goalie with a sixth field player.
The next match will be on the way out against Slavanov.
I hope I'm gonna go out in the next start-up game, and I say "R-Sport" to Jezov.
I'm not a goalie expert, I'm a goalie, we don't have any repetitives of missing heads, so it's hard to track.
"Dinamo" was a good game, everybody's got a bad game.
The team still loses.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.
Shafarjova got to the hospital with a viral infection.
Lucy Shafarjova is hospitalized with a bacterial infection, reports AFP.
So far, a Czech tennis player is in a clinic in Brno.
The time frame for the reintroduction of the finalist Roland Garros 2015 is not yet known.
Also, on Monday, Shafarjova went up one line in the WTA rating and is now the fifth racket of the world.
Steve Hogg used the girl's phone to get pedophiles to send pictures.
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of child abuse.
Steve Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, logged in to the Internet message service, where he got a number of obscene images of the kids sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found her phone missing, and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She checked it out and found the shocking pictures, and immediately drew her mother's attention to it.
The police came in and saw five images, after which I looked at the computers found at this address, and found the "matched" query in the search system, using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done it, because it could have "attracted paedophiles," and then he would have "pretend he was a cop to frighten them."
The Chief Justice, Aileed Robertson, told the Sheriff's Court in Dundee: "He said it was a addiction, he was a prey to frighten people.
He admitted to making requests on the computer, but he said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to frighten paedophiles.
He was interrogated about a conversation with an unknown person who sent him images, and about asking for more photos.
He said he was doing it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she called her mother, she was trembling and crying.
She saw obscene images on her phone, and then a face-to-face bet was made on the defendant.
The girl was interrogated and reported that the accused used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road to Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of making indecent photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating the terms of bail on 25 January this year and not appearing at the court hearing on 24 March this year.
The defendant's counsel, Gregor Sim, made an application not to include Hogg on the list of sex offenders, as it can be shown that the crime was not a “essential sexual element”.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael suspended the sentence until October, until the social services' statements.
Hogg was released on bail in the case, but he was placed in pre-trial detention for the other remaining cases.
It was added to the list of persons who had committed sexual offences even before the date of the sentence.
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe has been reading the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest national leader, fell down a staircase earlier this year from the runway.
He didn't get hurt, but the video with the fall scene was instantly available on social media.
The opening of the Parliament was also marred by the statements of the parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats to warn them against whistling out Mugabe at the time of the address.
A month ago, they mastered the President during his address to the nation in Parliament, a speech that Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
A member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, Innocent Goneze, stated that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
"The report came from a number that is not displayed, but it is entitled `Death'," he told the journalists at the end of Mugabe's speech.
Noted members of the Parliament, it warned that the immunity would end in the House of Parliament, and as soon as it came out, parliamentary immunity would not work.
A member of Parliament stated that a party led by Morgan Tswangirai was “concerned” with threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will shorten to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is planning to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs under its programme of restructuring and reducing the cost of services.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two listed companies, decoupling the production of computers and printers from the fast-growing hardware and service sectors.
The estimated reduction in jobs will cost about $2.7 billion, starting from the fourth quarter, in Hewlett-Packard.
"This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise company," said Meg Whitman, Chairman and Director-General of Hewlett Packard, who will head the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than Hewlett-Packard is now, and the business portfolio will be wider and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients all over the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of over US$ 50 billion and will “focus on the provision of previously unattainable complex technology solutions” to companies, as reported in the company's application.
This is how a company, founded in the 1930s by the University of Stanford graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard for the production of electrical equipment, was called the “place of birth of the Silicon Valley” in Palo Alto.
Hewlett Packard is in the process of major restructuring to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This is a step by HP, the world's second personal computer manufacturer, and one of the US's major tech companies, the latest in this sector, based on the belief that highly-specialized companies are working better.
The captain of the Arsenal, Michael Arteta, says that his co-clubs should support the traumatized Jack Wilshire before the game with Dinamo Zagreb.
In a conversation with Wilshire, Wenger also stressed that it was still September, and that if Wilshire's recovery was to go as planned, there would be nothing to stop him from getting back to the game for Christmas.
With the most positive development, Wilshire will miss at least the next four games in England, and in view of what has happened, his participation in the European Cup next summer remains in question.
Most of all, in this recent problem, Wilshire finished the previous season with the only injury to his ankle and was about to return to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury is not a threat to his career."
It's just not a complete healed bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It's not about the ankles or the injuries he's had before.
These may be medically related things, but as Wenger also admitted, there is a risk of further injury to any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unwelcome trend.
According to the Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has 23 different injuries in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he played only 65 of the 157 Arsenal games in the league in the last five seasons.
If you look at the Arsenal scale, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007 to 2008, the Arsenal was one of the two prime league clubs, on which the highest number of days was lost due to the injuries.
Hungarian admits the possibility of getting stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal trusts that the improvement of injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you're back in line after an injury, you've been vulnerable for a while - in this time you need to regain your strength and gain a competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to do it.
I hope he'll recover physically, I'm sure of it, and I'm sure that his career will be what he deserves.
The Arsenal launches a campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday with the Dinamo-Zagrew game and will continue it on Saturday with the Chelsey game and next Wednesday with the Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger is about to rotate.
Ector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey didn't come to Croatia, so they're probably going to play Mathieu Debusi and Arteta.
Wenger may also include Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Gira to replace Nacho Morelia and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a bit of rest to the players who need it," said Wenger.
Although the Arsenal is an absolute Favorite in group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most depressing in Europe.
"Dinamo" has not lost any of the 41 matches since they managed to spend the last season as "The Invincable."
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by an earthquake with a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that the Arsenal learned a lesson from last season, when the team was defeated in the Monaco League of Champions game, and remains with little hope to lead the club to win the Final Cup of Champions.
"This is an incredible drive," said Wenger.
The Arsenal has never done this before.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm a realist with a history.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
"FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us some serious lessons in male friendships
The absence of such stories is striking, especially given how desperate the need for men to be candid, now more than ever, while the suicide rate among young men has been at the highest in 15 years.
In 2013, this was the single largest cause of death among men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more common than women.
In an effort to address the problem of the “campagne against Unhappiness”, she declared 2015 as the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression has shown that if the patient has a good number of friends in a normal mood, the chances of recovery are double.
In the same way, for those who are not depressed, the circle of emotionally sound friends halves the risk of mental illness.
But, of course, for a friendship to work, first of all, it has to be.
In an era when social media are run, when style prefers content, the speed of response is often more appreciated than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, fond of fun, and successful, even if there is real loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, all because of our inner values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a greater impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire recently remarked, the maker of video games, you don't actually buy any more happiness with money.
The merit of the Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each character was not defined by his own work, but rather by a person who was manifest in his dealings with his friends.
Joey's humour and Chandler's constant hug, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' sighing for Rachel -- all of this is based on the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As the employee of the Samaritance said to me, "...my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal is to stress how even the smallest of friends can be of benefit."
Often, the men who come to us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old teaching of "live with it" is strong, as is the feeling that frank talking about problems can be perceived as a weakness."
Fryends is one of the things that comes to mind when I'm trying to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the slightest moments of male friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the status of an outsider on the phone helps people in times of desperation, while long-term support comes from the next circle of family and friends.
So, if you're going to see FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where you've completely rebuilt the decorations for the holiday, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for a drink.
Or even better, if you see a single man in Starbucks, smile and say hi.
You don't have to guess what a friendship can do.

Dee Maria scores a goal, helping SWU to defeat Malmö.
Angel di Maria, along with Blaise Mathudy and Edinson Cavanaugh, celebrates the ball-cuffed gates of Malmö.
Angel di Maria, debuting in the League of Champions, scored a goal, which allowed SWU to easily pass the Malmö on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the response to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavanaugh did their job when "Paris St. Germain" began his game at the League of Champions with a very convenient win of 2:0 against "Malmö" at Park de Prince Stadium on Tuesday.
Dee Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the League of Champions as a player "SWG" to point out to the French champs, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavanaugh hit the goal for the 61st minute.
In addition to the Real Madrid and the Donkey Checker in group A, "Pary" needed to make a good start in the game against the Swedish champs, as they were not aiming to play-off, but to follow up on a series of successful games for the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned the glasses, but at the same time, it was not the best decision of Laurent Blanc to find Zlatan Ibrahimovich useless in the attack, and later to replace him on the field in a game against a team from his hometown and club, where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win a home or a guest in the League of Champions, so win a 2-0 win, give the opponents a problem, and play a good role in the defense -- it's a good start, even if there are more things we need to do in the season," said Blanc.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, even though I wish we'd hit one or two more balls.
He returned after an injury in one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her a 2-2 tie in a match with the Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was taken to the back of Di Maria for a fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker was identified as a player who was able to take SVU to a new level in Europe after being bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he ran out of Marco Verratti behind the Malmö defense, he had a beautifully completed the attack by sending a ball past Johann Willand to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone then expected SVU to win easy and big, they had to be disillusioned.
The "Malmö", who defeated Celtic in the playoffs to get to this stage, with nine world-level players in the field at the start of the game, five protectors and two strongbacks in the middle of the field, was a major adversary.
But, with the exception of the hit by Nicola Jurdzic, where the ball swung past Kevin Trapp's long-distance tower for the 34th minute, they attacked very little.
At the same time, SVU has at times failed with inconclusive transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovich, who, in the first half alone, has not been able to do at least five attempts, and then has not been able to process the ball that was slaughtered by Cavanaugh as soon as the game resumes.
Still, he proved to be much more skillful in the exact Passover, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovich, who, Di Maria, sent the ball with a twisted punch, which went in his brace by Viland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour's mark thanks to Cavanaugh, and the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball in the season after putting the ball in the center of the field with Maxwell's left flank.
This put an end to all the ideas that Malmö had about getting back in the game, and only by seizing the ball by Viland from a close range did it not allow David Louis to increase the final score before the replacement Esekel Lovessie didn't count the goal at the end of the match.
Coach "Malme" Aghe Hareide later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions was last December."
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is the wrong level.
Qualifications are not sufficient.
Hail "Pary"!
It was a wonderful match with them.
Glencore earns $2.5 billion on the stock market
The Swiss mining and trade giant Glencore, who has been affected by the fall in commodity prices, has earned $2.5 billion to sell shares as part of his grand debt-reducing plan.
Glencore, a London Stock Exchange company, made a statement that it had sold a new stock of about £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
The company, which has lost 57 per cent of its market value, is trying to cope with the collapse of commodity prices, while China’s recession is making demand worse and creating chaos in world markets.
With the release of new shares at a soft-price price, Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange took up their early morning bids on Wednesday.
The stock rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which at the opening was 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore started a $2.5 billion stock sale last week as part of a massive plan to cut its 30-billion-dollar debt by about a third.
The company sold 125 cents apiece of new stock, a discount of 2.4 per cent at the end of the bid on Tuesday.
It hosted 1.3 billion new shares, representing 9.99 per cent of the company's statutory capital.
As a result of fear of a continued recession in the Chinese economy, the value of iron ore fell by about half, while coal, copper, and other raw materials fell by 20 to 40 per cent.
The White House confirms Cy Jinping's visit to Washington.
The White House confirmed on Tuesday in an official report that China's head of China, Xi Jinping, would be making an official visit to the United States later this month.
This visit, Cy Qingpin's first visit to Washington, D.C., will take place on September 25, and will be a follow-up visit to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The President and First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, will also receive Cy Jinping and Pan Liuan's wife at a government luncheon on the evening of the same day after the two leaders have held bilateral talks.
“The visit of President Xi Jinping will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the US and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, and will enable the US and China Presidents to address the issues in dispute in a constructive manner,” the report states.
It is expected that Xi Jinping, who was first announced in February, will stay in Seattle to meet with the leaders of a number of leading United States technology companies on his way to Washington, D.C., and then go to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi Jingping are expected to discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington’s concern about the alleged Chinese cyberspionage and China’s growing categoricality on the issue of the disputed South China Sea.

They turned out to be a 26-year-old in Moscow.
More than 40 orders and orders have been signed by Vladimir Yakušev.
More than 40 decrees and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tumen Region, Vladimir Yakušev, at a meeting of the Regional Government Presidium.
Some of them related to the allocation of funds to educational and health-care institutions in the municipalities.
In particular, funds have been made available for the purchase of a bus for a school in the Nizhenetavodina region, and for the major maintenance of the regional hospital in the Kazan region.
As indicated in the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the major maintenance of the second floor of the therapeutic unit.
Refurbishment of the hot and cold water, water, power and electrical, air and air systems will be carried out, the facade of the building will be refurbished, the premises will be refurbished, and a range of fire and energy conservation activities will be carried out.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
The second Forum of the Regions of Russia and Belarus, to be held in Sochi from 17 to 18 September, will be attended by a Tunean delegation led by the Governor.
The upcoming event in Sochi and the interim outcome of the cooperation are described by the Honorary Consul-General of the Republic of Belarus in Tumenia, Wladimir Sugla, who joined the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovic, what are the objectives of the Sochi Forum?
The grand event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on the fruitful cooperation of the regions, the important links between the two States.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, are scheduled to attend the plenary.
The plenary and sectional meetings will focus on the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, the legal framework and the programmes of the Union State.
The Governor of the Tumen Region will address the forum.
I think this is an indication of the successful, sustained inter-regional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
The Forum will also be attended by representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian businessmen.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions will be held, including from the Tumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new, win-win contracts and agreements.
I will add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk last June.
It was attended by more than 200 delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important agreement on cooperation between the Tumen and the Minsk Region was signed.
The fact that a permanent seminar was held in Tumeni at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus also points to the value of our work.
In addition, the delegation of the APC of the Tumen region has visited Belarus to study the experience of the Belarusians in the training of agricultural personnel, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the agro-industry complex.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city.
What topics have been discussed?
In a meeting with the Governor of the Tumen oblast, Vladimir Yakusev, he spoke of the region ' s cooperation with the Republic of Belarus in today ' s difficult circumstances.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be addressed - they are needed to lower the cost of the machines to the end-user.
Problems in the work of the “Belshina” Tumen trade house and options for prevention of losses were discussed.
The issues are important, as investment projects need to work well and make a profit to the region.
Reference was made to the continued supply of UAO passenger and cargo equipment “MAZ”, the development of the UAO service centre “MAZ”, which was set up in Tumeni on the basis of the UAO “TPTP”.
The discussion also referred to the preparation of a visit by the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus before the end of the year.
Another theme of the interview was the finalization and signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the Tumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of the relationship promise to come to a new level.
The questions also concerned the oblast centre.
In a meeting with the head of the city of Tumene, Alexander Moor, we talked about renovating the Tumen bus park.
Around 100 buses are already "breathing in the moor," so a new shipment of cars from Belarus is needed to work on gas, clean fuels.
Another aspect: The Tumen Lift Plant is working with one of the leading manufacturers of the UAO's “Mogileviftmash” elevators to receive the components.
In my view, this work could have been more active, given the new elevators in the regional center.
I will add that, within the framework of the consul ' s extended powers, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan Region, Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of the expansion of trade and the supply of modern Belarusian technology in Zauralya was discussed.
A meeting with the Omi Governor is scheduled for the end of September.
There are five constituents of the Russian Federation in the extended consular district, but the Tumen can be described as the district headquarters.
The region is a range of promising projects, including the work of the Honorary Consul.
Generally, such meetings are both relevant and good in order to address the many problems directly and quickly, reducing their severity and promoting mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current context, it is vital not to break the gap by continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon won't focus on the ethnic diversity of people involved in film production.
Matt Damon argued with the African-American producer Effie Brown, claiming behind the scenes that there was no need to take account of the ethnic composition.
On Sunday's release of the "Project Greenlight" on HBO, a prominent actor interrupted Brown when she tried to stress the need for an alternative view of the main black character in the script selected for the project.
"Multiversity is appropriate when you cast for the movie itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
Curious Brown, not trusting her ears, exclaimed "Wow, wow, come on, come on" all the time, while an actor from "Marciane" gave comments live on the air.
In order to discuss the finalists of the show, Damon and Brown joined the producers Ben Affleck and the Farelli brothers.
"I'd like the participants - no matter who the director is - to think about the way Harmony's image they're going to follow," said Brown at the start of the discussion.
The only black character is a whore who's beaten by a white pimp.
The film's producer, Die White People, was for Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio to be the director of the film; Damon was very opposed to saying, "we can get the wrong thing in the end."
After this discussion was aired on TV, social media erupted with disapproving comments to Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni was angry about the video: "Explanation of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in the room is the white one who hurts."
Tweet has more than 5000 retweets and 4000 licks.
Damon's remarks are coming up just when the most pressing issue on the agenda of the public debate is the literate media coverage of race.
After a boy named Michael Brown was shot by a policeman in 2014, Black Lives Matter became popular throughout the country, calling on lawmakers and the authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colored population.
In February, Prince referred to this movement at the time of the nomination of the "Album of the Year" at the Grammy Awards.
"Alboms still matter," he said.
Like the books and the lives of blacks, the albums still matter.
Most recently, Black Lives Matter leaders issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News staff member, Elizabeth Hasselbek, on whether the group would be viewed as a group of haters.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders of the movement reported.
It was recently announced that Damon was on the list of show business leaders, producers and media magnets invited to visit the Pope of Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
We don't know if the actor accepted the invitation or met the pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards the first champion
The professional rocker and waiter Isaac Caldiero was the first to win "American Ninja Warrior" on Monday night, taking home the $1 million prize.
At this sporting show, the seventh season of which has just been over, none of the participants have ever been able to complete all the stages of the barrier track.
In the finals of the season, two participants, Caldier and the cameraman, Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task involved a 75-foot-long rope in 30 seconds.
Brittany was the first to do the job, and he was the first athlete in the history of "American Ninja Warrior", which was a debilitating phase 4, but Caldierro was able to do the job three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
After the victory with the greatest effort, Caldiero, who was shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview with "E!News".
"To think of it incredibly, I've never made or lived for more than $10,000 a year," remarked Isaac to E! such a major upturn in his earnings.
And all of a sudden... I never imagined how it was... the future was unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed met with the "The Hollywood Reporter" to talk about the finals and why Brittany, who was the first to pass the track, would not get any money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest bidder.
"If the finished player is more than one, the prize gets the fastest of them," said Weed.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes life, it still enjoys a lot of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels offended about it.
He's happy with what he's done.
He's got a ton of fan resentment.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero to his kids and his wife.
Jeff told me, "if I was to lose, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would've felt the same way if we'd switched roles.
"America Ninja Warrior" will be back with the eighth season, which will be released in the spring of 2016.
"Detroth Tigers" quietly go around the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS – The second half of the season was not particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers are now in the last position in the American League Central Division.
Pretending to be an obstacle, the taigers won the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with a sum of 5-4 on the Targetfield.
The Twins missed the chance to cut half-game behind Houston Astros and to take second place in playoffs after the winners.
For the Detroiters, even for one night, it was a return of the word to the letter F, which eluded most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they do," said the manager of the Tigers, Brad Osmus.
Pitcher "Tigers" Alfredo Simon made his contribution in support of the attacks, which led Detroit to score three points in the first two innings, and then added one in the sixth and the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was just his third quality start in nine exits.
"I just want to end the year with good indicators," said Simon.
Pitchers don't get to drop in every game, so I want to go deeper in the game.
Victor Martinez, the designated Taggers, was able to take off three hits, and was hit by two wounds, the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three hits since four hits in the game against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well with a bat," said Osmus.
He was very good at (the quality of the batter), much better at the bat, and he kept that quality for the game.
After three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance to get back in the game.
The central receiver, Byron Buxton, opened an inning doll on the left-hand side of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, making the bow, took the first base, and the second baseman, Brian Dozier, got a strike out at Simon's swing, before his place was left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overcame Moira, the only player on the way, before the new appointment of Miguel Sano, who hit a two-way single to the left of right-hand Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of ants off the out and a parallel wound on Verhagen's second base, he was able to get the third baseman, Trevor Pluff, to hit the dobble.
It was the 27th time for a top league player this season, when Plouff hit the ball on a double-player.
After Detroit added the insurable wounds in the first half of the ninth inning, Moyer made RBI a "dable" in the space between the outfillers against Bruce Rondon's "Taygers" closing pitcher, and the bill was 5-4.
But the right-hand player hit Sano after three strikes and got his fifth fair.
Detroit took advantage of the temporary non-practice Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers made three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher who was on the list of injured until the game itself, missing for more than a month due to the inflammation of his lumbar.
"Surely not the start I'd like," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I began to feel more comfortable and so I was able to make some pretty good shots in the third inning."
After the first batter hit the first base, Hughes left the single to Ian Kinsler.
Wok at two outs of Ritfielder J.D. Martinez led Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first shot in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his "0 for 21" series with an E.R. in an effective position.
The third base player, Nick Castellanos, followed by a single with another wound, but Victor Martinez was shot out in an attempt to get closer to the third base, and the threat was eliminated.
The Tigers increased the bill in the second inning, getting a single-out "dable" from the catcher James McCann and a double-out single from the central batterer Anthony Gows, and it was 3-0.
"It was a strong hit," said the manager "Twins" Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got right at the right point.
Hughes, whose throws were considered to have been cast in an unattainable third inning, was then replaced by a right-hand relier, A. J. Ahter.
Hughes was numbered three times six hits and a four-strike-out wook.
Note: Pitcher, right-hand "Taigers", Anibal Sánchez was out of the player due to the right arm tension.
He's gonna be screened by Dr. James Andrews, who was doing Sánchez's shoulder surgery in 2007.
For Sanchez, who has been on the trauma list since mid-August, it is scheduled to start on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, the left-handed pitcher, Daniel Norris, will leave the list of the injured and turn up against the Twins.
Norris, who left the Taggers at four start-ups since it was acquired in exchange for David Pryce's left-hand pitcher on July 30, has one win and one down.
He has not been in the game since August 20, due to the spraining of his scythe.
"Tagers" and "Twins" will complete a series of three games on "Targuetfield" on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play the pitcher, Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original Cadyrov's complaint for the book "Molba to God" was filed with the South Pacific Court.
The South Pacific City Court received an original appeal from the representative of the President of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, against the decision to recognize the “extremist material” of the book Molba to God: Its meaning and place in Islam, by Interfax, with reference to the Chairman of the Gorge of Alexander Chuhrai.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the participants in the trial.
Chuhra refused to comment on the statements made by some members of the State Duma of the Russian Federation to test the compass for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence agencies and ISIL.
"Let them comment on such stupidity themselves," he said.
On 11 September, the South Sahara City Public Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognize the book as “extremist material”.
An appeal from the South Sakhalinsk Public Prosecutor's Office arrived on Friday night.
There are nuances: in the Public Prosecutor's Office, they believe that they have asked the court to declare extremist only the author's opinion, not the Koran.
In the opinion of the Public Prosecutor, the judge made the wrong decision, "Chuhray reported.
The decision to recognize the book as “extremist material” was taken on August 12, 2015.
In particular, “extremist” quotes from the Koran,“We worship you, and we call upon You for help,” and “Do not call on anyone along with God.
The cadets called the decision-makers on the book "The Cheetahs and Provocators."
He called on the deputies of the State to prohibit by law court decisions relating to the texts of the Holy Books.
“I firmly believe that the State Duma must pass a law which prohibits the taking of judicial decisions relating directly to the texts of the Koran and other Divine Words,” Cadyrov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will delete comments that offend migrants and refugees
Facebook staff intend to delete posts and comments that have a negative impact on migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect complaints from users about illegal content.
It is the aim of Facebook to combat manifestations of xenophobia and racism online, together with the German Ministry of Justice.
For example, the previous day, the head of the Haiko Maas Department stated that the Ministry of Justice was currently working with social media professionals to set up a special group of moderators.
It was the duty of the participants to follow up and delete the comments that were not relevant to migrants and refugees.
According to Hayko Maasa, it is assumed that the authors of the non-cooperative post will receive notice of the reason for the deletion of their entry.
Organizations whose professionals are involved in the collection of complaints from social media users about abusive posts should also facilitate the rapid blocking of illegal content.
Facebook intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts that had been negative to migrants and refugees, the management of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice had been taken after the German segment of Facebook had been marked by an upsurge in xenophobic sentiments.
One of the most obvious reasons for this was the unprecedented migratory crisis in the EU some time ago.
For example, Germany is already overcrowded with all the shelters.
On the day before, the country ' s authorities decided to temporaryize migrants in the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
The internally displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are incarcerated in barracks in which prisoners and prisoners of war have been held under the Nazi regime.
In Moscow cemeteries, there will be areas for relaxation.
In the near future, a number of capital cemeteries are equipped with special areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
The first will be the Booth, Domodedi and Shcherbin Cemetery.
The first zone for a mental rest has already appeared at the Troekur Cemetery in Moscow.
Such plots will follow in other parts of the city.
Artem Ekimov, the head of the State Budget Institution, Ritual, spoke about this portal.
The relaxation zones will be small green areas like parks.
In the view of the experts, in such corners, visitors to the cemeteries will be able to rest, to be alone and to regain their psychological strength.
In the near future, the relaxation zones will be built in Domodedovo, Butov and Shcherbin cemeteries, and then in other parts of the capital.
According to the head of the GBU “Ritual”, if the cemetery is to be expanded, the builders will try to keep the existing forest as much as possible.
Green plantations will serve as a living fence, which will separate the rest areas and the area to be placed directly in the graveyards.
The experts of the GBU, Ritual, also indicated their intention to propose the removal of the hedges at the graveyards.
The new cemeteries can indeed become barren.
In addition, in the Ritual GBU, the willingness to install electronic terminals to enable visitors to learn GPS coordinates and grave number plates.
In June of this year, the Ritual of GBU also proposed that the cost of burial services be adjusted according to the time of the year.
So, digging a grave in summer time will cost a thousand roubles less, weeks in winter, when the land is frozen.
Note that in the last year, the cost of all rites has on average increased by 10 per cent.
Five days later, a lost fungi was found in the forest.
The old man was alive, though he spent more than a hundred hours in the woods without food.
It was possible to find a greasy mountain ranger thanks to the combined efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Pannikov, correspondent: "A 79-year-old pensioner from the Tamba oblast spent five days in the woods."
No food or water.
He was wanted by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There's even a moviewriter with a dog, but there's no result.
The man was found after the helicopter was involved in the search.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the woods to pick up the mists and the submersibles, but he didn't come back by the evening.
The family immediately called for help, and the next day, rescuers and people from a nearby village, just about 30 people, had been brought up to find a fungi.
A fire and rescue centre helicopter joined them for the fifth day.
Andrey Seletkov, the head of the search and rescue team of the Smolen State Fire and Rescue Center, said, "The helikopter has been enlisted, the man has been found."
Gone very far, completely elsewhere.
That was about 12 km from the search site.
He went a long way at his age.
It was a miracle to live.
Grybnik was taken to the Central District Hospital in Berlin, unconscious, in a very difficult state.
He was diagnosed with pneumonia as well as severe dehydration and refrigeration.
As an old man was able to survive after five days in the woods, the doctors have no idea.
Valentina Nepša, head of Therapeutic Department of the Valentine CBR: "Personal examination, treatment."
Infuse therapy, anti-bacterial.
Taking into account all his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, and it's still hard, but it's positive.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovitch every year arrives at Smilencia from the Tamba oblast.
His grandson says his grandpa used to go out to pick mushrooms, but far into the woods never went further.
Alexei Spitchenko, grandson of the found fungi, said, "Foreze is not far from the road, not from here."
I've been visiting my family for a few years.
So I went to get the fungi.
I guess I went a bit far and I got lost.
With the beginning of the fungi season, people are regularly lost in all parts of the Smolen oblast.
In the last few days alone, there have been five similar cases.
Squads remind us that we need to go to the woods in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches, and compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave traces behind so that we can go back.
Emergency An-2 sat on the sidelines of a brother's taiga.
Right in the middle of a sec in Siberia, an An-2 emergency.
An emergency landing was made by Enicey, a Redyar Airlines company, 68 km from Bratsk.
No casualties or casualties, but the plane itself suffered significant damage when it landed.
An-2 was on a service flight.
It had three crew members on board, a commanding officer, a co-pilot, and an on-board engineer, reporting to Interfax.
The aircraft was on the route of Czernogorsk-Ilimsk to Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the plane has already arrived in Bratsk.
The Brother Transport Office, after an An-2 emergency landing, has begun to verify compliance with the air safety legislation.
An investigation team from the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor ' s Office left for the scene.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed their plane with passengers due to a technical failure at an abandoned secret airstrip in Komi.
Motors and on-board electronics have failed on the ship, but the crew has done the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured in an emergency landing.
News of the Economy – Nobel laureate: Globalisation
The process of globalization should have contributed to the reduction of inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, and the income gap in the developing economies is on the contrary increasing.
Eric Muskin.
In order to correct this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, the Chief Researcher of the International Laboratories for Analysing and Choices of the INE, the 2007 Nobel Laureate for Economics, Eric Muskin, is of the view.
In the last 20 years, the world has experienced an unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become more and more open.
Proponents of globalization have predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true in many respects," stresses Muskin.
For example, China and India have experienced a major per capita growth in GDP.
But it's not all that cheerful.
It was expected that globalization would narrow the gap between the “poor” and the “poor” in the poor countries, which was manifest in the large inequality of income, and, more specifically, in pay.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Muskin in his article “Why global markets have not reduced inequality in emerging economies”, published in The World Bank Economic Review, which has been translated and quoted by NEE.
Together with economist Professor Michael Kremer of Harvard University, Erik Muskin has developed an alternative theory that shows why the income gap in poor countries is growing as globalization grows, like the NEE of the EME.
In the new global market, specific processes are taking place.
To show them, Maskin has four levels of skills - A and B for rich countries, C and D for the poor.
After globalization, D professionals from poor countries do not have the skills to work with A and B professionals from rich countries.
And if people at level C from poor countries are getting a lot of pay from working with B from the rich, then they don't feel a lot of growth, or they don't get a lot of pay.
The resulting effect is that the internationalization of production will widen the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thus increase the level of inequality.
Cremer and E. Maskinim have an incredibly beautiful model, alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It makes it possible to explain why globalization has led to income inequality, ” says Fouad Alesserov, a regular professor in charge of the International Laboratorium for Analyses and Choices, and the head of the Department of Mathematics of the UCE.
And as any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a splash of empirical work in this field.
The solution, according to Eric Muskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, workers themselves, according to a scientist, do not have the means to do so, and companies are not in a position to pay for their training.
In such a situation, Governments, international agencies, NCBs and private foundations can play a significant role, according to Maskin.
The scientist notes that the theory that has been developed does not in any way call for a halt to the process of globalization, which has been and is bearing fruit in the form of a country ' s GDP growth.
Durbent: A living connection of time.
Derbent, one of Russia's oldest cities, is celebrating his 2000th birthday in September.
In the holiday program, the Daguestan National Cultures Festival and the old-time fair, the Derbent Tea and Open Temple Day, the "2000 Two-hours Music Show" and the guided to the renovated Petra I Museum.
The medieval rocks of the fortress of Naryn-Kala, the old Arab inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens, all of which have come from the pages of "The Thousands and One Night."
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has been in place since ancient times.
Although the Roman Empire, Byzantine, Hazar Caganate, and the Golden Horde claimed it.
The age of the East platen, which grows in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mechets, is a few centuries old.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russia Wildland Monuments Programme.
The shadow of scattering krones saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
The person who attends the mosque will be given a flavoring cup of tea and will be served with adornment from the Dagestan, such as honeyfigs, hurmahs, musmules, petals, ayrans and candy.
In Derbenth, for centuries, they have used big samavages to give a lot of people a cup of tea at one time.
The inscription on the entrance to Juma's sword says the building was built in 115H.
That is, in 733, according to the Gregorian calendar.
This is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is astonishing as it is the magnitude and solemnity of the arcades of the domes and cones, which are based on the square columns and lighted by the light of the sun from the tiny windows.
The content and breeding of pigeons is a traditional obsession of the people of Derbent.
The owners of the petbirds put pigeons in the yards, under the trees, in attics.
An exciting sight is the upsurge in the sky of a pack of white doves, like the outbreak of a holiday firework.
For the defence of an adversary, the ancient Persians closed the Cape Gate with a double stone wall.
As it went 500 meters in the sea, it shut down Derbent Harbor.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included on the UNESCO World Heritage List as the most well-preserved monument of the ancient fortification family.
The carpets in Derbent have been weaving since the fifth century, and the technology of this unique trade has remained almost unchanged to date.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for any taste, i.e., wool, cotton, or bark of all colors and colors, with or without wool, with a complex design and a bizarre hive.
The building of the city began with the malls, blocks with one-story stone buildings.
Over the years, the maestros have not changed much.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioners on the walls, and streetlights remind us that you are not in the Middle Ages, but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city, there are still details of a plumbing built by the Persians about a thousand years ago.
Today, there are ancient water sources in which the locals are still collecting water.
Many derbents prefer water from cranes to water from historical water.
In Derbent was one of the center of pottery.
The water and the charts, the dishes, the jars, the cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
The pottery’s hands are still producing excellent ceramic products for both practical and souvenir purposes.
On holiday days and festivals, the crowds are gathered under a strained wire at which students from the Republican School of Cirque Art are present.

There's a Museum of Culture and Life of the Old Derbent in the ex-Girl Bathroom today.
Used to wash the virgins and the bridesmaids with their girlfriends, and now anyone who wants to see the mall, the hot and cold pools that have gone to the past bathing appetizers.
Most Derbent homes have hot water, but baths and steam are as popular as they used to be.
The benefits of warming the body with a ferry are written in ancient books.
After the bathing, the blood is improved, the muscles are tired, the body is flexible, and easy.
The Commonwealth Festival, which is held on the site of the Naryn Kala fortress, is attended by the ethno-bodies of many parts of the Dagestan.
The participants in the national suits dance, play folk tunes, sing the songs of the people of the Caucasus, and give the visitors a tasty homemade cheese.
Kirchlar is the place where 40 martyrs who have put their head behind Islam are buried.
This is one of the most admirable complexes for North Caucasus Muslims.
The yellow sarcophages have been carved from time to time from solid stone blocks and are, as Arabs say, oriented on the west-east axis.
The brothers Gabriel and Albert Yakubov cut and shave their clients in a small salon near the Upper Market.
The barbershop has been in this place for years.
The receptions of the civil trade are passed on from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Yakubov brothers can do not only the traditional but also the most modern hair.
On one of the streets of the Old City, a house was kept in which a decabrist, Alexander Bestujev-Marlinsky, who was exiled to the Caucasus, lived.
After learning the Turkic language and collecting the ethnographic material, he described Derbent of the first third of the 19th century with his ancient monuments, his life, and his people.
Teahana is a traditional East club, where only tea and homemade bakes are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, talk to their friends, and sort out some kind of work problem.
As in the past, women are not encouraged to cross the threshold of the teahouse.
The Derbent dance band "Cape" was set up three years ago, but it has already been possible to take part in national and Russian-level events.
The ensemble soloists are rehearsing every day, mastering the people's Awar, Dargin, Tatian, Armenian dances.
As the evening breaks down, when the streetlights are lighted up, the locals sit on berries next to homes with terraces.
Typically, Derbents are discussing domestic issues.
But in the run-up to the jubilee, they are increasingly reminiscent of the unique history of their city, which has affected the fate of the entire Black Sea-Cape region.
Domodedodes has a business game at the airport.
The capital has a new form of education.
Four hundred students tried themselves as airport staff.
To do this, the Domodedodes have modeled three airhavens.
Young people not only searched and logged the passengers, but also served the planes.
It's all in the form of a business game, but it's not in the tricky way.
Late flights, at once two passengers with fractures on board, the stairwell was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For a real airport, hell.
For the one who settled in Domodedonov's hangar, it's a standard set of tasks to be done by newcomers.
In one hangar, there are three major airports from all over the world.
There are now four hundred students from capital colleges and colleges.
An unparalleled chance to learn everything about the air-hawk world.
The registration of passengers, the maintenance of fixed-wing aircraft, and the circulation of baggage - even the buses on the airfield, the stairwells and the search of passengers - were entrusted to them.
And the passengers are a lot of trouble.
One has a problem with the documents, the other one has missed the flight, the other one has filled the bag with suspicious items.
And you have to deal with all of this, like in life, in a minimum.
For each of these tasks, they are charged a certain amount of money, virtual money, as if the airline had paid them the corresponding amount for the maintenance of the flight.
"For failure to do so, they are charged with a fine," explains the financial analyst of the game, Dmitry Hilko, in an interview with the "West-Moscow" program.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are following the matter closely.
For them, this test is an attempt to try out a new form of study.
She's already found a place in high school.
“Six cross-regional centres of competence will be set up, which will, in fact, become new models for modern colleges with modern management, with highly qualified staff, with modern equipment,” states Natalia Zolotaryev, Director of the Department of State Policy for the Training of Workers and Complementary Professional Education of the Ministry of the Russian Federation.
But the students don't have global plans.
After three days of training, it seems like they're gonna need a day off.
At the same time, the scores for the examination were quite material.
The newest smarties, the best I've ever seen!
"I've got it for responding in a timely manner to our Instagram airport claim," he said, "satisfied to the player, the PR manager of the "Frankfort Airport" team, Sergey Shuvalov.
The best judges, called pencils, were taken to invite them to work by the time they finished their studies.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia deplored the closure of the library ' s foreign literature at the American Centre.
The centre has been in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the Russian government's unilateral decision to shut down the American Embassy Center at the M.I. Rudomino State Library in Moscow.
“The single-sided steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent times call into question the commitment of the Russian Government to the links between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been interrupted even during the Cold War and in other difficult moments of the long history of the relations of our countries,” states Ambassador John Tefft of the United States to the Interfax.
The American Center has created deep and strong links between the people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and it served as a venue for meetings with a number of American dignitaries, including cosmonauts, artists, sportsmen, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Only last year, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and received more than 50,000 Russian visitors," the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, the FLEX Educational Exchange Programme.
The Green Tribunal was quick to kill.
Typical situation: four officials stand at the table of Judge Swattanter Kumar, hearing his claims for the work done.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order to make fun of it," Kumar said.
If there's one more brick, we'll order you to take down all the existing structures.
Kumar is the head of the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial authority set up in 2010 to halt the rapid pollution of the environment, which has been accompanied by a massive economic growth in recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has been able to address more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dams.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop the polluted construction.
The stakes are incredibly high: in the 60 years that have passed since the declaration of independence of enhanced industrial development, India has become one of the world ' s most overcrowded and polluted countries.
The problem is particularly acute in the major mega-cities, where infrastructure development has not kept up with rapid urbanization: the cities are smog-rich, the rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and the few remaining habitats are cut off to new neighbourhoods.
Despite the formal support of the State for the green movement, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it is often the main reason for the major investment projects to be cancelled.
For example, in May this year the Minister of the Environment called the court's decisions “extreme” and “implementable”.
Sometimes the court's decisions cannot be executed within the time limit set by the court, is confirmed by Raj Panjwani's environmental lawyer.
However, an impossible deadline has a positive side: at least it makes the responsible move.
"His main aim is to shake this system," adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has on several occasions cancelled the major structures: it accounts for the cessation of the construction of an airport, a power plant and hundreds of smaller facilities.
People are also being tried to keep in mind: for example, during a discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagnan State, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We can shut down your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," he commented on his decision.
Such explanations, however, are far from always comprehensible to the common people, whose life can be changed by the same pen.
For example, in April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, causing public indignation.
Despite a sharp drop in popularity and criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to overturn the decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Government of New Delhi on the in and out of the car, and he also offered to buy 10,000 extra buses, before he found out in the factories if they were able to do the same.
As sources of pollution such as dumps, fuel quality, and even road incidents began to come to the court ' s attention, the people ' s anger began to slow down a bit.
But the most sick subject of the principled judge was the Ganges River Clean-up Programme, which was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a sacred river for the Hindus, the judge often stops holding back his emotions and turns to a scream.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water out of Ganges on the statue of God, and there were feces in it, - the judge is hot. -
You keep contaminating the river because you think Ganges is Ganges, he'll take all of our sins.
This is the river we worship, and look what you do to it every day.
The clean-up of Ganga is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new Government.
The number of fecal bacteria in this river is now more than 120 times the norm.
Every year, between 1.5 million and 3 out of 700 million Indians in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Ganges Salvation Fund money from the sale of his suit, where he met Barack Obama and 455 other items from his private collection.
Ecologists immediately blamed the premiere for populism: the suit was bought for $700,000, while it takes at least eight billion to clean up the river.
Proponents of the Green Tribunal agree that India still has a long way to go before it can claim to be a developed country, but do not believe that the cost of progress should be green.
"In a developing country, talking about the environment is often seen as an unacceptable luxury, "speaks Malik Bhanota, an activist of the Ganga Call.
And the court is trying to find a golden balance between the environment and development."

Xi Jinping calls for making the economy more open to the world
The economy must become more open to the world to boost its growth, as President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday, in an address to a group that faces the task of leading reform.
“China must focus on attracting foreign investors and experts, and develop a policy of openness,” he said to the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group Committee on the Comprehensive Deepening of Reforms.
He said that greater openness and deeper reform would give the economy new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group has adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of market access regulations for investors, the reform of border controls, the promotion of State-owned enterprises (SOE) that attract private capital, and the revision of the registration system.
According to the statement, a list of economic and production sectors that are inaccessible to investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually re-engineered through test programs.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a more meaningful role in the allocation of resources, the rule of law in the business sector and greater openness, as the statement states.
The Government will also weaken control over the powers given to them by guaranteeing that the companies will run their own business.
The statement also states that China will allow border regions to learn new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to increase local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors in order to open up public-controlled sectors of the economy.
“The Government will not change its policy with respect to foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign financing as well as provide them with better conditions,” states the application.
The procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or a “green card”, will be further facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process.
The meeting also discussed the promotion of the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to an official report issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Lee Keqiang and ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended.
