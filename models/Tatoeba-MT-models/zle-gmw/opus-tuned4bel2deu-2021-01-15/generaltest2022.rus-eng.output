From my point of view, the programme of literature was shaped by women of Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From the 19th-century Russian literature, we preferred Danilevsky and Wolkonski.
They've been writing the bleacher, of course, from the point of view of those Balzacian ladies.
And Psychology and the agony of Tolstoy and Turgenev's characters are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very, very much.

Promtex Microsoft Prestige 105x195.
The Microsoft Prestige model: Comfortability and nature.
The mattress has different rigidities: the medium-strong surface is made up of latex coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft, a natural latex plate.
A spring block from 1,000 springs to a square metre is fast adapted to the body of a sleeping one, warning that the effect of a "wave" or a "gamac" will emerge.
One of the merits of the model is to identify the breathing material.
The latex, perforated for air-tightness, is well ventilated naturally, as is the coconut coke.
As a result, a healthy microclimate of sleeping space is maintained.
The mattress is also subject to an extended guarantee period.
The official guarantee from the manufacturer is five years, in fact the life of the mattress is longer.
A removable jaccard cover, delivered in a kit, is responsible for the protection against dust and pollution.
Buy an orthopedic pillow as a pair to the mattress; it's recommended to keep the spine in the best position during your sleep.
The filler defines the function of the sides - the coconut is an anatomical back support, the latex relaxes the muscles.
Turn on the brain and chase such kinsmen!

What about the guests?
They're fine, and they're gonna have to have a cake with them.
Since then, I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I'm going to make a small table.
And I make them flavor, and I bake them all the time for nothing.
Germany: The fourth inoculation against the coronavirus is inevitable
The fourth inoculation will take place in the summer or fall of 2022.
In the expert ' s view, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with new force.
Despite an intensive vaccination campaign in Germany, no two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be sufficient to provide full protection.
This is the belief of the head of the Ulrich Weigeldt Association of General Practitioners.
This is reported by Die Welt on Saturday, 11 December.
"We expect a fourth vaccination to take place in the summer, at the latest in the fall," the expert says.
In addition, Weigoldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccine can be carried out “in combination with flu vaccines.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccinations can help to combat the spread of the new strain of the Omikron coronavirus.
The new version, however, is particularly dangerous.
For example, Omicronom is three times more likely to be re-infected than Delta or Beta.
This is evident from a preliminary study carried out in South Africa.
On this basis, BioNetech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide an Omikron-adapted vaccine by March 2022.
The companies stress that the two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against the new version of the Omicron coronavirus.
A study by BioNetech and Pfizer found that at two doses of the vaccine, the efficiency is much lower: "the neutralizing potential is more than 25 times lower."
"This indicates that two dosages of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against omicron-stamp contamination," highlighted by BioNTech and Pfizer.
So a third dosage is needed.
The experts are insisting on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, the president of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favour of shortening the time between the second and third inoculations.
In fact, according to the Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel is very strong on this," the expert stressed.
Wobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from a lot of other vibs by what was originally created with the use for under-cold fishing, not just for insulation.
These whiskeys have more than the size of analogues, a share that certainly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting bait.
Another common feature is the top fins of solid and robust plastic, which generate additional vibrations with vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter-ass" catch, Bet-A-Vib is a pretty aggressive game.
Often, the most catchy thing is a simple monotone animation, that is, moving up and down by the oar almost without a pause.
In planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient for catching in a restricted space, swollen with underwater vegetation, root, and other hurdles for which a link is possible.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant in catching a sledge and a big boar, especially in the middle of the winter, when a point-and-aggressive bait is needed.
After reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib immediately unfolds and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib has also been used for the winter catch of pond trout.
To satisfy her whims, two modifications can be made: with or without a sound capsule (NS – NanoSound).
The Bet-A-Vib game has also been shown to irritate a passive peacock that does not even react to a live man.
Bet-A-Vib shows range and accuracy when fished.
This vobulary is comprehensible and unchallenged, well combined with the laces and braided cords of even big diameters.
In order to catch a beetle, a stew, a stew, or a buckle, except evenly, it's relevant, and it's "stroke," sometimes with a "sniffing" down the floor.
If you catch in indelible places, you can change the front triangulation to the doppelganger, which reduces the probability of a lead.
Bet-A-Vib's bait is one of the most persistent and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
With the same success, it can be used in relatively small and relatively deep areas.

In Libya, 7,000 Russian mercenaries have been declared
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries in Libya from the private military company Wagner.
This was announced on Sunday, 12 December, by the President of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled Al-Mishri.
“There are currently more than 7,000 mercenaries in Libya from the Wagner PAC.
They also have planes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Coofra.
They have 30 jets on Gardabia airbases (also used as a civil airport in Sirte) " , quoted by Anadolu.
Khaled Al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries are trying to “capture” the central part of Libya, which extends from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after “bringing their man to power” in the Central African Republic.
Keep Presence
According to the interviewer, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “placed in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufra, as reported in the Agency's publication.
The Russian authorities have officially denied the Kremlin's support for the WAGNER.
Where else might be mercenaries
According to the Agency, Wagner is believed to be active in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training to local forces, personal protection to leaders and the protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Vagnera's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of arms, technology and military services to those countries,” the article states.
According to the media, the “Wagner” allegedly fought in Donbassa, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the CAR.
The group is not listed in the law enforcement agencies or in the register of jurists, and its fighters are not on the uniformed lists of personnel.
The company is under US sanctions.
Recall that earlier 27 EU countries had approved the restritations against Wagner.
The EU Council is expected to adopt this decision on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second House of Parliament with consultative functions with the dominant Islamists in it, writes the TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting on the election of MPs and Head of State from 24 December at least to February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left before the elections, and the chances of their being on time are rapidly falling," states the material.
Against this background, the Supreme Electoral Commission of Libya postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period, and broadcasts Sky News Arabia.
External Politics by the Russians
38% of the Russians see the country's foreign policy as more successful than failure, 29% believe that failure predominates.
"Examples of success - "in Syria, protected, restored peace there," "the North Stream 2 decision," "the whole world has been intimidated by the cool armament," "The Crime we have set aside."
The main setbacks are the “Conflict with Ukraine”, the “Confrontation with Western Countries”, the “Insulation from the World”, a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned the paperwork - all public services have become digital as well.
The Government of Dubai reported a complete phase-out of hard-copy and a move to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided to the public in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirat news agency WAM.
“Today marks the beginning of a new digitalization phase of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a complete, paperless government”, the Crown Prince of the Emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktum, said on Saturday.
Now, in-house and external work in all state institutions in Dubai will be done digitally only through ad hoc information platforms.
The new development has affected all sectors, without exception: health, LAC, the police, municipal authorities, the courts, etc. Many business entities have also joined the Government ' s initiative.
The transition to e-government and the digitalization of documentation began in Dubai in 2018.
In that time, the authorities estimated that 336 million paper sheets had been saved, which was 14 million hours of human work and $353.8 million in cash equivalent.
Formerly, the mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobyan, stated that e-services save the citizens two days a year.

The production and export of Turkish motor vehicles fell below the 2020 level
The production and export of Turkish cars fell sharply in November, as lira depreciated.
As a result, 11 months of industrial performance was worse than last year's result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Turkish Automobile Association.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 cars were manufactured in Turkey, 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
Some 75,000 cars have been sent for export, more than 25 per cent below last year ' s value.
And while Turkey’s car sector has shown a positive turn in the first 10 months of this year by last year, the 11 months of 2021 have already turned out to be 0.3% worse than last year’s.
The reason for the fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November was 29% relative to the dollar.
This has led to a fall in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 UXO entities received a deferral on credit payments in 2021
The first Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smaïlov, spoke about the situation of small- and medium-sized business benefits, handing over to the MIA Correspondent, Cazinform.
“On the basis of information from the Agency for the Regulation and Development of the Financial Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan, this year, in response to a request from the Head of State of 1 April 2021, the Agency's Chairman issued Order No. 127 of 9 April 2021 approving the Order for the Deferral of Loans for Small- and Medium-Sized Business Entities,” Alihan Smaïlov wrote in his response to a parliamentary request.
He recalled that the arrangement for the deferral of loan payments by banks and micro-financed entities provided for the deferral of payments of loans issued by 1 April 2021 to UXO entities, including IPs, from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the subject of the HCM.
The borrower's application may have included a different period for the deferral of payments.
During the period of deferral, the claimant's work, notice of the need to pay the outstanding debt, as well as the commission's creditor's collection and other charges,” the vice-premier noted.
In 2021, the second-level banks received a request for a stay of payments to 603 BMS borrowers, of which 553 BMS entities received a stay of 9.7 billion tenge.
IFIs have applied for a stay of 131 UXO entities, of which 95 entities have been granted a stay of 105.8 million tenge,” concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Purasev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily bear the strain of "ocmire"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can bear it more easily than those with strong body protection.
Pulmonologist Sergei Purasev explained why the strain of the coronavirus may prove to be dangerous.
The cause is worth looking for in the context of the outbreak of the virus.
Scientists believe that the “ocmire” was born in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
I mean, he didn't find any resistance to immunity when he mutated.
That makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no response to the immunity, it was very fast.
Apparently, he's got these spike squirrels, spikes, maybe more than proper, their antibodies have not been cut off during mutations, commenting the pulmonologist Sergey Purasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can carry the "ocmire" more easily than those who have a strong protective response from the body.
Turns out, the strong response of the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's what happens in pneumococcal infections, when a 30-year-old dies, and old 60-year-olds don't get it.
The young man's immune response is rabid, and he's completely inadequate: where he can only threaten with a finger, he hits like a sparrow cannon, and he's got Sergey Puraisev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side-events, and the worst of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs can be bacterial and viral.
If the first one is treated very well and fast, in the second case you can often buy only the symptoms - all the hope of the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the start of intoxication of the body - temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there's the respiratory symptoms: the difficulty of breathing, the ailment in the throat, the cough.
The pain on the right or on the left, the abdominal pain can also be a sign of an emerging problem.
In the meantime, Russia can begin to immunize a 12 to 18-year-old generation by the end of the year.
The virusologist, the head of the IFTA genomic engineering lab, Pavel Wolczkov, said that this category is very active in coves.
Young people who go to school have as much contact as possible.
This is the most socially active segment, as are the children of kindergartens, "Moscow 24" by Pavel Volkoff, a virologist, the head of the IFTI genomic engineering lab.
The author’s greatest thanks for this article.
I'd love to refresh my memory...
Teath-In.
In those far-flung '70s and '80s, none of the dance floors were without the tunes of this group.
And at home, when they were going out with their friends, they danced for their music.
Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis of why obese people are the victims of a cove.
The authors of the work examined the fat tissue left behind from the bariatric surgery, and found that the fat cells, known as adiposes, could be contaminated with the coronavirus.
Immune cells in the fatty, macrophages, have also been infected, with strong inflammatory reactions.
Scientists also examined the fat tissue of patients who died of coves, and found fragments of coronavirus in the fat surrounding the various organs.
It is known that HIV and flu viruses can hide in the fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid a response to the immune system.
It's probably possible to do that, too, SARS-COV-2.
Biologist spoke of the causes of dementia
Cemin Goloshakin, a bioscientist, described the causes of dementia and how it was prevented in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, over 55 million people are affected.
The Syndrome manifests a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time it is hard for a person to be even in a familiar environment.
Holoshakin noted that neurogeneative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins are the most common causes of dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, social exclusion and lack of active cognitive activity can play a role,” he said.
Dementia is also affected by harmful habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and low-moving lifestyles.
The expert noted, among the first signs, forgetfulness, failure to focus and a decline in abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for it," added a biologist.
To prevent the outbreak of the disease, WHO recommends that the necessary level of fistrophy be maintained, cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.

Egypt has returned some 30,000 illegal artifacts
Over the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return some 30,000 artifacts that have been smuggled out of the country.
On Saturday, 11 December, Al-Hayat, the Chief Inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdus Abdul Gouad, announced this.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has been able to recover 29,300 artifacts.
Only this year, the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C., found 5,300 monuments of an ancient Egyptian civilization," he said.
Abdel Gauad specified that all artifacts that had been smuggled had been registered in the archives.
Department staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, professionals “trace global auctions and Internet sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social media.
The Chief Inspector said that cultural property was restored upon return and then displayed in museums.
He said that one of the recovered artifacts was an ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of an exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find the hand of Pharaoh Tutanhamon at the London auction.
On 4 July, Christie's Auktion House held tenders on which a bench over 3000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million roubles).
This led to Egypt’s dissatisfaction.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutanchamon, pictured as the sun god of Amon, has been kept in a private collection and has not been traded since 1985.
How the heirloom got to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of antiquities that have been illegally removed from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of the antiquities smuggled are the result of an archaeological search of black diggers.
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and that's right, because the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent people (near the Turks).
If you want to add more, there are only 42,000 people, so many Tatars live in Crimea (see the census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people is two words!
It only brings together a Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants to have access to the employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires his employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is, in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not give its employees a corporate telecommunications device, but instead offers a discount for the purchase of a mobile phone or a smart phone from a telecommunications partner.
Under the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to deal with business with colleagues or clients.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if a staff member used it to meet a client who was not approved by the Credit Suisse.
Now, after many of the staff have moved to a remote mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all the devices that have been used to deal with the working issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank ' s management has set a time limit for staff to learn about the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Jesenin's life - 1925 - has been fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the Earth's being a poet and his "ego."
He's already out of any literal association, he's splintered with imaginism, he's on his own, but he's a well-known, reputed, sometimes he's a strong critic, even angrily, but the reader is ready to wear it in his arms.
Over 60 poems have been written in a year, many of them masterpieces, the "Persidian Motives" round, the "Anna Sneguinea" poem, eight books, the "Soviet Rose" compilation.
And the main success is that in late June 25, the State Party entered into a treaty with Jesenin to publish his essays in the third volume.
Not one of the modern-day Sergey Alexandrovich poets has been so honored, he's the first!
In addition, it was very good money, with a fee of 1,000 roubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 roubles per month, the engineer 200).
The funds that year were needed more than ever.
Jesenin married the granddaughter of Tolstoy Tolstoy, who needed to set up a family life, to support the sisters Katya and Sacha, as well as the mother.
It's like life's been built up, there's something to be happy about, but for him, it's mostly colored in a dark tone, like a black man's nightmare, written in November 1925, and published after Jesenin's death:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where the pain came from.
Is the wind fluttering?
Over an empty and barren field,
Like a plant in September,
It's brainwashing the liquor.
A lot of people I know have said that Jesenin has given up a lot, he looks bad, he's clearly sick.
There's a lot of repetitiveness, nervous breaks.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
If, however, such a diagnosis of alcoholism was made by Sergei Alexandrovich, there were no valid documents left.
Let's say, in May 1923, when Jesenin, at the insistence of her fourth wife, American Icedore Duncan was in a clinic in Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (again he will receive Jesenin two years later, already in Moscow).
And here's the evidence of the poet's singing, the scandals on the ground, the police's getting a lot of hits-- dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, a terrible novel of a poet with a green snake has been evolving rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Jesenin settled for a short time with a friend named Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Jesenin, with his very good income, never had a place to live either in Moscow or in Peter, was found in rented apartments, in hotels, or in acquaintances.
Old men remember:
"He'd only come to sleep at night, and in most cases in a crazy, drunk state.
One day, returning at 4 a.m., Jesenin fell on the stairwell...
He fell, scratched his face and snore.
After a while, he coughed up, spattering all over the sheet with blood."
And Jesenin himself, after his trip to Europe and the United States (there was a dry law in the States at the time, but Duncan brought with her a decent supply of liquor) admitted:
"I didn't see anything but boobs and streets...
I'm at the end of the day, and people don't remember...
Well, I've been drinking, of course...
And I've been drinking 'cause I'm bored."

Promtex-Orient 100x195 Duet Latex Conom
The Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom is a modern performance of the budget model in the premium class.
The base of the mattress is the block of the independent double springs of Duet.
A softer spring of small size is inserted inside the big spring.
This makes it possible to distribute the load evenly on the mattress.
The mattress on both sides is filled with artificial latex.
It's the analogy of natural latex, but it's more dense and less expensive.
The flexibility and elasticity of this material increases the comforting effect of the mattress.
Artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it doesn't absorb water and dust.
The mattress is a good match for a pair with a big difference in weight (30 kg).
With the smart springs, there's no wave effect when the lighter partner rolls on the side of the heavy.

He's a lot more responsible than I was when I was his age or my husband, who had a problem with the law until the wedding.
Father takes care of his young daughter.
And he likes, as the Lermonts wrote, "wrong love."
Why would the girl cry at the exam before she failed?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't school?
Well, she'll have a tail.
So what?
He will.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus is using migrants as a “arms” against the EU.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as a “arms”
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pavel of Yablonski, expressed the view that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, used the refugees as a “arms” against the European Union and intended to return to such a “operation” next year.
In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a statement.
According to Jablonski, the sanctions against Belarus “stopped Lukashenko for a time,” but he is“ active in the search for new ways”.
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many places in the world”.
As Kp.ru writes, the European Union has previously put in place a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It addressed 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, there was a commitment to continue to expand restrictive measures against the Republic “unless the situation in the country improves”.
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by Senka hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man a laugh
The world's events in 2021 were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first person to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
As early as September, at the premiere of "No Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet robe jacket and a traditional Bond butterfly.
He was followed up on two occasions by Prince William, who first put on the Eco-Price award of the Earthshot Prize, which was not in line with the royal dress code, a green velvet jacket, and then selected a more classic version for an event in support of Royal Variety philanthropy.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was used to try out on itself and on Lionel the Messianic.
The footballer has come to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in Dolce & Gabbana's velvet jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed the same way.
AliExpress has already noted a growing demand for men's velvet jackets in Russia.
According to analytics at the Gaceta.Ru, they have been purchased 1.4 times more.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with silhouette and silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, beard, dark blue, and, of course, black.
The average cost of such models ranges from 3,000 to 6000 roubles, and men prefer to buy their own suits, and they choose their suits less.
It's not just online.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next, and Zara.
In the luxe segment, the velvet jackets for this season are presented in almost all brands - and Briony, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The Gucci model is considered the most desirable, in which it appeared at one of the premieres of the film "Gucci House" by the massador of the brand of Jared Letto.
By choosing the jackets of expensive stamps, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
A special twirling technology is used to produce a dense fabric with a porous exterior texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but are therefore less.
Mode expert Lamoda Ilya Wahoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, it's not his model or phase, it's his fitness.
"Barhat requires evening light, so a jacket like this is ideal if you're going to a party or a gala event," explains Wahoshkin. "It'll be appropriate if the invitation has a Black Tie dress code or a Creative Black Tie.
Another important criterion for making a choice in favour of a velvet jacket is the status of the buyer.
"The man in the velvet jacket, first of all, has to have the right advanced party with the means," the Telegram-Canal says, "The Beauty Brammell male fashion." "The owner of the velvet jackets is usually a caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They're just invited to side-events where the dress code is always set.
Ilya Wahoshkin proposes to mix a jacket from a velvet with the same nice things: classic trousers with arrows, one-tone shirts, silk ties, loofers with brushes, pins.
Too simple and day-to-day things would look inappropriate.
The fashionable experts at Brahmell's Beauty are sure that it would be inappropriate to have a private employee on the company in a velvet jacket, and if it's a "man of the bosses who run the event, it's a "yes," it's a thing of the subject.
If an employee's rank is lower, and his aim is to move up in the company's complex hierarchies or to get his financial bonuses out, it's best not to wear a velvet jacket.
The guide will certainly appreciate it with the phrase "not on the Senka hat," the Telegram editors think about the male fashion channel.
There's a very mixed sense of voice.
It's an unnatural tembrae, so painstaking.
And it's completely not associated with the cute face of a young girl.
To be fair, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But from the bottom of my heart, good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is a good lobby, that is, it's a payoff.
Billion-dollar investment.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy was also out of line - gas, oil, and coal were less expensive than they are now.
There's a wild demand for fuel.
The penny's dripping.
Then who's out there?
As usual, a private buyer.
Do Indian problems touch the Sheriff?
So we should not think Western politicians are idiots who have "defaulted" the energy crisis.
They've done their job.
For a pretty lot of money.
I didn't see any pretty people in the picture in the article.
It's just mediocrity within the average passengers.
Perhaps if such characters are so confident of their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, they'll probably not be able to fit it.
But it's just because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautifuls" but not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is aware of his slave position and is fighting it, is a revolutionist.
A slave who is not aware of his slavery and who is living in a silent, unconscious and silent slave life is just a slave.
A slave who is drooling when he self-consciously describes the delights of the slave life, and is enthralled by a good and good master, is a hooligan.
The immunologist said that re-accination in four to five months would help to protect himself from the strain of the coronavirus "omicron "
Revacation in four or five months can protect you from a new strain of coronavirus infection.
This was the statement made by immunologist Nikolai Kruchkov, who called the inoculation six months later, given the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period"
"In previous strains, this period was normal, but now it's best to do the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic illnesses in four," the expert said, in parallel with the vaccination campaign, to re-accine.
Hitchkov also noted that early re-accination provides a good type of antibodies to neutralize.
"If a man was given two shots and a booster, or was sick and immunized, or immunized and sick, he was given a "hybrid immunity," i.e. a lot of antibodies, and neutralize enough," the expert clarified.
The Group of Seven warned Russia of “small-scale consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The G-7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States) issued a statement on the outcome of the Liverpool MFA summit.
It emphasizes that Russia's “war aggression” against Ukraine “will have immense consequences and will cost a great deal” in Moscow, but the specific measures are not described in the document.
“We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine,” states the statement.
The ministers further call on Russia to “reduce the escalation, use the diplomatic channels, and meet its international obligations with regard to the transparency of military activities,” as US President Biden spoke of during a video call to President Putin of the Russian Federation on 7 December.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandian format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements with a view to a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine”, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the G-7 also state.
Any use of force to alter borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have immense consequences and a serious price in return,” they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as to the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine ' s abstinence.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response,” the statement also states.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Trass, stated that Russia would have “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, the meeting had shown “the single voice of the G-7 countries, which accounted for 50 per cent of global GDP, and which had made it very clear that an invasion of Ukraine would have a huge impact on Russia.
The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective from the omicron-stamp.
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron-stamp coronavirus is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
This is what scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong have come to the conclusion, transmitting South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective on the basis of a study of anti-virus activity in citizens who received two doses of COVID-19.
"We see that most people have a high level of anti-virus activity against the original version of Sars-Cov-2, but this ability has been significantly reduced against omicron-variousness," said Professor Malick Peerys.
Scientists stressed, however, that vaccines remain the most reliable way to protect against the severe current of the disease when contaminating the coronavirus.
Scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had previously predicted the development of a coronavirus pandemic in view of the omikron-stamma impact.
The authors of the study found that the Omicron-Tam could cause a new wave of viral circulation and an increase in mortality if no further action was taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine accused the Federation of blocking the supply of NATO arms to Kyiv
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Resnikov, accused the Government of former Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition by Kyiv of lethal weapons within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on 12 December, Resnikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed the purchase by Ukraine of anti-sniper systems and rifles to kill drones.
It is noted, however, that Berlin has since softened its position on the rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kyiv intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned arms within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
These include the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, and France.
The FT notes, however, that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the authorization of arms transfers to Ukraine is still unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany, Andrei Melnik, expressed the view that Kyiv should not expect Berlin to deliver arms to chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany attributed its refusal to provide arms to the risk of a military escalation of the conflict in Donbassa despite the “occupation by Russia” of a part of Ukrainian territory.
The same "unlogical" position, I'm sure the diplomat will keep Germany at the new chancellor.
In August, the Ukrainian leader, Wladimir Zelenski, said that Kyiv was waiting for help from Berlin to equip the marine.
In Ukraine, Germany is expected to “maintain Ukraine's partner in a technical sense”, added the President.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, Robert Habek, co-chair of the Federation Green Party, visited the Republic, where he advocated for the sale of defensive weapons to Kyiv.

Mercedes protested against the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi
The German crew of the Mercedes, whose pilot Lewis Hamilton at the Abud Daby Grand Prix finished second after Red Bull, Max Ferstoppen, protested the final result of the race, reports the press service for Formula One.
Mercedes considers that the rules of Formula One 48.12 and 48.8 were violated in the course of the race.
In the first case, the German team is challenging the decision of the judges to return to round riders in the same circle as the leaders.
According to the second, Ferstoppen outstrips Hamilton to the "restart" zone.
Let's add that now the result of the Grand Prix Abu Dhabi, according to which Ferstoppen outrun Hamilton by 2.256 seconds and won the Formula One World Cup, is pre-emptive when the Mercedes protest is not known.
G7 warns Russia of responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine
The G7 foreign ministers warned of the “serious consequences” for Russia if it continued its military aggression against Ukraine, as stated in the final statement of the parties.
The Meeting also noted that it condemned the upsurge of Russian armed forces at the country ' s borders.
“The Russian Federation must have no doubt that the continued military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and costs,” states a statement published on the British Government's website.
The G7 Ministers and the EU High Representative noted that “the condemnation of Russian armed reinforcement and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine is united”.
The head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Elizabeth Trass, at a press conference in Liverpool, warned of the “major consequences” for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
G7 wanted Russia to give up its aggression against Ukraine," she said (the TASS quote).
Previously, at the Liverpool summit, the G7 foreign ministers agreed that the parties needed to return to the negotiating table to resolve the crisis due to the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine.
It was a “Norman-style” negotiation.
The North-Atlantic Alliance also spoke for the dialogue on Ukraine in the “Norman-style”.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Maria Zecharaova, stated that, in calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries “were in a position to take responsibility for their own mistakes”.

Ways of recovering the money stolen from the Internet shops have been discovered
There are a number of ways to get back the money that was stolen from the Internet shops and not be the victim of future fraud.
They were discovered by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
For example, in order to reduce the risk of major losses when bank card data fall into the hands of intruders, it is recommended to keep the basics on a card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be set aside to the savings account and withdrawn as needed.
The experts also recommend that a separate card be set up for online purchases.
If the money was stolen from shops that do not use the 3D Secure security technology, you can start a return procedure.
“Under the rules established by the payment systems for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, the liability rests with the participant in the payment chain who does not use the service,” the representative of the Promsbank clarified.
The expert from the international payment provider Ecompay, Arthur Zaremba, stressed that the buyer was entitled to file an application with the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the perpetrator used an online map that does not require two-factor authorisation, the transaction can be protested and the money returned.
It is noted that, in some cases, Internet shops themselves return the funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent in.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Chamber, the Director of the League of Secure Internet, Catherine Mizulin, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 cases of fraud, from the sale of forged documents to the the theft of personal data, had been received.
She said that a single window for online fraud complaints could be an effective solution in the current circumstances.
Scholz has come to Poland to discuss the “North Flow 2” and EU legislation.
The newly elected German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has come to Warsaw to talk about the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops at Ukraine's borders, and the situation with the Russian North Stream-2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz has expressed his desire to maintain a good relationship between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries have expressed clear expectations from one another.
The Prime Minister of Poland, Mateus Moravetski, stated that he would call on Sholtz to oppose the North Stream 2, for which Russian gas was to be transported to Germany bypass Ukraine.
According to Moravetski, Russia can use a gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political compulsion.
Germany, in turn, supported Poland ' s efforts to halt the flow of migrants seeking to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels to address the crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for the disagreement.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party “Right and Justice” were in violation of EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its Supreme Court ruled that national legislation was a priority over EU regulations.
The new German government, which was sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not made a public commitment to halt the work of Northflow 2 in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told Congressmen that they had reached an understanding with Germany about stopping the gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, and a senior U.S. Congressman reported on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia was in breach of Ukraine's border, a position that was confirmed by the G-7 on Sunday.

The Minzifreys want to give the writers residences.
The future Russian Literary Support Fund will be transferred by the State to the federal property that has been inherited from the Union of USSR Writers and the USSR Literary Foundation.
It will set up authorly residences, inform the Parliament's Gazette in Mincifra, which will be the founder of the foundation.
The Ministry of the Interior is preparing a draft presidential decree on the creation of a Russian Literary Support Fund.

Doctors warned of the risk of long-term use of blood-fluiding drugs after COVID-19 and before vaccination.
Doctors Irina Yartsev and Sergey Tokarev warned of the risk of unchecked use of blood-reducing drugs after having a coronavirus infection of COVID-19 and before being immunized against coronavirus.
Doctor-therapeut, immunologist Irina Jartsev, said that prevention of possible clots after COVID-19 could cause a stroke.
Yartzew explained that the blood-reducing drugs were not intended for everyone, except if the patient was hospitalized, was in a hospital, and was found to have complications.
The doctor assigns anticoagulants (blood-reducing drugs, inhibiting the over-crowding) on the basis of evidence.
She reported that there was now a blackout - everyone in a row was drinking anticoagulants for a long time, and that this was the background for complications in the form of haemorrhagic strokes (blooding to the brain).
The Chief Prophylaxis of URFO, the Scientific Head of the Society of Preventive Medicines, and the Doctor of Medical Sciences, Sergei Tokarev, in a conversation with URA.RU, said that the anticoagulants in Russia are now often used before vaccines against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe in questionable tips on the Internet and begin to self-medicate.
There are citizens who, by their decision, begin to take anticoagulants a week before the vaccination.
And in the pre-screening before the inoculation, the doctors see the hemorrhages.
He stressed that it was extremely dangerous to take any medication without knowing the cause of any symptom.

The money we found in the church wall is going to pay $20,000 to the plumber.
The plumber who found the money in the church wall in the U.S. state of Texas will receive the award.
This is reported in a press release by a non-profit organization, Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in the main Evangelical Church of Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austen preaches, promising that God - fearing Christians will be rich and prosperous.
In November 2021, a plumber, Justin Cowley, renovated one of the church toilets and found thousands of bags of money and cheques in thermal insulation.
He handed over the discovery to the church and, he said, didn't even get a thank-you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We know what you've done and what you could do," quotes KPRC-TV.
Apparently, the find is related to the theft that took place at the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
At the time, about $200,000 in cash and 400,000 in the form of checks that were kept in the church's safe.
The money was insured, so the church didn't lose it.
Still, a $25,000 award was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Caughley could not claim that amount, as the award was over.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Creeme Steppers of Houston, which in due course made an award of $5,000 and later received an additional $20,000 in a gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's integrity.
He'll get $20,000.
It was previously reported that the police had interrogated Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the Lakewood wall.
Tanya, her words, her actions, that's her characterization of "like a real man."
That's why the attitude is so negative.
And it's not that "she's financially much richer than all the writers," as they write.
There are people who are richer, but not everyone is as insolent as this lady.

China has a new case of human infection with avian flu virus.
A new case of human infection with avian flu of H5N6 is found in China.
The radio station RTHK, with a reference to the Hong Kong health authorities, has reported this, and has sent it to TASS.
Infected by a 68-year-old in the city of Huayzhou in the southern province of Guangdong, who kept a pet farm.
His condition is considered critical by the medical profession.
The world's first H5N6 strain of humans was reported in May 2014 in the south-west province of Sichuan.
Since then, there have been 53 such cases in the country.
In Brazil, citizens were required to submit their passports on entry to the country
In Brazil, Judge Luis Roberto Barros of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) ordered the entry of a covid-passer.
CNN Brasil reports this.
Citizens who have anti-impensive vaccines have been released from the production of a vaccination certificate.
Also on the list of exceptions are those who have come from countries where the lack of a vaccine has been proven.
“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, Pre-Carnival and Carnival parties, as well as other events, with an increase in the flow of turf,” observed Barroza.
The Brazilian authorities had previously ordered unfeeling coronavirus-infected tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
A complete COVID-19 protection scheme is open
A virologist, a doctor of medical science, a well-deserved Russian scientist, Anatoly Altstein, in an interview with Ura.ru, revealed a scheme of full protection against coronavirus infection.
This, he said, can be achieved by injecting and using a solo vaccine.
In the case of internal use, a large number of immunoglobulin A is produced. In the case of a vaccine, this is not the case.
Immunoglobulins A protect the muscular, so the virus can't infiltrate the body.
And inside, we have the most immunoglobulins in G (antital).
And if you put in both vaccines, you get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's no solution for a double vaccine yet," the medic said.
The Chief Prophylaxis of URFO, Dr. Sergei Tokarev, in turn stated that the main advantage of the use of inoculation together with the injection is the ability to stop being the bearer of COVID-19.
He added that this would help in such a way that the protection of the body was supposed to be the maximum.
Previously, the Minister of Health of the Nedgorod Region, David Melick-Guseynov, stated that a new upsurge in the COVID-19 pandemic would result in the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
He said that that was the case in other countries, where another wave of pandemics had come earlier.
Inna, uh...
I've been talking to a booby (dead a long time ago) like this - if you're ready to change a warm house, feed, love, love, and game for a real bitch, go ahead.
But the pesel was trained and smart.
He chose my company and went home.
In a video way that works in 90% of the cases.
Not from the ceiling, trust me.
I've been slowing down a lot of hosts to keep the dog out of the way, even though they've got to get out there, 200 grand running, right by the arm, and taking it the other way.
So the "200,000" chose the owner, not the dog who ran out there.
In Europe, massive protesting by opponents of vaccines is not halting
More than 40,000 protesters entered the streets in the Austrian capital, Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against coves compulsory.
As of February next year, unfavorable people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 Euros.
The Spaniards, indignant at the health-care policy of the authorities, waged a peace march in Madrid.
Some of them had placards in their hands saying, "This is a false pandemic," "I'm not going to immunize."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the Autonomous Community, cove-certificate is compulsory for access to bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, nursing homes and night-time entertainment.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports has been taken by the authorities in a number of regions of the country against the background of an increase in the incidence of coronavirus.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR-codes.
The action began in a peaceful manner, but then it turned into a confrontation with the guards of order.
A group of protesters began to throw rocks at the police.
In response, law enforcement officials used water wells.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia, there is no consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Ruday is also labeled "the first Russian doctor, the doctor of medicine," probably because she began her studies earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve this title.
But one thing I agree with Zechariah is that the Americans only carried death and ransacking to any country, wherever it may appear.

WHO has found “omicron” in six dozen States
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the new strain of the coronavirus has been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain can have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported in a WHO report.
According to the organization, as of 9 December, 63 countries have been identified in all six WHO regions.
This is because it has only been active since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of proliferation of the new version of the coronavirus.
WHO experts fear that the new strain from preliminary data can bypass the “delta” strains, the Indian version of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all countries without exception.
Prior to that, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tederos Adhanom Hebreyesus, stated that the Omicron-stum could have a significant impact on the progress of the Coronavirus Pandemic.
A similar conclusion was reached in the United Kingdom.
The experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the “omicron” will replace the “detail” in the coming months.
And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is when the official “omicrone” in the Kingdom is currently suffering from a few hundred people, and an estimate of up to 10,000.
The British experts are predicting tens of thousands of deaths from the amicron strain, and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals every day.
What the British health system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
The way the Russian "Satellite V" reacts to the "omicron" is not yet known, and this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaley Center has just begun to test the Russian vaccine on the amicron strain.

Curious squirrel, you're right, Internet communication is a very different thing, it's easy and easy to talk, and there's nothing to say in person.
And to see a man in person, maybe it's not what you're expecting, it didn't touch, so that's the way it is.
When you meet your man, you'll change your mind.
And again, Soviet time is called "the time of demons."
At that time, people had much more faith in God than they do today.
In fact, they have been raised by God’s laws (love of one another, do not steal, etc.).
What an ideology today is money at all costs.
Chattons like Globe of faith are small (not at all), but even so, the time of demons has come in the '90s...

Israeli Premier Bennet reported on the start of the school vaccinations
The Israeli Ministry of Health has been launching an emergency programme to increase vaccination since Sunday.
In the morning of December 12, Coronavirus was immunized in schools all over Israel.
The Prime Minister of the Jewish State, Naftali Bennet, at this meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers, said that the issue of the vaccination of a fourth dose of at-risk citizens would also be examined.

The Israelis are inoculated with Pfizer.
As of January 10, last year, the immunized began to receive a second dose.
Vaccination of 12-15-year-olds in the country began in early June this year.
Today, more than 5.78 million people have received both doses of vaccination, and the third has received more than 4.12 million citizens.

In Brazil, seven people died as a result of the rain
At least seven people have been killed and 175 have been hit by massive rains in the north-eastern state of Bahia and its neighbour, Minas Gerais.
This is reported to the TASS with reference to the rescue services.
At the border of these states, an extra-tropical cyclone has been raging since mid-week, bringing the region to a level of 450 mm. 25 municipalities in the state of Bahia have declared a state of emergency, some of which have become the most devastating in 35 years.
A number of bridges, two river dams, have been destroyed, and three tracks have been blocked.
According to the rescue team, some 57 000 people have been left homeless, and another 6,700 have been forced to leave their homes.
More than 85,000 people in the region have been affected by the disaster.

$135 billion in apps - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user costs in applications rose by 25 per cent worldwide, while downloads rose by 8 per cent.
The world's most popular are the various videos.
Most users downloaded the CapCut video editor, and spent the most on YouTube.
Both the number of downloads and user costs of the application showed a significant increase between January and November 2021.
The number of downloads rose by 8 per cent to 140 billion. The cost of the apps has increased by 25 per cent, to a record $135 billion.
The data was published by App Annie, an analytical company, which submitted a report on the market for mobile applications in 2021.
In 2021, the world economy emerged from the locust and began a post-pandemic recovery.
“Will such a “return to the physical” economy of the apps slow down? none,” the authors of the report believe.
India has been the leader of the downloads, accounting for about 20 per cent of all downloads.
It is followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of iOS gadgets continued to spend more than users of Android: iOS accounted for 65% of the total cost in the apps.
Among the applications, CapCut's video editor was the top downloader in 2021.
It is followed by two Indian apps, the MX TakaTak Video Service and the Mesho online trade app.
The top 10 also includes Telegram.
In general, VPN-services (the top 10 two - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and the video production and broadcasting services (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, the top 10 include two more - Moj and SnackVideo).
"Most users have spent on live and online spotting apps," notes the report.
Youtube is also the head of this site, with a top-5 user cost, including a TikTok video service, Disney+ and HBO Max, as well as a Japanese Piccoma manga subscription service.
Telegram, Instagram, Zoom, and TikTok are the first users to be active on a monthly basis, blocking the top-5 mobile version of Microsoft Office.
In Russia, the number of downloads in a year was a shopping app by AliExpress.
It is followed by a Zenly service, which shows the location of the friends, and still the same CapCut.
Also in the top 10 applications are: StarMaker's online caraoke, Sheen's online dress-reader, the Maps for Minecraft PE application, the online DiDiDi cab-order service, the YouTube Pure Tuber client, the Dixie Ritell application, and the Samoan online shop.
Worldwide, people have adapted to the pandemic by moving to a life in a mobile, which is one of the main conclusions.
The industries that have been most successful have helped people to get closer, both virtually and in person,” commented the report by the head of the Apple Annnie Marketing Research Department, Lexi Sidow.
The profit from the mobile game sector in 2021 was $90 billion. The number of downloads turned out to be cosual and hyper-soft-out games, with little or no feature, and the video is minimal.
The top three of the world's most popular games included Count Masters, the Makeover Project, and Bridge Race.
In Russia, DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls, and Phone Case DYY are leading the game.
==Prognosis==App Annie previously presented its 2022 prognosis.
Among the main trends of the following year, the company’s analysts called the rise in the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the increase in popularity in the Z generation of financial apps, such as the Robinhood Investors’ Apps, and the further rise in the popularity of metaversive mobile games.

The Russians have been warned of a new scheme of cons
The intruders began to look for new maneuvers to cheat on video messages.
It's written by "The News" with a reference to experts.
According to the Ivideon Products Director, Zaur Aboulimov, the main risk associated with the distribution of videos is dopey.
In this case, fraudsters make a fake video based on the actual records of the victim.
So neurosets are able to accurately reproduce the characteristics of a person’s behavior.
Aboulimov added that by using the doppheik, intruders could call the victim ' s acquaintances via video link or make a video of a man to send out for blackmail.
"Such forgery can easily trigger a bulling, as a misguided intruder can put people in a ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenario," the expert said.
The leading system engineer, Varonis Alexander Vetkol, in turn, said that psychologically, people have more trust in others when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of video-based technologies.
David, add.
In what I wrote above, I focused on what I was buying in a small city, where the local mentality didn't let you wear too much makeup and walk in short skirts, and show your stockings and panties on your legs.

Five actions are listed to help avoid diabetes mellitus
Problems with blood sugar are one of the most common in the world.
Some, however, do not attach much importance to this, and it is not.
Over time, sugar diabetes can result in serious complications, even death.
Preventive measures play a key role in preventing the generation of diseases.
For example, the doctors recommend a change in the drinking system - a reduction in the number of diverse beverages and a change in the use of common water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods increase blood sugar to a dangerous level when over-used.
So the first step on the way to a healthy way of life is to stop buying candy and keeping it at home.
The disease is affected not only by poor diet, but also by bad habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, we need to make a lot of progress.
The experts suggest that we keep a low-carbon diet.
Such a diet will not only help to lower the weight, but will also help to protect against abrupt changes in the level of sugar.
You need to eat a lot of cellular to protect you from diabetes.
The food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to a sense of sourness, digestive juices, and an increase in the uptake of food.

Dr. Pavlova told us about the "little-day migraine" in the workaholics.
A number of factors can lead to a deterioration of health on weekends
The reason for the deterioration in health after workdays is often the “migrenium of the day off”, explained by a well-known medical doctor, a doctor in medical science, a senior researcher at the Department of Basic Medicine of the MGU, and a researcher at the Zuhra Pavlov Hospital of Systemic Medicine in his telegramme.
She said that it was particularly common for workaholics to suffer from headache, breakage, and weakness during the weekend.
Dr. Pavlova pointed out that, in addition to a week’s accumulated fatigue, there are quite a number of objective reasons for the body’s negative reaction to the changes in conditions.
This weekend, our life changes dramatically.
"We sleep for a long time, we lie on the couch all day, we probably eat more, and we drink less," the doctor reasoned.
Because of overeating and lack of water, it's heavy and broken."
An extra role is played by the late upturn.
So if you get up three hours after normal, you get a reaction called jetlag.
It's found in travelers who cross a number of time zones.
To determine which of the factors is critical to the deterioration of health, Pavlova recommended that we see what changes most during the weekend.

South African scientists have said that Pfizer's vaccine against the "omicron" is not very effective.
In South Africa, Pfizer's vaccine was said to be under-efficient against "omicron"
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa have conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron-stamp coronavirus infection.
It is estimated to be 22.5 per cent of the vaccine's anti-sufficient anti-sufficient (“omicron neutralization”), which... casts doubt on the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, says a study published on the MedRxiv Portal.
In doing so, experts clarified that the drug can save the disease from a severe current.
Previously, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the omicron-stam of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemics in Britain with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How many hidden sugars are there in the usual foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutritious nutrients.
Its excess in diet can result in type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should bear in mind that an unknown word in the product may include hidden sugar, an ingredient similar to sugar in the calorie, composition and gliquemic index.
The label can include several dozen names, in fact sugar.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fruit.
There may also be other dried sugars, such as dextrose (sugar from maize), left-handed sugar (fruit sugar), melassa (black stream), agave syrup, etc.
They're all simple carbohydrates, which are mono- and dysaxarides, and they can be not only in baking, but also in ketchup, doctoral sausage, bread, etc.
The best way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and to the many different names of sugar.
The different sugars are different in taste, but whatever the name of the ingredient in the product is - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still stays sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is not just the amount of sugar specified by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruit, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar can be much higher than the label.
German chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance to the German Federation in 25 years
The new Federal Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said that the import of gas was losing importance to Germany, as the country continued to decolonize the economy.
He said that Germany was planning to give up all gas, oil, and coal by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years, the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continued to be committed to the future transport of Russian natural gas by Ukraine, as it was now an important resource for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement expressing Berlin’s support for Ukraine’s energy transformation.
Previously, the head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Annalena Berbock, stated that the process of certification of the Northern Flux 2 gas pipeline was in progress.
According to the Minister, in the context of the coalition negotiations and the negotiation of a coalition treaty, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The Diplomat also indicated that the pipeline is still “not in line with the EU requirements”.

The hackers hacked the Indian Prime Minister's Twitter
The hackers hacked the Indian Prime Minister's Twitter account, Narendra Modi.
The intruders have been able to publish a fake message.
It has been reported that India has allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal means of payment, as well as that it has already purchased cryptovalite.
Modi's office has been asked to ignore new messages.
The Premier stated that on Twitter, a quick response was made - access to the account was restored.
The page of the Indian Premier was already hacked in 2020 and was called upon to make donations to the foundation by means of a cryptovalut.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, a majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted in a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third ballot was much lower than in the previous two.
According to the preliminary results published by the local authorities, 3.51 per cent (2,755) of New Caledonians voted in favour of the “independence of France”, while 96.49 per cent (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90 per cent, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians taking part in the elections.
As France-Presse commented, “the origin of these elections left no room for doubt,” as the supporters of independence called on the voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed it on 12 December, considering that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago was hindering a full and “honest” campaign.
This non-participation has thus paved the way for the third victory of French New Caledonian supporters, following the referenda held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence, and 53.3 per cent in 2020.
According to the separatists, they do not accept the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the United Nations.
On Sunday, 12 December, the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, was told at the Elysée Palace to address the referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia ' s independence has, to a large extent, revived the last weeks of the French presidential campaign.
A number of presidential candidates expressed their preference for the Territory to remain in France, as it was “the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific Ocean”.
“New Caledonia must always remain French,” Eric Zemmour repeated on many occasions.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate, Valery Pecress, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, calling on the Kaledonians to stay French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it's not his responsibility."
Still, the President added, "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed “the strong desire that the choice of the caledonians be France's choice”.
Light, oh, hi!

Just remember that the food was natural, so obesity was not as common as it is now.
But medicine was at zero - leeches, garlic, and cookies.

And the food has nothing to do with it.
In Turkey, the world's first laser-armed drone was tested
The first laser-armed drone in the world has been successfully tested in Turkey.
"Eren" was tested at a distance of between 100 and 500 m, according to Mir24.
The machine is able to neutralize explosive objects at a distance with a laser.
The maximum flight height is 3000 m.
After the relevant tests, the UAVs must enlist the arms of the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy the explosive devices without the use of deminers.
The Agency stresses that Turkey is among the six countries in the world that are able to develop and produce their own drones.

WSJ readers critical of Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision for Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West was allegedly offering Ukraine as a sacrifice to Russia.
In his article, he is persuading readers of the danger from Moscow, and he has allowed a number of insulting remarks to be made against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of Hartwell called on the Western countries to “show a united front against Russia”.
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American Professor.
"There's a lot of false information in this article," the RIA News quotes from one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to lose it, and Ukraine is not our land.
The US and NATO allies will never go to a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine,” another remarked.
Patches can also be used in the area of lips.
Used in the Derboo Peach and Hibiscus Brightening Hydrogel Eie Patch is a high-tech polymer that provides increased insulation and transfer to the skin of a highly concentrated natural plant essension, which is tightly attached to the skin and gives a sense of freshness.
In the transfer of nutrients to the skin, hydrogel minimalizes the associated loss of moisture and causes essension to penetrate the deep skin.

An Earthquake of a magnitude of 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands
An Earthquake of a magnitude of 5.2 occurred next to Chicotan, a Kurian island.
It is noted that the epicentre of the earthquake was 231.8 km north-east of the city of North Kurilsk.
The occipital area was 92.5 km in depth.
Previously, seismologists observed an earthquake of 7.5 in Peru, in which 10 people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new-generation jet drones.
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, a type of ANKA-type UAV will be launched.
This was reported on 11 December by the freelance adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian President, Alexei Arestovic.
So they're able to act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against the airborne man-made.
They're gonna have Ukrainian motors and the rest of the Turkish airline: the hull and so on," quotes the dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA, he said it was a jet, not a piston drone.
He said it's a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which is beyond it "by all characteristics."
The first round of UAVs was to be made by the plant at the end of the following year, and he concluded the arrest.
The ANKA aircraft was set up by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the day, Ukraine's General Staff secreted data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin rockets in the military operations of the combined forces in Donbassa.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine, Wladimir Zelenski, reported that a modern military drone plant was under construction.
He said that Ukraine intended to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Defence Department entered into an agreement to build a centre in Kyiv oblast to train personnel, and to test and service the Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press office of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memo a "more real step forward."
Two lions escaped from the container at the airport.
At Chungi Airport in Singapore, the lions fled.
This is reported by The Streets Times.
Two predators managed to get out of a container with seven lions on one of the planes.
The publication notes that the country from which they have been brought to Singapore and to which they have been sent is unknown.
One of the runaway lions lay on the top of the container.
The animals couldn't get away from it because of the safety net set up next to them.
The opposition was over after the arrival at the airport of Mandai Wildlife Group, which runs all the Singapore zoos.
They have demobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and are planning to bring them to the quarantine facility.
In Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, it has been reported that the lion has fled the landlord and has been wandering the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and no harm was done to the people.
The experts warned of the risk of cancer due to vitamin B9
Research has shown that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the publication of the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less at risk of having some types of cancer, in particular colorful.
In contrast, however, the excess of the necessary dosage contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietologist Beth Kitchin, advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
Optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer is only increased if it is substantially diverged from this number in a larger or a smaller way.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, making sure to keep up for dosage, and avoiding cereals and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, a nutrition consultant, Rachel Feyn, called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Since it is, among other things, in avocados, Fein has recommended that men, after 50 years, eat more of this foetus.
In the United Kingdom, about 75,000 people can die by April.
Forecasts by British scientists show that the proliferation of the omicron-stam of the coronavirus in the next five months in England can kill up to 75,000 people if the restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
The Guardian, referring to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), has reported this to TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of the British Cabinet ' s Scientific and Resource Group on Emergencies, by April 2022, the country would have recorded at least 25,000 deaths due to the omicron strain, with a total hospitalization of some 175,000 patients.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 people per day.
“Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to prevent the National Health Service from overburdening if the omicron-stam is more contagious than the delta option, and the current vaccines will not be able to prevent the infection,” said the mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
The British Health Safety Agency has previously reported that if the current rate of omicron-stamp distribution is maintained, about 1 million infections will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, however, the omicron strain can become dominant in the United Kingdom.
There are currently 1,898 cases in Britain of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
On 9 December, however, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sageed Javid, indicated that, in fact, the figure could already be as high as 10,000.

The demand for superhulls has grown in the world by a quarter.
Building superhulls this year, and ordering for next year, the world's record-breaking, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and to combat climate change.
The number of yachts ordered in the world registry was 1,200, a quarter more than last year.
In an era of fighting the effects of climate change for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the will and the money for a floating fortress for 50 million pounds or more will not decline, writes the Guardian.
But there are more and more of them.
This year, 25 per cent more vessels have been ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say it's been 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear contamination on land and prefer to run off from a pandemic on their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If all of these people used to go to the office and meet with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and are negotiating in the winter.
Broker Will Christie told the paper that the yards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that the customers are willing to pay more so that their yacht can be ready for at least a year or two earlier.
"People just hunt for freedom, and super-rich people can afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to see that in times of deprivation of space travel, life on yachts, or flying on their own jets, the public is irritating, as the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
The economists call on governments to act and suggest new taxes and rules for super-rich people, even though they realize that with such a mobility, it will be very difficult to implement.
In the meantime, only the number of super-yutes ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length of more than 100 meters.
The Norwegian billionaire Requet is building a 180-metre-long REV Ocean yacht.
After the water goes down, it's gonna be the world's biggest yacht.
The yacht has a “sun-basin pool” and a submarine designed to study the depths of the sea.
In the current super-yahts, it has become commonplace for helicopters, for open-air cinemas, and on some of them, such as the McGregor Boat, a platform for unity. Professor of Economic Anthropology at Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that in comparison to the total number of greenhouse gas selections, the carbon footprint of super-rich is not significant.
But it's symbolic, given that the multi-billionaires in the world are just over 2,000.
This is just another example of the overuse of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emissions of billionaires are thousands of times as high as the world’s average.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the world’s largest polluter, Roman Abramovic, is responsible for the 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that fell into the atmosphere in 2018.
Two-thirds of the emissary track cooled on his yacht, Eclipse, which was 162.5 meters long.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the team is still poisoning the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give a command to bring a yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Supermans don't make other people sympathize when they, like the richest woman in Australia, Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that there is no room for their giant ships to dock.
It is also hard to understand her call to build marinas for ships in excess of 50 meters.
Risky weekly dose of alcohol leading to intestinal cancer
American scientists have identified the volume of alcohol a week that increases the risk of cancer.
It's written by the Daily Express.
The experts have concluded that the use of four or more drinks a week poses a high risk of oncology.
The risk of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol used.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of intestinal cancer than women.
The exact cause of this kind of oncology cannot be determined by scientists, noting that certain factors result in a process that is harmful to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old
Many, or more precisely, all dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very smart.
But even they don't know how advanced four-legged pets are.
For many years, biologists have been experimenting to know for sure how the brains of animals are developed.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as wide as human, a new study proves that a dog can respond to 89 words or phrases in a consistent way.
The work of scientists was published in Sciencealtert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poems, know nothing about politics, economics, and art, but they're often fooling their masters.
Some species, the experts believe, show the best results in understanding human language, but statistics are not yet sufficient for accurate conclusions.
For example, some species are traditionally thought to be dog geniuses, such as labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are able to think logically, and their ability to learn is not less than a two - year - old.

In Ukraine, they're ready to trade in the United States and Russia.
The United States and Russia will be "trading" about Ukraine's entry into NATO, an Analyst Alexander Kochetkov stated in an article for the Glossaurus.
In his view, Washington and Moscow are about to continue negotiations on United States assurances that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden on the right of countries to “to go anywhere”.
If you're being offered something that is known to be unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you're not gonna trade, you're just gonna send a bidder.
And Ukraine is about to be traded," wrote an analyst.
Cochetkov added that Russia was not planning to attack Ukraine, but was seeking a dialogue with Kyiv.
“Preparation is done in a covert, quick and quick way to attack, rather than waiting for the faction to find out and deploy the forces of resistance,” he said.
China promotes the development of the rail transport industry
Advanced Chinese technology has attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France, and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Expo, held in Zhuzhou, Hongan Province/Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical failures, noted Hoo Zhaoven.
High-speed trains on the China-Laos rail line, which was put into service earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will make the rolling stock more secure and efficient.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased rail transport exports, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing “China's speed”.
In May of this year, CRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., the Ltd was the first two-story high-speed trains developed in China to export to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 km/h, these trains will be on the railroads of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, a pilot subway train developed by the company for Turkey began to be used.
The train will run along the line of the metropolitan link to the city airport in Istanbul.
The subway line will be open next year.
This will be the fastest subway line in Turkey at 120 km/h.
“The Chinese rail equipment industry is one of the highest level of innovation and the highest international innovation competitiveness,” said Feng Yaoxian, head of the China Trade and Investment Department of the China International Trade Promotion Committee/CEBMT/.
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of China's production of high-end equipment on the world market," Feng Yaosyan said.
After more than 60 years of hard work, after a number of independent research and development, China has set up an advanced system for the production of equipment for rail transport, with a full range of aids and large-scale production.
According to Feng Yaosyan, the country ranked first in the level of rail electrification and in the running of high-speed and urban rail.
Biologist listed the early signs of dementia
In an interview with Radio Sputnik, a bioscientific candidate named Simeon Holoshakin listed the early signs of dementia.
He said that the signs of future dementia could be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive irregularities, such as a failure to concentrate, to plan, and a decline in abstract thinking.
There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for it, says the specialist.
Holoshakin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurogeneative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis in the brain are the most common causes of this Syndrome.
Biologist noted that to date, the medical profession has no effective means of treating dementia.
It is therefore necessary to start prevention on time.
He said that the risk of dementia could be reduced by the study of foreign languages and active communication.
WHO also recommends that a moderate level of physical stress be maintained, and that cognitive skills be trained on a regular basis through games and hobbies, which require intensive memory and reasoning.
“There are recommendations for the application of the various BADs, but their effectiveness and utility are still under discussion in the scientific community”, said Holoshakin.
“The World Health Organization recommends the maintenance of a moderate level of physical stress, the regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive memory and reasoning,” said Holoshakin.
Previously, the British Dementia Foundation stated that the disease is affecting people over the age of 40.
The early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease have been cited by the meds.
The first warning sign is visual problems, which make it difficult for a patient to recognize objects.
Another sign of developing dementia was the aphasia, a state where a man cannot find the right words to convey what he is going to say.
The neurologist ordered Saakashvili to be sent for treatment abroad.
The former President of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili, was in need of psycho-operational treatment and rehabilitation abroad, and he told the press neurologist Otar Toidze, who was part of a medical consimilation set up under the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading cause of his illness.
The problems of movement, coordination, and perversity of character are persistent problems,” said the expert, noting that this was not beyond the norm and that the ex-president now needed to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psycho-zero-rehabilitation, which we didn't find possible in Georgia," said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical care after he was subject to disciplinary punishment by the prison service.
The Georgian policy has been quick to lift the penalty and to reinstate itself in the past.

Protests against COVID-passports in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, there have been protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate, which is sent to Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was about 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID has become mandatory for bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, old-age homes, and night-time entertainment.
A lot of protesters have come to the show without masks.
They blamed the State for totalitarianism with slogans on their poster and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be needed to enter entertainment and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city have declared a medical dictatoria, and the vaccine has been called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus have been detected since the start of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to impose restrictions on non-vaccinants.
The bill on the unified QR code system was introduced by the Government on 12 November.
It is expected that the Russians will be able to visit mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail facilities, with either a certificate of vaccination or a medical certificate for vaccination.
The same rules will be established for trains and aircraft.

A steep upturn: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people and help to build international resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will enable President Xi Jinping to gather one trillion yuan, but will also contribute to the economic development of the backward, remote provinces.
The Taiwu Mining resort in Zhangjiaku, not far from the winter Olympics, is becoming more popular in the Chinese.
In addition to building infrastructure in the region, greening is also being carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international competitions.
In many parts of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangjiakou, there are snow problems.
The main long-term challenge is to have a comfortable and interesting vacation in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
But it is far from there.
Justin Downs, a consultant for the game, said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese skiing industry has changed to unrecognized.
Every winter more Chinese go to the hills.
Fiona, a Snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many years to create a skiing culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to be actively developed and to develop the infrastructure needed for rest.
The 70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chungley, not far from the winter Olympics.
He noted that in recent years there had been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, from Beijing to Chungley, they ran a high-speed railroad, and now none of the locals suffers from work.
There are more and more shops in the country that sell clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes, there's a common grocery spot with the national dishes.
There's even a COVID 19 test station in Taiwan.
China is trying to create a flourishing winter sports industry, and its athletes must be the leaders of the major international competitions, and resorts and equipment must be at the global level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, reported at WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be put into extreme poverty because of the Coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed human progress in universal access to health care, has been declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
On 12 December, the International Day for Universal Health Coverage, WHO and WB issued two complementary reports.
They found that the pandemic had led to a failure in the provision of health care, and had created an overstretched health system.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has fallen, and the mortality rate from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
In WHO and the WB, the pandemic has led to “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it has become more difficult for people to pay for treatment.
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "to extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their pockets."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the Coronavirus Pandemie had swept more than 100 million people into poverty, and that more than four billion people had little social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese Minister was deactivated from the "Sammit for Democracy" at the request of the White House
The presentation by Taiwan's digital minister, Audrey Tan, at the panel discussion during the United States-sponsored "Sammit for Democracy" was translated into a video-free mode, attesting to the recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, with reference to the sources, states that the picture was disabled at the request of the White House.
The reason, according to them, was the map on which Taiwan was selected in a separate color from the PRC, which considered the island to be its territory.
The map, shown by Mrs. Tan, was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan was made green on it as “free,” and the PRC, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Laos and Vietnam as red as “closed”.
After the Minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the views of the discussants “do not necessarily express the position of the US Government”.
The PRC was not invited to the "Sammit for Democracy."
Reuters states that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister may have run counter to the one-China policy that Washington is pursuing.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was shown, the US National Security Council was angry with the State Department, blaming it for exposing Taiwan to a separate country.
Washington's “Sammit for Democracy” was held from 9 to 10 December with the participation of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and philanthropic organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
At the “zero day” of the summit, Nobel Peace Laureate, editor-in-chief of the New Newspaper, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, the Russian Federation's Under-Secretary of the Russian Federation, Yuri Averyanov, stated that the summit was an “anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge”.

The New Shepherd spaceship with six tourists on board made a suborbital flight.
The spaceship Blue Origin, with six tourists on board, made a suborbital flight on Saturday, 11 December.
The trip on the company's website lasted a total of more than 10 minutes, after which the passenger capsule went down to Earth, reports TASS.
The launcher was launched from a launch site in the U.S. city of Van Horn, Texas.
The ship rose to a height of just over 100 km, and space tourists found themselves in a state of impoverishment.
The launch vehicle itself landed on the launch site.
Blue Origin successfully carried out the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard with passengers on board on 20 July.

China is strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in land-locked cities
The Joint Mechanism for the Prevention and Control of the State Council of the PRC has issued a circular ordering the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in the cities where the land crossings are located, with a view to further preventing the import of infections from abroad.
According to the circular, people who leave the city are required to submit a negative test result for nucleic acids, COVID-19, which was obtained within 48 hours of departure.
Those who come to the city where the land pass is located must take at least one test for COVID-19 nucleic acids upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day when the relevant administrative units at the provincial level will identify and publish the areas of the towns in question, up to 15 March 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with land-based access points that meet certain conditions may consider the creation of buffer zones to prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

This item is the best combination of price and quality.
Balance is a modern material from the PSP.
The filler is hypoallergenic and secure.
That's why the foam is widely used in the industry.
Its safety and trustworthiness have been confirmed by a special certificate received in Europe, where such requirements are much stricter than those of Russia.
Another important quality of the Balance Foam is its orthopaedic character: the material supports the right position of the person throughout the sleep.
With the foam, the mattress has acquired a hardness below the mean level, so the product is considered to be relatively soft.
SuperSprings is the main transport unit in the mattress.
It's remarkable for the content of independent springs, and it's got 256 elements per square metre right here.

The MFA spoke of a “trustful conclusion” between Russia and the United States.
Sergey Ryabkov, Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in an interview with The News, assessed the prospects for the relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long way of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
There's one-sided negative predictability, but there's a lot of hope for a better relationship.
This is a sad conclusion from the long journey we have made with both the current administration and Trump and Obama.
The problem didn't start yesterday," said the diplomat.
According to Ryabkov, the problem lies in the US’s desire to impose on Russia approaches on a wide range of issues.
The MFA has added that it would not be risky to give an optimistic view of the prospects for better relations and would not expect a change in Washington ' s position.
He explained that, with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress was being made.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that the messages will be heard, and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Previously, the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, stated that Moscow was ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
The virus warns of the risk of inoculation of a nascent drug from COVID outside hospitals.
The invasive COVID-19 vaccines may be allergic and need medical help, so the first points to inoculate this drug should not be arranged at airports and shopping centres.
This was reported by TASS by a virologist, a RAN correspondent member, and by the Bionanotechnology, Microbiology and Virology Department of Novosibirs State University, Sergey Netes.
It's simpler to set up vaccination sites at airports and shopping centres, but I'd do it in the first place in health-care facilities alone.
The fact is, the risk of allergic reactions to such a vaccine is small, but it is desirable for a person to sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have ad hoc sets of anti-alergic drugs that work in just a minute or two, which can be very needed,” says Netes.
In the view of the virologist, it would be possible to think about vaccinations in shopping centres once there was experience in the use of the drug.
He also stressed that in using a solo vaccine, it was important for it to fall on the mucous casing in the nose.
In so doing, it is likely that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the infested nose is shrivelled after injection.

In the United Kingdom, 1,239 cases of omicron-stamp coronavirus-RT per day were recorded in Russian.
In the United Kingdom, 1,239 cases of infection with the new omicron-stamp coronavirus were detected 24 hours a day.
Sky News informs about this.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of "omicron" have been detected in England, 38 people have been infected with a new type of infection in Scotland, and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people with COVID-19 from the new strain in the United Kingdom was 3,137.
In a pessimistic prediction, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had previously estimated that 75,000 people in England could die by April due to a coronavirus outbreak.
Sandov warned of the suffering of Western countries imposing anti-Russia sanctions.
The Spokesman for the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russia sanctions in the event of continued “aggressive action” against Ukraine, including the alleged “instigation” into the country.
“It is not possible to impose any restrictions on Russia and not to suffer for itself,” the official representative of the Kremlin aired on Radio Russia 1.
Sandov claims it's "all the world understands."
In the past, it has been reported that the US is considering the introduction of anti-Russian energy sanctions as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to impose restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles to dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of the Sberbank, Herman Griff, is convinced that this is not possible.

New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of the participants refused to leave France.
On 12 December, the French channel BFM.TV reported this.
96.5 per cent of those who voted objected to independence.
In the South Pacific, 3.51 per cent of the population of the archipelago was independent of France.
The results of the 2.99 per cent ballots were cancelled.
The voting rate on that day was very low, with about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago coming to the sites.
In the view of the experts, the low level of attendance was due to calls by separatists to withdraw from the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was held in the region.
Most of the population supported the location of the archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is about 20,000 km from the mainland of France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia to be its property.
Some 270,000 people live on the archipelago, and the Territory has a special administrative-territorial status.
The 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration is in force, under which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice, with a difference of two years.

WHO presumes that "omicron" is less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily considers the “omicron” to be less dangerous than the delta-stam of the coronavirus.
There is, however, evidence of a decline in the effectiveness of vaccines in the new version of COVID-19.
As of 9 December, “omicron” was reported in 63 countries.
“Preliminary data and a significantly modified anti-gen profile of the “omicron” strain suggest a reduction in the effectiveness of the anti-infection vaccine and the transfer of the variant.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it may be less severe ("the severity of the disease" - ed.) than in the case of a "detta", states a WHO technical report.
The organization notes that so far all reported cases of “omicrone” infection in the EU are easy or unsymbol.
However, the new strain, according to the preliminary data, is spread faster than the delta.
There are two cases of omicron-stamp infection in Russia.
They were "previously immunized," told the Gamaley Center.
The head of Rostlyznadzor, Anna Popova, stated that there was still no reliable evidence that the new version of the coronavirus was less dangerous than the rest.

In Ukraine, four scripts for the
Ex-Deputy of the Supreme Rada, Vadim Denissenko, listed four variants of events for the President of Ukraine, Wladimir Zelenski, in 2022.
In his view, the head of State could be left without Western support, as well as perhaps compromise on Donbas.
On Sunday, 12 December, Denisenko spoke about it in a publication on the Glossary Portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called “the perfect storm,” suggests that Ukraine will stop supporting key Western countries by reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development would contribute to the deep crisis that Kyiv might face in 2023.
"The price of key goods that we have traditionally exported is on a par with a drop in the price of " ...> internal protests and opposition to key FPGs (financial-industry groups. - Red.) ", added an ex-parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of “war against everyone”.
This prediction will come true in the event of a high level of turbulence in global politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of challenges.
Because of this state of affairs, Ukraine’s leadership can make compromises on Donbass, which can lead to a domestic confrontation.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will be eroded, with a 50 to 55% chance, according to the former Nardep.
The third option in Ukraine's policy is to confront the dissenting groups of the Green and the President, which is likely to take control of the force bloc and implement “populist initiatives”.
In the course of such a crisis, Zelenski will start a “reform of power”, adding Denisenko.
Another scenario is to turn Zelensky into a "Father of the Nation."
This may result in an event that will be a major dislocation to society.
“The event must be large enough to trigger a response from external partners and lead to an increase in Ukraine's support,” said Denisenko.
The ex-deputee considers that such an option is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made catastrophe or an aggressive action by Russia.
On the other hand, the Russian side has on more than one occasion rejected any possibility of an “attack” on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the United States that have increased military activity at Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, a survey of the Sociological Group Raiting revealed that the ranking of the Ukrainian president had fallen to a record low of 19.3 per cent.
This is the lowest number since his election as Head of State.
Analysts foresaw a situation in which, in the event of the next election of the President of Ukraine for Zelenski, only 21.8 per cent of the vote would have been cast, while for the ex-President of the country, Peter Poroshenko, 14.5 per cent.
Of all those interviewed, only 19.3 per cent expressed support for the President.

The orthopaedic foam with coal insulation is made up on the surface of a scalp, which produces a micromassage effect.
Coconut coke is a hypoallergenic material that gives the mattress a high quality of water exchange and air-tightness.
The outer box for the mattress is made of a dense jaccard with synthetic fibers.
Material is strong and durable, is not obliterated, and is not subject to difficult care.
Arrested for an action in Red Square by a poet: "A quote from Eutouchenko for 10 days, this is the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, a 21-year-old poet, Alexander Volkenkov, was arrested for 10 days.
A student of the UCE was detained in Red Square with a poster on which a hashtag #poets of more poets was written.
This quote belongs to the author, Eugenius Eutoshenko.
A protocol on the administrative article on the re-violation of the public action was drawn up on Alexander.
For the first time, he was arrested on 23 January in Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The aim was to draw attention to poetry in general, and now, sadly, the interest in it has been lost, to the decline of a common culture in Russia, and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," Alexander explains.
We contacted a young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and to give more details to his message.
How have you been treated by the police this time and before?
What'd the department ask how you commented on your action?
This time, the staff was more accurate, the maximum, the most polite, as funny as it sounded in some context of the word.
At Pushkin, they took the OMONs and took them hard.
Asked standard about the motive.
When you heard, in principle, if you didn't like it, you'd get it.
With the exception of the four-way-sale of the monkey, it was all very right, but I knew what I was going to do.
And if, after the action under this hashtag, they start to write their own poems, at least a few people, I'm going to sit for a reason for 10 days.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak in private in the Tumba-yumba language.
And at public and official events, they speak the language of others so that everyone can see what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in the mother tongue through an interpreter.
It's protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel is very good at speaking Russian, but he's still using the help of an interpreter.
Also at official events, an old-fashioned transcript is performed by a pen, and a stenographer is not required to know more than one language.
You don't want to say a lot, so say no!

And then you're going to file for a divorce with America.
But that's not what keeps the Americans in the United States.
Keeps them convinced that in the US, it's better than anywhere.
That's how they grow.

Researchers described how potatoes help to cope with age disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients, which contribute to the improvement of blood flow and the reduction of cholesterol.
In root, there are vitamins B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, ribophlavin, folic acid, and pantotenic acid.
All of these elements help the system of the body to function.
Potatoes also help to combat age disorders.
Because of the high cell content, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use it can also help to prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
But for the best of all, root is better to put out or cook, not to bake on butter.
The Daily Express earlier warned that potatoes can be dangerous to diabetics, like other high-glyke products.
These are products with carbohydrates, which quickly split into sugar, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, Commersant had warned of a possible shortage of Russian canteen potatoes, noting a decline in production in private subsidiaries and an increase in processing capacity.
In the view of the market, the product deficit can only replace imports for the time being.
Lostfilm, longfilm and other pirates will be removed from the Yandex
Nominations for departure
In 2015, the rights holders from the RAAC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest web-running pirate sites, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kasarian, director of the Institute for Internet Research.
But some -- Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix -- still survived, including a regular change of domain name, he added.
For example, in the Lostfield, which is available in search of both the Yandex and Google, you can see pirate copies of Netflix's "Squid Game" and "Sweetness" by the director Anna Melician, the original show of Russia's largest video service, ivi (entered by AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available for the release of searchers, you can look at Encanto's animation novel, but based on the quality of the video, it's a so-called screen (a pirate copy of the movie in a movie theater).
"Filmix", which can also be found by means of search engines, is available on "Universe. 10 Years Later" by TNT (entered in Gazprom Media).

The light is a wall of Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
The wide circumference of the "molecules" of light provides as uniform and bright a light as possible.
"Atomic" or "molekular" design, which reflects the nature and nature of each subject, does not lose its relevance and makes it possible to place accents in the interior.
One of the traits of such lightlights is the impoverishment of design.
By means of thin, almost invisible wires, which are adjusted in heights, the chandelier has a sense of swelling in the air.

Dimax Matros Micro Ultimate, size 160x190
The orthopedic spring mattress of Micro Ultimate.
The model is handy by having two softly different surfaces, a high hardness and a little bit more than the average.
The product includes only quality and propellants, which have proved to be of the best value.
Springs: In the center of the model, an independent spring "micropacket" block has been set up.
This means that there are 2,000 spirals in the sleeping space, which work completely offline.
And it's their function that gives you a unique point-by-point fix.
Micropackage is the highest-frequent of all of the Dimax spring blocks, so it has a strong orthopaedic effect and is considered to be primal.
Fillers: A combination of the layers of the coary and natural latex is set up from the top and bottom of the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If there's a latex on one surface, there's a coconut coke on the other.
Such a tandum of fillings has long been a classical one, as it transmits not only orthopedic but also anatomical properties to the mattress.
If the coira provides the right back support, the latex gives the surface to be adapted to the human body.
Chekhol: The model is presented in the polygonal tricottal Aloe Vera.
At the request of the client, it can be either filmed or in-house.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, and the recommended load on the sleeping space is 170 kg.
Safeguards and security: the guarantee period is 3 years.
The mattress received all the necessary certificates and documents to prove its complete safety and security in operation.
The orthopaedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will look for life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to look for signs of life in the atmosphere, and reported on Sunday, “The Accuum”.
The purpose of the five-year start-up missions is to assess the fitness of Venus's clouds, and then to search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools to measure acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
So far, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the nearest planet to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist, but it is likely that Venus was an original Earth-type planet.
A sample from Venus is due for the third mission.
Let's say that if we find life there, the main question is whether it's Earth-like or different.
If so, it will be clear that life on earth has not begun.
And if it's different, it's probably more likely that life was born on Earth," said the head of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project, Michael Paisal.

Metal universes will change Russia's business
The theme of metavolents became popular in the fall of this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become Meta.
For the market, this was an important signal: the major player confirmed the development of a new format for digital interaction between people.
So, business in Russia, as in the world, will invest in the creation of its own metavolents and their subsequent monetization.
The metavolents should be viewed as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards the creation of remote interactions in the context of a pandemic, as people are tired of divisiveness and limitations.
On the other hand, it is the result of business ' s commitment to the development of ecosystems and to adapt operational models to them.
Third, they are a logical follow-up to the digitalization of assets, where any rights, securities, works of art, and even money are digitized.
Anya, you're right, a change in diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating the right way, you don't want anything too fat and bad.
Of course, we're going to have a holiday with a traditional olivier and a herring under my coat, but no one's gonna make me eat everything at once.
You can eat it on a spoon, try it on, and that's it.
After all, it's ten days off ahead, you can make any good and useful dishes.

And someone who didn't just do sports or can't imagine all the circles of hell she's been through, don't let it go.
The British economist was not able to make a 2022 prognosis.
The British economist Jim O'Neill was not able to make a 2022 prognosis, because in his view such an attempt would be a failure.
He wrote about this in an article for the Project Syndicate.
The expert is of the view that next year will be full of unpredictability, and any trend may change turn.
The most important factor is the Coronavirus Pandemic, and the second is inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he didn't know if the price hikes were temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of the endless generosity of the central banks has outlived itself” and it is time to return to a relationship where inflation-related interest rates will correlate with the expected rate of GDP growth.
O'Neill noted that, in the context of the pandemic, the continuation of super-soft economic policies may, in the view of some experts, lead to a new upsurge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be drawn to the issue of productivity growth, as well as to the rise in poverty and climate change, as summarized by O'Neill.
Mikhail Schulgin, the head of Global Research, Open Investment, had previously reported that positive expectations for the dollar for 2022 remained, with less growth potential.
One of the risks to the dollar’s value was the Fed’s monetary policy, the evolution of oil prices, and the fear of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is, when you compare yourself to yourself, five years ago, there were fewer containers.

The Russians donated about 4.5% of the country ' s GDP to autodealers
After 10 months of 2021, the Russians spent 2 trillion roubles to buy new cars, an increase of 28 per cent over the same period last year, as shown by the statistics of the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency.
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion roubles) was spent by the State to support the citizens and the economy during the Coronavirus Pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of country of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Wladimir Putin said that this amount was comparable to more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020.
The Korean brand of Kia is the leading market in Russia.
In the 10 months of this year, he was able to sell 325.7 billion roubles, an increase of almost 24% over the year before.
The Hyundai-affiliated Kia has an even larger growth rate of over 35%, and the profit from the car sale is estimated at 279.3 billion roubles.
In the leading position, this brand and in an increase in the weighted average car price - it rose by almost 21% in Hyundai over a year, to 1.94 million roubles - the most dynamic of travel was for Changan, Chery, Geely, and Mercedes-Benz.
The volume of sales in Korean brands has not increased so much: according to the statistics of the Auto-Producing Committee of the European Business Association in Russia, Kya has done 9.4 per cent more than a year earlier in the same period.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota is a three-man-dollar-solding company, which has been spent 275.5 billion roubles on this brand's cars in 10 months, an increase of 14% over the year before.
The Japanese follow the Mercedes-Benz with 266.1 billion roubles (+75 per cent) - the German bonus-brand has also increased sales (37 per cent) and the weighted average car price (almost 28 per cent up to 8.2 million roubles).
"Mercedes-Benz also has a good growth in sales and a weighted average price - more than BMW, for example - from this point on, and a larger increase in financial capacity," explained NAPI's CEO Tatiana Arabaji. -
At the rate of growth in sales, fantastic performance is shown by China's brands, which have also significantly increased the financial capacity this year.
The Russian Lada shows an average of 28% of the market, with 229.4 billion roubles spent on this mark in 10 months.
At last year's financial capacity, there are companies whose car sales fell in 2021: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Nissan.
The USS, in the minus, spent 12 billion roubles on SUVs and pickups in 10 months, as opposed to 12.4 billion roubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems in the supply of motor vehicles and the disruptions in production that have affected the world's motorway, the car company continues to make constant price adjustments - the same AutoVaz has raised the cost of the Lada model seven times a year, the last journey (by 8 to 10,000 roubles) took place at the end of November.
Prices are regularly rewrote for their products and other automotive manufacturers.
Russia’s car market will continue to grow in monetary terms, in addition to the shortage of cars, by means of inflation, as well as the drive to win back past losses, the experts believe.
With a shortage of cars, I think that a lot of car concerts have even been able to transfer some of the cost to the consumer of past periods, which they have not been able to place at the price of cars before,
Says BTB Capital Analyst on the Vladimir Bespalov motorway.
I think that, in financial terms, automotive producers are feeling very well right now, maintaining a high profit margin of sale."
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of motor vehicles, which has been on the rise in 2021, and the price of new machines has been rising faster than inflation, the expert explains.
In the long run, the market will grow in both quantitative and monetary terms, but mainly through inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, foretells Besfalls.
With the increase in supply, the potential for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, Russian authors will continue to grow next year, even if the cost of the car slows down, car manufacturers will be able to earn their income from the volume, notes the independent consultant on the Car Prom, Sergey Bourghaziev.
In view of the high demand and the lack of supply, car manufacturers are now seeking to make the highest profit from every car sold, notes the Burgasleys.
The growth in car production is not expected to take place in the next six months, and Russia is also heated by the uncertainty of future citizens.
Against the background of the market situation, motor vehicles have been a good place to invest - a car that was bought a year ago, even with a run, can now be sold more than the original cost, the expert notes.
Biden was talking about a US military transfer to Ukraine in the event of Russia's invasion.
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending the US military to Ukraine in the event of Russia's “execution. ”
President Joe Biden of the United States made this statement.
"Never had such a plan," the head of the White House said, in response to a journalist's question about whether the US had given up such an idea.
Byden noted that if the situation in Ukraine escalated, Russia would face economic consequences.
He stressed, however, that the United States and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine was not on the agenda.
Byden explained that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States would send forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and the Czech Republic).
"We will have to send more American and Nazi troops to the east flank, B9 -- all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Biden said.
Previously, the press secretary of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, stressed that Moscow has no intention of invading Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow saw the problem in the military use of Turkish-delivered drones by Kyiv, as well as in the fact that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.

If there's a phone call from such a number, like a "MVD employee" or other power structure, it's not going to be effective to drop it right away, and it's probably not going to be time to put it on a blacklist.

As for the drama "Fist-breaking" by Kiera Kovalenko (graduate of Alexander Sokurov's workshop), the film describes the complex relationship of a powerful father who wants to be freed from the paternal care of grown-up children in North Ossetia.
It was previously announced that the film was nominated for the Oscar Film Award as the best film ever made in a foreign language.
