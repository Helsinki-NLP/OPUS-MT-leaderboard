Republican Strategy to Resist Obama ' s Re-Election
The Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to combat falsification in the elections.
At Brennan Center, however, the latter is viewed as a myth, arguing that falsifications in the United States are more rare than the deaths from a lightning strike.
In addition, Republican jurists have counted only 300 electoral falsifications in the United States in 10 years.
One thing can be said with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on the turnout of voters.
In this sense, such actions are in part discrediting the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have enacted laws since 2009 that make it more difficult to register or vote.
This was a new development after the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to the Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills limiting voting rights in 41 states were passed in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require an elector to submit a photo identity card and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, abolish the right to register the elector on the day of the will, and remove the right to vote from citizens who have a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to submit an identity card with a picture.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated legislation to require voters to submit photo identity cards in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Québec, American citizens do not have as universal an identity card as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people who have reached the age to vote, do not have an identity card with a picture issued by their state government.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
The cost of obtaining the required identity card is often over $100.
New constraints disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age, and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo identity.
But that's not all.
Students who are considered to vote for Democrats are not allowed in several states to use a photo identity card issued by their educational institution.
At the same time, the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for the Republicans, to use the licenses issued by these clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of American citizenship to vote.
For the first time, such a request was made in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than 10 states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are US citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the voting of Latin Americans.
It is believed that two thirds of Latin American voters vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, the Republican legislature initiated laws in 2011 to abolish voter registration on the day of the vote in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wished to register.
This limit has not passed without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to put about 10 million citizens on the list.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17 per cent drop in the voter registration rate in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period of early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, although the latter represented only 13 per cent of the total number of voters in the state.
The same was true of Latin Americans.
In their representation of only 11 per cent of the electorate, they represented 24 per cent of the citizens who voted ahead.
In contrast to the whites, who make up 76 per cent of the voters, only 46 per cent of the voters voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws limiting voter registration.
A number of draft laws have been enacted by the Democratic Governors.
The most controversial laws have been suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney-General.
This has made it possible to limit the negative effects in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have enacted laws requiring photo identity.
However, the new rules that have come into effect will certainly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Democratic critics denounce the bias of laws that have been adopted, with a clear focus on influencing the 2012 elections in key states.
The report of the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that the states that passed the laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Bench to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with confidence that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout of voters.
In this sense, such actions are in part discrediting the system of American democracy.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Test or not?
In fact, the PSA test has sometimes misplaced results, false negative, and sometimes false positive results, leading to unhelpful medical intervention.
Men, who are so reluctant to go into dispensary, have much more to question.
Do you want to pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
In the United States, there have been many cases of infection among the study groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and it is difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time a European one, has found a difference in the mortality rate between those patients who have been screened and those who have not.
The study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the probability of metastasy is 30-40% higher for those who have not been screened.
So I'd recommend a test from the age of 50, or 40, if a direct relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin are also at high risk.
The key point is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and vintage.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his/her cancer by offering him/her options, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a risk to life in the long run, and by making a choice, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not receive treatment, as their cancer is neither aggressive nor life-threatening.
We're gonna offer them active surveillance, and if the disease progresses, we're gonna start the treatment.
More and more, we are setting out the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So I'd recommend that we go through the test after all.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to see if you need to take the test.
In co-operation with the International Association of Urology, Movember has developed a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.
The document (for the time being, the translation will be available shortly) can be downloaded at http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-head/prostate-cancer-screening
Avoid Sickness
Unfortunately, there is no miracle-recept to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, healthy lifestyles remain the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people were well fed and moved enough, 30 percent of the cancers could have been prevented.
"If no one ever smoked again, this number would have increased to at least 50%," stressed Andre Bole, Spokesman of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancers are due to hereditaryity.
Several types of cancer remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, tobacco control remains a priority despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is due to 85% of lung cancer.
And it's a risk factor for a lot of others.
It causes immense harm to human health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Québec," says Spokesman Andre Bole.
An encouraging fact is that 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is halved.
Weight
According to the CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Investigations show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," they add to the Association.
Power
The Association also recommends limiting the use of red meat.
In too many cases, it increases the risk of intestinal cancer.
Sausage should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salinity can result in carcinogens.
"The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," the Association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been researching the effect of vitamin supplements on cancer.
But for the time being, the results of these studies are not clear.
In the SCC ' s view, the results of the Vitamin E studies are contradictory.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other had the opposite effect.
There is also a lack of clarity in the assessment of the effect on the development of vitamin D.
However, he stressed that it was important to discuss his concerns and family history with the doctor.
"References don't lead to cancer."
Higgs Boson in Details
In the past summer, the report that scientists may have been able to locate Higgs' boson has caused real anxiety - and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all the particles in the universe, not much.
And it's also the last part, the existence of which was predicted in the Standard Model -- our best, or, in any case, "the least imperfect" description of the nature and behavior of matter -- but that was never found in the past.
But physicists don't really think it's Higgs' boson.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we're dealing with a real new particle, and that it's very much like the Higgs Boson, as the Standard Model predicted.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical convention in Kyoto seem to support this, although some data are not yet available for full confidence.
Let's still think of this as Higgs boson, because the chances of error seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law is absolutely inevitable, saying that two things can't end up in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to get past this rule, don't even try too hard, or you're gonna hurt yourself.
But while Particle Physics is a rather bizarre world, it turns out that it also has one such law: the principle of excluding Paulie, which posits that two particles cannot take the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" is, in general, in some of their characteristics.
On this basis, physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called ferrions, who wisely follow the principle of Paulie.
In the other, the bosons, an abominable gang of anarchists, who have no respect for anything - at least this principle, which means that they can find themselves in the same place at the same time.
According to the website (such as the most unusual) particle Adventure of Berkeley Labs, these bosons are in turn divided into two groups: the mesomons we're not talking about, and the "partikels of power" through which the main forces of nature are being spread, and which in some way include the Higgs Boson.
These very bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all as exotic as you might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronology, it's thanks to one incredibly trivial boson, a photon, or "part of the light," which is the "courier" of an electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a single particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it "breaks" an electromagnetic field in this particular place, about as a stone thrown into the pond.
From this “violation” is a electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photon, and therefore one of the “power carriers”.
A more stable field
The same thing happens with Higgs' boson, with the difference, that in order for this boson to come up, it's got to be "breaking" another field, the Higgs field.
But the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to energize it, you have to get very, very high energy, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could only shake a very big stone.
That's why we need a massive particle accelerator, like the one that's being used in CERN, the Great Adronic Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such immense energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful in explaining the relationship between Higgs' boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others don't: a piece of paper, for example, will never hold on to the fridge.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have a mass, while others (like photon, by the way) do not.
So, what "can bring" all this research, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to test the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to see the difference between observations and CM projections.
Also, some of them are eager to see such a discrepancy, because the slightest incompatibility can open the door to "new physics" and shut some of the Model holes.
The last one, I must say, still has significant shortcomings, without suggesting any explanation for the gravity (ah!) or for the dark matter that shapes about 80 percent of the universe (oh-oh!).
But so far, the CERN has not found such differences.
Effect
The use of these studies for the daily life of an average man is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
Look, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research at Bella's labs couldn't even imagine what revolution their work would cause.
They foresaw their applications in science, but nothing more.
In fact, the late physicist, Willard Boyle, who was working at Bell Labs, where a laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (previously impulsive) in 1962, said that the laser was initially viewed as a more "labular gadget."
Imagine...
And in addition, an app can be found for a tool to accompany the study.
For example, the same Willard Boyle, during his optic studies in 1969, developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, though not at all his original purpose, now serves as an eye for all digital cameras in the world and has won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Adron Collider will make a difference in our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative help is the best way to die...
The Commission for Decent Death in Québec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
Debates are about to resume, and a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
The Long tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monterezi.
Prostate cancer that hit him from the inside gave him a two-year stay.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed at Victor Gadbua's palliative care home in Beloy, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's always a shock, you can't get ready for it," he says.
The disease is doing its job: an unbelievable weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet on your own or even eating on your own.
As he sits at a table where he has a good meal, he gives up and agrees to be helped to eat.
He wakes up, even gets to smile, to talk to strangers who work around him, to bring him his meds, to take him to the bathtub.
Courage before a normal death.
"My greatest wish for me to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"For the rest of our lives, we're being taught that a man has to pee standing up," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the Victor Gadbua shelter.
Regression to the condition of the child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
"Everything depends on a man's ability to deal with the decline," he claims.
Since, in the midst of this decline, important events have occurred in the view of many people who take care of palliative care.
Patients who go to Victor Gadbua's palliative shelter all have cancer.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses is no longer providing care, called “Health care”.
Mrs. A., 89 years old, is the most afraid to die "in a state of suffocation."
But the disease let me know my kids.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything more in life," she says, before I let her put a mask that makes her breath easier.
She still awaits her son's last visit from Italy in the coming days.
At the Victor Gadbua shelter, a group of volunteers provide body care and food support.
This is a palliative care that stays when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québec, there is one place in palliative care for every 11 700 inhabitants.
That's not enough, given that we're all gonna die sooner or later.
This is where life goes on in the best possible environment, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors at the shelter.
Whether it's physical, emotional, or emotional.
We'll agree to give the dying man a mouth-strip of brandy or pepsi, whatever he asks.
Diabetes are no longer forced to control sugar levels.
And death is part of daily life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
His son finished this beer in the dead man's legs this morning.
"We help loved ones as well as patients," says Natalie Savar, the director of care.
Victor Gadbua's shelter doesn't look like the last day.
Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the courtyard, resting on his pillows during a toast to his name, a 36-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, dies tragically, and has tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months, between three and five beds, always occupied by cancer patients up to the age of 45," Dr. Christian Martel is concerned.
53 per cent of the patients admitted to the Victor Gadbua shelter come from home and 47 per cent from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is believed that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care, which is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, either at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor Gadbua shelter and the Greater Montreal House Palliative Care Society, are more or less specializing in the care of cancer patients.
It is this major gap in Québec ' s health system that has led many palliative care physicians to fear a law legitimizing euthanasia and suicidal care.
Beginning in October, a manifesto signed by the stewards in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapuant, has been circulating and demonstrating their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, the health system in Québec is not effective enough to ensure the right to palliative care of a high quality before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the E.R., in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to ease it.
I'm afraid the only reason the patients want to die is because they don't get proper care.
At the same time, many oncologists have been trying to save patients up to the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
Ellen Richard's hope for survival was already minimal when she stopped the debilitating chemo.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting the treatment, she told me that she was sorry to stop fighting, she said.
And she told me herself that my days are numbered!
There's no way out.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask for death thank the medical staff for not complying with their request after the palliative care team has eased their pain.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the fight against pain.
Elsie Monroe, the director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal House, said that the patients are not sensitive to pain in 8% of the cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to a palliative session in which the patient sleeps until he dies, either from time to time or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't know about this suffering any more.
Increasingly, patients who are unable to relieve the pain will be able to access a palliative session.
Patients with pain always say the same thing, "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want to get euthanasia," it means "I want to get better."
The creation of this report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Institute of Health Research of Canada.
Large-scale real property scandals in Québec
The officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, fund-raisers of political parties and Italian mafia professionals tell day after day what they know about the immense “system” of the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters.
“Industry”, which was very expensive to the tax-payers of Québec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's curious how this system disintegrates after all the means have been put into action, "is a joke to Jacques Duceno, a deputy and a former Chief of the Montreal Police."
It was through it that a scandal erupted in 2011 as a side effect of the investigation of official crimes related to road construction contracts in Québec, to which the then liberal Prime Minister, Jean Share, was very reluctant to agree.
The Duceno Report has established a direct link between industry, the secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"At the start of the investigation in 2010, he stresses, the Department of Transport alone would have kept a billion dollars on the contract" if some had held back their instincts to take a share.
The Charbonno Commission “has already removed the two mayors,” he adds, in the hope that it will be able to “discover the charts behind the individual”.
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, set up in 2011, has been involved in the case, including a large number of Government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the members of the special unit, Molott, who, after 2009, forced the Montréal Post Cartel to stop over-pricing the contracts.
In recent weeks, a series of searches have been carried out, and some municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcott, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
The next is Gilles Wyangkur, who recently resigned as mayor of Laval, the third-largest city in Québec.
He is suspected of receiving multiple bribes in ordering public order.
In addition, official charges have been brought against a number of operators of the Montréal Route Service and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurto and Lino Zambito.
The last one blew up a real bomb, talking about the "system" of getting government contracts.
For a number of years, Zambito had given 3% of the value of the contracts in Montreal to a Mafia broker who, in turn, was transferring the money of Mayor Gerald Trumblé's Party, United Montreal.
In the 2000s, Zambito soared with money to the right and to the left, and he transferred more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 Euros) to the various parties in the province, mostly the liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted that he was illegally raising funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Excess of value overvaluation contracts
The “system” of corruption in Montreal worked unrelentingly.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction companies, invitations to go to golf tournaments, to restaurants, to hockey matches, and bribes for a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewerage contracts, the value of which he overstated.
Other officials in charge of the construction of roads admitted to having been on their paws, overstretched by 30-40 per cent with false additions.
Then one of the mayor's party's organizers, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party's cash with dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Tramble resigned in early November, putting Montreal in a deep crisis.
Chantal Roulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal to be alarmed.
The mayor of Rivier de Prairie County, in the east of the island, has been opposing the sale of a five-million-dollar municipal property since 2010, resold to... 1.6 million developers in the middle of a building boom.
70% of the dirty money in the campaign
She says that in an investigation that will eventually be launched, she "will pull a string to understand the functioning of an ant-infested system to stop gangrene and identify the perpetrators."
This process is characterized as a pain but a positive one.
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and an observer to avoid the return of dubious practices.
How we clean up the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Duceno observes, for his part, that “workers have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,” but he is particularly concerned about the role of the “electoral officials who knew about the scheme” but who have not been involved in the scam.
Given the fact that the share of dirty money in funding the electoral campaign in Québec is 70%, he jokes, "I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Québec is proposing to limit to $100 a donation to the parties, but he said it wouldn't change the situation: "Until we limit the cost of electives, the politics will be dirty."
It requires a complete reform of the system of State contracting and party financing: “We can't go down down; with a bold glimpse of things, we can build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legitimacy.”
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Québec and Montréal, Mr. Duceno calls on those who laugh to look in their own courtyard ...
"SVU is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you've reached an extraordinary scale in the SVU.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be attributed to individual consciousness, but it can also be explained by a new dimension of SWAP.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
Technical staff have also made a lot of progress.
These factors make me go up the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's simpler.
It's all happening very fast in football.
But I'm not falling apart.
From the very beginning, I've always been moving forward at the IF pre-training center in clerfonthen, and until I got to St. Etienne.
So you're benefiting from the competition set up by Carlo Anchelotte...
It's not new to play a very high-level game in this summer.
They also know that every exercise is very important.
That's what makes a player like me want to be on the level and put up to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Anchelotte is supporting my position.
He's being helped by alternates like Claude Maciquelle, who played in the same position as I did.
Ancelotte is the owner of the position?
Of course.
Ancelotte is showing respect to all the technical staff.
He is one of Europe's top coaches in the First League today.
He has a lot of experience, and he has won a lot of titles with high-end clubs.
He was working with the big players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I left a whole series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my accomplishments.
What do you think of the first part of the SVU season?
In the First League, Leon took the lead from us.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have been effectively qualified in the 8th Finals.
What's the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, it can be.
We can say our word face-to-face with very good European teams.
First, we want to end up first in our band, in front of Porto, to be able to take back the match in the 8th final.
Will CSW be able to become a first-rate European club in the short run?
He's got a budget for this...
To become a big European club, Paris needs to win titles and fortify positions in the long run.
That's not true today.
Financially, SWD has the means to make this project real.
Not getting a title in the First League, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to get this championship title.
Last season, we were close to it.
In May, it was a disappointment, because we had everything to get to the end first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
Typically, 79 points are for the title of champ.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that such strong teams as Marcel, Lyon, and Bordeaux have come to fight for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media expect too much from SVU?
It's okay to expect a lot from us, given how much we've been invested and what kind of players we have.
We're all ready for this.
On the other hand, when we're at home winning 4-0 against Trua, and we're still found to be critical, of course, it's a bit frustrating.
We wonder what people want us to do first.
We can never win every weekend with a 4-0 bill.
We're not the Barcelona FC!
We're trying to implement a game project.
The command is formed over time.
We have shown in the League of Champions that we can meet modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who for two seasons has not been able to make it to the 8th Finals, even though they have also spent a lot of money!
With all the money we've got, we've got you 15 points ahead of us by the winter break.
That would be a disdain for our opponents and for the French championship.
Leon and Marcel, who weren't at the top last season, were "energized" by this new SVU.
This shows how entertaining the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The SCW seems to be entirely dependent on the feats of Zlatan Ibrahimovich.
So what if they say there's some sort of "Golden Dependence."
This only means that Irbrajik is very successful and that he has a lot of heads.
He's here for this and he proves he's the star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a big player and a world-wide star.
In the group, we respect him as a man and a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he's done is really exclusive.
This also encourages others to improve their game.
Tyago Silva, who is one of the world's best defenders, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive the Euro2012 with the French team?
How frustrating.
I was eager to be part of this Euro.
Sadly, my trauma has prevented me from wasting a bit of game time.
I saw a lot of things out there, and I got out more.
I've been able to play a good selection match today.
That's what I've been hoping for since I got baptized at the Blues.
We have learned from what has happened in Ukraine, and we must now be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Desham led by the Blues?
They're good for him.
He's got a good position in the selection group for the World Cup.
He's a strict coach, he's close to the players, and he inspires us to win.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc has achieved his goal, he has qualified us for the euro.
I hope Didier Desham brings the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved tie (1-1) torn out on 16 October in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone's been fighting for everyone.
Prior to this shock in Spain, my career has not had a match like this.

Full contrast to the current cash exchange, based on centrobanks numbered transactions between receiving parties with commission fees for processing.
In addition, as is often the case with these technologies, there is a clear political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, is causing financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonom), is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euro ...) and a secure protocol of the BitTorrent type, which allows for the exchange of files between members of the same level.
Some 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers online.
Several thousands of websites use bitcoins for donation or as a payment.
The rate of Bitcoin, which peaked at $30 (Euro23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to about $10 today (curses are available on Bitcoincharts.com).
It's nothing like a world-wide exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on virtual currency, published in October, was interested in the system.
He describes Bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with a dollar or a euro" and "like a normal currency."
Bitcoin differs from other types of Virtual Currency, as “credits” used to advance in a video game that is made in the game or can be bought (and sometimes traded).
The Facebook social network has also developed such a system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by a central authority.
In Bitcoin, all network nodes are both account holders, auditors, issuers of the currency, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between the two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
For each new payment, the user can select another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information relevant to this transaction is signed electronically using a dual-key encryption system.
The network can also check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the content of the file, it is possible to check that the bitcoins used in the transaction do exist in a public account distributed all over the network.
The key step is to record a new transaction in this book.
It's going through a math problem sent to a computer, which, like a temporary central bank, has the privilege of adding this new string.
This is the hashing phase of a file, which is to transform a big file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before "hash" all together.
The aim is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the start).
As soon as this number is found, other nodes can easily verify that it is right.
Transaction is thus insurmountablely linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deceit, the user would have wanted to pay the same money twice (in less than 10 minutes), only one of the two transactions would have been confirmed by the network - and the other would have been unsubstantiated, as they had different electronic signatures.
The computer that's doing the task is getting 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, the award is regularly shared in half, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of Bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one hundred million, leaving a reserve...
The difficulty of the task also grows with an increase in computing capacity.
The life of the network has already survived ups and downs.
The Bitcoin sites have been attacked, and Bitcoins have been stolen from the reserves.
"The defect used is not about the protocol itself," states Pierre Nuaz, who recently launched Paymium, a company that pays with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this shortcoming.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as WordPress blogs, are allowed to do so.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weitzman Institute in Israel, analyzing the account, found that almost 80 percent of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
The “Gigant Sales” was announced in November.
"Thirty-thousand dollars have been traded," lamented John Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts Bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of this currency, has a strong belief in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or an unconnected payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to test transactions, which is less expensive.
The owner has better control over his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
Just give an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Nuaza clarifies, making sure he has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to re-evaluate hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal ones.
"Before Bitcoin is established, it will take a while, but the year 2013 can be a turning point," he foretells.
The ECB's report, by the way, proposes to re-evaluate the range of risks that are now considered to be high if the system is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French forces left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapiza and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not just for us.
We have been the main victims of Afghan peasants, who we saw as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 dead soldiers, and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former commanders fleeing to Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case in the USSR.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
They are put up with, and sometimes help from local rebels, but they will no longer exist once the West has become more sensitive.
The departure of the French forces from the Nijrab base, which I was watching from the height of the hills planted with almonds thanks to French credit, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles, accompanied by helicopters, reached Kabul without attack.
There will be no Taliban attacks on Kabul since the end of 2014.
The situation has changed since their insurmountable progress from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the fighting between the various groups.
Taking control of the country at the time was viewed as a sort of release, a return to security.
Afghan women have been paid for the gloomyness of these peasants, who have been outnumbered by al-Qa`idah, but their situation has not improved today.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become businessmen who take over state land to resell it to returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, using massive United States sub-contracts.
They're discredited; most of them, by the way, didn't even fight themselves.
People, as I've heard in the countryside, want a government that is not a thief.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have succeeded in American generosity leave: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during the banishment in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; there are now 5 million people in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in urban areas are filled with both boys and girls.
Jobs must be provided to these young people, who will not want to return to the obscurity of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed militants, love mobile phones, TV, and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and are watching everywhere.
There's an army right now.
Will the authorities who will command it be considered to be legal?
The anti-Soviet commanders are already taking steps to re-establish provincial wives who would not be subject to the central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, must be to a certain extent decentralized, modelled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to transform it into a central State with strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister, which has existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the April 2014 elections.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even before, has been dependent on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on its feet, no dams are functioning, and no irrigation system has been renovated.
All are imported; nothing but vegetables and fruit is produced.
Priority is given to a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by the war of 30 years, State control of the infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan possesses immense mineral wealth.
This has only increased the sense that Western countries were there to take over.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper on the ground, without means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already left the Mes Ainak Copper Field, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a vast Buddhism complex and to remain the province’s largest employer.
There is also a need for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which import and export depend to a large extent, to re-establish normal relations one day.
The withdrawal of the French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provided for the preservation of traditional assistance: girls ' faces, boys, the French language department at the University, the French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, and the support of an archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to “invade hearts and minds” and to meet the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the “war-civilian activity” service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French social organization, has contributed to a large number of community work and activities aimed at re-establishing agriculture in dozens of mountainous villages.
These efforts, with intensive local labour, have helped to contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, potable water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection, and an increase in arable land.
What will we leave to remember ourselves by spending two billion Euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at a height of over 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in Kapisa Province.
To get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, which the farmers wanted, as they told me, we need to give them a small non-military support that is well-managed and direct to them.
Difficult birth of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky move by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt was more divided than ever, on the question of a constitutional declaration, which gave it temporary emergency powers, it decided to play a waffle.
On a surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave the Assembly two extra months to complete the work.
For two years now, Egypt has been basing itself on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only reinforced the country ' s division.
In the view of his opponents, the President persists in his "automatic madness" by continuing to "break the word" and "puzzle the right."
In the camp, his followers are convinced that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by speeding up the transition process.
The referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, article after article.
For the President, it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent is raging all over the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview to American weekly Time.
The call for a fast-track vote is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Or you vote for my text, or I leave myself with extraordinary powers," which is expected to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constitutive Assembly, most of them Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to deliver their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order to reach the necessary Quorum, 11 persons, the spares, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
It is not surprising that, in most cases, the articles have been voted in unanimity.
The commentators, by the way, have been amazed by the fact that one of the few differences of the day was about... the time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the hours of the Congregation had been misconfigured.
The text on which the vote was still held yesterday is composed of 234 articles.
The subject of universal attention, article 2 was ultimately the same as the article in the 1971 Constitution, which states that “the sharia is the main source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for which the application of Islamic law was a fundamental requirement, had hoped to replace “principles” with “rules”, which would have made it possible to apply them more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a sign of their good will and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Physicism," answer the liberals, who see it as just a PR.
Because, in their view, Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of the observance of sharia law.
According to an expert in Egypt, this is a worrisome fact, since “the people who are called upon to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can watch the birth of theocracy."
Many liberals are also encouraged by the fact that the next president of this university is likely to be much less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment, there is no specific religious intervention.
With this constitution, we remain under civil law.
Most of the jurists who worked on this text are not ulema, but people with a university degree, some have been studying in the French system" - comforts Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that “under article 220 there may be ambiguities, as the terms used in it are taken from religious language.
This applies in particular to the “figs” [islamic jurisprudence, ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to how competent the civil judges are to rule on it.
In addition to its religious dimension, the text adopted yesterday is subject to criticism, as it gives wide powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have been significantly lower than in the old regime.
The other point is the authority of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defence budget will be reviewed by the National Defence Council, not by Parliament.
Nor would the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they considered to be detrimental to freedom.
Blasphemy has been held responsible, and insults are now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for the freedom of expression, and especially for the freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles speaks more of the protection of a woman, as Heba Moraef, from Human Rights Watch, points out.
According to her, the only positive point was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that didn't appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was to be on TV last night, the demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
Proponents of the Head of State, in turn, will go to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Pup of Earth, and the sea from the skies.
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of Bible truths, the modern - day comfort, and the predestination of nature.
AIF has identified five of the most important reasons to go to Israel.
Let us bow down to the holy places
We should go to the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that everyone who enters this "buyer" enjoys God's grace.
And Galilee is the place of Jesus ’ miracles: to turn water at a wedding into wine, to walk in the water, to calm the storm, and to fill the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy things in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here follow the Path of Troubles or the Godly Path of Jesus (in Latin, Via Doloros).
It begins at the fortress of Antony-Pretorium, where there was a court of law, and brings to the Temple of the Lord at Mount Golgotha, to the place of crucifixion, the Stone of Anointment, and the place of Jesus ’ burial.
Here, too, is the figurative Christian pope of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be erected in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree has grown from which a cross has been made for Jesus ’ crucifixion.
There is also the most holy place in Jerusalem for the Jews, the Wall of Cry, left from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
It's the custom for people of different confessions to leave a note here with a wish, which is then fulfilled.
Make a straight-up trip
The ruins of the fortress of Massada were left from the secret refuge from the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on high rocks in the mountains at a height of 450 m above the sea level.
And only those who are preying on climbing can get to it.
The rest of this historic peak is brought by a lift on a wire road.
And in the north of the country, at a height of 1600-2040 meters, there is the famous Hermon Mining resort, where in winter months there is a massive influx of tourists.
He's got a shuttle bus at the bottom of the mountain.
The total length of the ski tracks is 45 km.
Old tradition is that pagan gods were supposed to be at the top of the mountain.
Visits to Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You don't go to everyone for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth a visit.
These include the Israeli Museum, which is not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Qumran Manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Jewish Desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
You should go to the Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv.
His displays include the paintings of impressionists and expressionists Mone, Pissarro, Renuare, Cezanne, Seasley, Mattissa, Modilani, Chagalla, Picasso.
You can go to the Al-Bash Museum in Akko, which is a few halls of an old Turkish bath with a mix of visitors and banners at the time.
In Cesarea, you should go to the unique private Rally Museum, where you can enjoy the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There's no field guides or souvenir shops.
The entry is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad-Wash in Tel-Aviv, is one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the Children ' s Memory, was built in memory of the 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas cells.
You go into it, you end up in absolute darkness.
The stars are blinking.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died are sounded.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Get well.
The three main Israeli resorts are on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has pools, water parks, dolphins, and oceaniums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is bathed even in winter months, since the water is not below 21 degrees of warmth and the air is warmed up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is warmer, and it is bathed all year.
By the way, this is the most unusual sea in the world at the lowest point on the planet, 417 m below the sea level.
The azure water in it is dissolute, easy to keep on afloat even if they can't swim at all.
Landscapes are incredibly beautiful.
They come here to receive a course of treatment with salty water - sprouts, and medicinal dirt, and to treat health with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar diabetic to fix the shaken nerves.
Touch the Secrets of the Old
They are kept by the ancient part of Tel-Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the shores of the Mediterranean.
Through it was the famous seaway, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, this is where Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists are very fond of wandering down the narrow streets named after the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "my" sign, the Fortune will be favorable.
In Jaffa, you can find newlyweds from all over Israel and even from other countries in a photo shoot.
And in Cesarea, the city of King Herod, you can wander around the Roman theatre, "swap" the fortress of the crusaders.
In the Roman period, Cesarea was the main city of Judah and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
A carefully renovated theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
A Visitor for Note
Going to Israel, don't worry about your imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the population in the country speaks Russian.
It is best to borrow money for a trip in dollars, not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to trade for shekels (now US$ 1-3.8).
City transport is mostly bus, but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram, and Haifa is the country's only subway line, consisting of six stations, linking the Lower City to the Upper.
In fact, it's an underground funikler.
Travel in all modes of urban transport is worth 6 shekels, for which you can travel with transplants for a period of 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Sabbath is the Sabbath Sabbath.
From Friday evening to sundown on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport are shut down.
And on Sunday morning, the week of work begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes, which combine milk with meat.
It offers a wide selection of lambs and beef, soups, and desserts made on coconut milk, the traditional Jewish pasta hummus, a variety of sauces, a hammered nut - phalal, fruit, and vegetables.
There are no wandering dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there's a lot of fed cats who go on their own.
Even on the rooftops of parked cars, you can see them sleeping in the evening.
Murleys love people's places and don't give up their treats.
The rental of a car, depending on the stamp, will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 a day.
And it's going to cost 15 nicks a day to rent a bike.
Museum tickets are on average 30 shekels.
Numbers in language
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
The most traveling and resting citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine have come.
From January to October 2012, 118,800 Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, an increase of 51 per cent over the 2010 figure, prior to the cancellation of the visas on 9 February 2011.
"Great and Powerful" to Moscow will prove that migrants save money in the language.
As long as deputies and human rights defenders are arguing about giving the law on compulsory language testing, there are already crooks in the country who sell “leave” certificates.
Every year, 13 million gastrobytes come to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to make money to support the families left behind.
As from 1 December, a law has been in force requiring every migrant to take the Russian language proficiency examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the areas of services, public housing, welfare and retail trade.
In time, however, the FMS promises, the test will become mandatory for all the visitors.
But not just the language, but also the Russian history, and the basics of the law, will have to be handed over.
The language will have to be confirmed for both the receipt and the extension of the work permit.
The exception applies only to nationals of countries where Russian is the national language.
Nor do people who have been able to obtain a certificate and a certificate of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, doomsdays and the protection of rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the MGU, the SBGU and other Russian universities.
In all cities, migrants will be able to pass the tests; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
Both the State Duma and the FMS supported the initiative to introduce testing.
But human rights defenders, before the law came into force, had many times been able to ask the press, "What will this actually do?"
What will change the obligation to learn the language for both the Russians and the visitors themselves?
First of all, the Migration Service responds, which will reduce the number of people suffering from “labour slavery”.
A lot of people are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explaining the head of the Russian Federation office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only a system of organized recruitment will 90% solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, an education that is unfamiliar with a language without a medical certificate.
Without an understanding of the language, I'm sure to say to myself, a future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who, under the guise of help, put a "way" in a horrendous, narrow hut, where he and dozens of his kind will spend months with no food and no documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We're getting a lot of complaints from our migrants.
“At home, they are promised one thing, and upon their arrival they are defrauded, their passports are taken, and they do not pay the promised wage,” confirms the head of the General Directorate of Labour Migration of MS Tolib Šaripov.
Don't swear, sucker!
However, as long as many citizens of the Central Asian republics are going to work in Russia, it has been recognized that not only do not know the language of the country to which they want to go, but it is hard to write on their own.
Of course, it is not so much their fault, but their misfortune: few Turks, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even meaningful primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to feed their children, not to mention proper dressing, dressing, and dressing up for school.
As they grow up to be adolescence, they go to work as soon as possible.
It is hard, if they are ignorant of the language, to admit it.
"You're feeling humiliated and incompetent."
True, with regard to the language law, human rights defenders note one important point.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or further formal work.
In the meantime, most of the gastrobyters still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or no extraneous entry."
Many of the visitors claim that it is not easy to get an official status in our country.
The reason is that there are bureaucracy and still the same language difficulties.
Also, legalization is worth 12 to 16,000 roubles.
But a fake registration can be done fast and for just a thousand.
The officers of the Russian police know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, and so are the cases of extortion.
"Paid a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," he shared with the journalists a national of Tajikistan, Umed Huskadamov.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy art."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was found that it was not just migrant registration documents that were falsified.
A number of “lower” language test certificates have already been withdrawn by FMS staff.
Forged papers are printed on a normal color printer.
Of course, the new owners didn't get it for nothing: each of the migrants who hoped to make it easier to pass the test paid 7,000 roubles for the document.
This is more than double the cost of a formal test: it will cost a migrant worker three thousand.
The main task in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that “cratches” cannot be just bought, and the authorities and human rights defenders are all in common.
For the time being, the authorities can promise to the hostbytes, who have not been able to pass the test on the first time, the time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know the Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not trade in the illegal arms market
The proportion of legal-armed crime is very low
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia is proposing to tighten the law on the owner of civilian weapons.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: to push shots at weddings when no casualties occurred, and to the massacre by the Moscow jurist Dmitri Vinogradov, which led to the death of seven people.
The police want to prohibit the carrying of injuries in public places and to raise the age from which a license for arms can be obtained, from 18 to 21.
Irina Yarovaya, head of the Domesian Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, supported the idea and promised that the arms law would be amended by the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "rolling the haze."
There was an open letter on the network, which, from various public small-scale organizations, called for a “unnotic hardening” to be lifted.
The percentage of hooliganism with a registered weapon is minimal, and the Russian BBC's attorney, Vasily Lesnikov, has stated.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the six months of 2012, there have been 142 offences with the use of firearms registered with the internal affairs agencies, while in the same period there have been 1,168,000 offences.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of the law on civilian weapons does not place the offender on the black market.
Now, according to them, any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low cost.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Internal Affairs has claimed to be in control of the situation with regard to the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Vendors: from factories to officers
The black market for arms is being expanded through a number of channels.
The main channels are five, says a retired colonel, Victor Baranets, who has been in the Ministry of Education and General Staff for 10 years.
Screenshot of an arms-ordered site
The first is an "armey or military trail", a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves dragged the guns," says Baranets.
The next kind of black gun is stolen by criminals from the security forces.
The Barane explains that this includes both those taken from the police depots and those stolen directly from law enforcement officers.
Illegal "stools" are on the market from military warehouses.
There have been frequent explosions in many military depots.
"There is a well-proved theory that part of the arson was made on purpose - to cover up the shortfall," the ex-military said.
According to Baranz, arms manufacturers have contributed.
“Private arms plants are now in the process of being produced, which are not competitive on the international market and are putting weapons from the floors to the black market, including Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
The number of guns and guns from poor countries, such as Kirgistan, is particularly high.
"There is production, sometimes handicrafts, and there's a mafia that's set up the stream," ex-military.
Where's the gun from?
The experts estimated the estimated share of each source of illegal arms to the black market.
A report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Design.
The experts analysed the records of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, the criminology literature and the public data of the arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons are written by researchers, come from the army and the security agencies.
The report states that half of all black-market weapons have been found there “in the hands of officials whose work is related to arms”.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the cases of weapons come from the scene of armed conflict, 14 per cent of the cases of theft at the time of the production of weapons, and 5 per cent of the cases are “black archaeology”.
The salesman of one of the arms shops, who asks you not to name his name, assures you that the weapons found by the black miners have been out of business for a long time, too old.
Most of the time, he says, the sellers are on their way to the military warehouse.
By means of a flagger, a man buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
He's being discharged, passed over the fence.
"He's moving her to the city and here he sells 900 Euros a grand with two shops," he says.
"Truly, the police are aware of all the cases, so from time to time, when a plan to solve crimes is on fire, they make a check-up purchase from illegal arms dealers," the consultant adds.
"As in a luxurious shop."
The seller and the buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at the Web sites, blogs, until a friend responded, who offered to come to the Bogoway platform, where there's gonna be a man who's gonna take me to the corner where we're gonna trade.
The price of the gun was only there.
Military columnist Victor Baranets
To get a gun, I need a friend who has a way out, says a consulting vendor.
Salesmen are on the market, but you have to go there as well, conditionally, "of Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell her that the daughter's tooth fell out."
I'm getting a couple of castes right now through a man I'm sure of.
He only delivers it to me, too, because he knows I'm not gonna give it up.
Newcomers look for weapons in a number of ways.
Former military Victor Baranets tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid 1990s when he was writing an article on it.
The charts, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with a picture of "whatever."
"I felt like a luxurious shop," the military remembers.
The buyer, according to Baranz, is not being offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I, a potential client, don't just buy - we're going with a salesman to the woods, and we're setting a target.
"I'm given the opportunity to fire, and when I find out that a gun hits well, we start to trade," the expert describes the procedure.
Lounge on the sofa
Internet searchers are uploaded to Web sites and groups in Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons for "a variety of purposes."
You don't need any documents or private meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain sum of money," writes in an ad on the Web site, "Buy a gun or a gun."
Users leave their applications and ask questions.
Are you gonna sell to a minor?
"No license, of course," asks the user Ivan (orphography retained).
"Couple of TT.Moscow" is a cunningly voicing the request for "Fedorencs."
The Federal Security Service has now unloaded a massive network of front-sites that want to buy combat weapons with a shovel.
People go like a hungry fish for food, and then they get coal in Siberia.
Military Spectator and former Military Victor Baranets
I've heard of such schemes: the site is usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The purchaser pays through the ATM.
"In response, they send a picture and an instruction where the gun is hidden," says Dmitri Kislov, a press reporter of the Public Organisation Right to Arms.
Victor Baranets claims that by keeping the application on the Web site, you can go without a gun and go to jail.
The Federal Security Service has now unloaded a massive network of front-sites that want to buy combat weapons with a shovel.
"People go like a hungry fish to feed, and then get coal to Siberia," he claims.
100-dollar macara
For the purchase of illegal small arms, experts estimate that the sum can be between $100 and $900.
According to Dimitri Kislov of Right to Arms, Makarov's gun can be purchased for $100-300.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from the warehouses of the long-term storage by the management of these medium-level warehouses.
In the official state of the agency, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole fell by 7 per cent from January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of reported cases of theft and extortion of arms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices fell by 7.8 per cent.
Fastfood and supermarket workers are on strike in the United States
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers work at McDonald's.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protest against low wages in Walmart and restaurants of popular fast-food nets, such as McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy, and Kentucky Free Chicken.
So far, no one is going to predict whether this wave is going to turn into the ninth shaft, or whether it's going to exhale in the early stages.
Actions support trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to the modest wage increases for regular Walmart workers and the fast-food system, the object of the protesters is to set up trade union organizations in them.
So far, this sector of the economy has not been covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The stock began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, when America was hit by an orgy of low-priced sales, which seized millions of users and was sometimes accompanied by fights.
On this day, some Walmart company employees, who employ 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and picketed with trade unions and left-handed businessmen, whose product is counted on people of low- and medium-size wealth.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from diapers, hunting rifles, and car batteries, to vacuumers, eggs, and milk.
Products in his shops are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than in major supermarkets.
So a lot of low-paying Walmart employees only get to work.
Accessibility and range of products have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods in part because he pays less to his employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of trucks or hand-held scanners.
The Black Friday stockers called for an increase in the wage and lamented that the cost of the company's health insurance had swelled from $30 to $100 a month.
Typical Walmart worker getting $9.5 an hour, it's a waste, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost a corporation of $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1 per cent more than she spends on her salary right now.
If Walmart puts the pay-as-you-go on the back of the buyers, every shopping visit will cost them just 46 cents more.
In a year, they'll spend some $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart’s supporters have rather remarked that the protest took place in only nine states and did not cause any harm to the corporation.
"Black Friday" continued at her shops from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cashiers made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview with Huffington Post's left the job for a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was just "one-time pyar trick" of the trade union that organized her.
"Free cashier!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not targeted by Walmart (they are not lamented in this progressive city, so they are not here yet), but by the McDonalds and other low-priced restaurants.
McDonalds says he sells billions of servings, and after that, he won't even give you sick and pays you for an honest job!
Djumain Williams, Councilman of New York
At the moment, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Restaurants of fast diets will increase over time, but not much, and on average, their regulars get $8.90 an hour in New York City.
No one earns less in this dear city.
How can you live in New York for that kind of money, it's incomprehensible to me.
The McDonalds used to run almost a quarter of American teenagers who used to work behind their counters after school while living with their parents.
Not many people saw it as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I'm always running into interviews with McDonald's employees, who are complaining that they should live on this wage and sometimes even feed the kids on it.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum has a comment, the author of which observes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you're going to do to feed them.
The protesters, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of the fast-food system start paying at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade-union organizations be set up in the area of fast-food.
The American Act prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing trade unionists with bullies and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is also difficult for a trade union to reach a fast diet for objective reasons.
One of the main things is the extraordinary turnover of human beings.
Disagree
There were noisy protests this day and at a number of other low-priced Manhattan restaurants.
The event culminated in a midday rally at McDonald's next to Times Square, where a number of local democratic politicians, such as Councilman Jumaine Williams, said, "Macdonalds" says he sells billions of servings, and then he won't even give you sick and pays you for an honest job!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New Yorkers, such as Bill de Blacio, a candidate for mayor of the city, who said that "we must stand by the fast-food workers so that they can get the fair pay and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American realm of fast-food.
But there were just a few hundred people in it, and not all of them were fast-foodrs, with tens of thousands of people in New York.
So far, it is not clear whether this spark will produce the flames of mass motion.
"As long as the brain is fooled, it's medium."
The popular theme of modern technology has been the subject of a new reality in recent times, mainly through the prism of special points.
The current model was first shown by Google at its annual conference in the summer, and later in November it was reported that Microsoft had also applied for a patent.
However, it is clear from a conversation with the head of the 3D-Technology Group at the Cambridge Microsoft Laboratories, Sharam Izadi, that for the company's scientists, the glasses are the stage.
They are enticed by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Can you tell me in a general way what your research team is doing?
- We're working on a man's interaction with machines, but we're trying to expand the boundaries of this interplay.
As long as humanity is in the masses at the point of pixels on a flat screen, it's sometimes with a finger.
We want to look ahead for five to ten years and anticipate fundamental changes in this relationship.
For example, the Xbox device and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost none of the Xbox today is for sale without Kinect, because everyone is interested in sign control.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Even though Kinect has moved the interaction to a physical level, a lot still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of the information has improved (the system has more data), and the output is not very good yet.
We're trying to change this, we're working on real three-dimensional display systems based on a variety of technologies, including design.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, make it more imaginable.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not just the user, but also the space around it.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid virtual real-world helmets!
- What do you think about the voice control?
It's a popular thing, but don't they overestimate it?
- It's definitely not a panacea - it's a matter of privacy, because you don't always want to tell people about your actions and intentions.
In fact, all sorts of interactions with computers are good, but everyone's in their own pockets.
For example, we had a project to run the devices in public places where we thought about the gestures, not the fuzzy ones, but the stingy, short ones.
The sign was not taken by the camera of the device, but by a handcuffed armband, which recorded the movement of the bones and the muscles.
So far, it's big, but in theory, it can be reduced to the size of a handcuff.
But in general, the future of a blended type of control, like a sign-and-voice.
- What do you mean?
- Like how do you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You'll say it, and you'll show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- So you're trying to get users to adapt to what a car can or can't at the moment?
- You don't have to, but it's a rapprochement.
I think we're going to have to work on developing new types of sensors in the near future that will enable us to better measure human reactions.
It can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it's very important.
- Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your concerns about modern cameras?
Missing permission, depth or something?
- In principle, this generation is something that can be repulsed in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get mega-pixel eight at a rate of 1000 k/s.
But it's not the mega-pixels themselves, it's the matrices and the depths.
From the last point of view, all the current technology is not good enough for us to add work to the designers of algorithms.
So you have to remember not just the X-and-Y resolution, but the Z resolution.
Also very important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are relatively dynamic, and the current 30 k/s are not very strong, especially for sign-time.
Stephen Betishes from our Redmond lab made a touch sensor with a controlled delay of between 1 and 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) point.
Not everyone understands the effect that this has on the interaction of humans and machines.
I could really use the equivalent of a device like this in my work, but I don't need to touch it so I can have more frames per second.
- Don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "cams," one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other is the receiver of the signal reflected.
And this is the third camera, which is actually the normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or worsen it by increasing the volume of calculations required.
It would be good to create a flexible analogy to Kinect, to play with the curvature of the cameras, and to see how this would help in the three-dimensional positioning.
- As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present her glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from the point of view of the daily use of the augmented-reality technology, the glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, it's not very convenient to keep a smartphone up in your arms all the time, but I think the coolest option would be a "transit"-additional reality, when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display, and so on.
Brilliants are a very personal device, in which their strength is (the private things you see) and at the same time, the weakness is an added reality based on the glasses, which will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's just say for a moment, it's not just Tony Stark of Iron Man's, but it's just a mortal man who can manipulate virtual holographic objects in the air.
There is one problem that is often pointed out by critics of such an idea: there is no tactful renunciation!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your group's answers to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is the seventh biggest breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think it's a good idea to be the eighth one to add to the tactful sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a substrate for the image.
She's got a good record of the push!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on giving these "carts in the air" a touch -- for example, the interference of a few focused ultrasonic rays at a point where the finger is located, gives you a sense, but so far it's very weak -- as if you've been tipped off on your pillows.
There are bracelets on the wrists that have an effect on the nerve end in the fingers, which is also a promising direction.
- Did you try to trick the brain?
Make him think he's feeling what he's supposed to feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
And there's another problem that we have to face for a long time -- how to get a man in a very restricted space to believe that he's going on open, almost endless -- working on the concepts of runaways (not as in clubs), moving platforms, as well as big balls.
As long as brain deceit is medium, the job is still very long.
That's what makes the work on virtual reality so appealing to a researcher - a lot of things in a very infancy state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt is continuing the “Petersburg Vanguard” project on the citizens who are in the front, in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top-list has already been hit by the bright art scenes of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often being recognized in Europe, over and above all Russian renown.
The new character of "Rosbalt" is an erotic artist, Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man, dressed in all red, who is found at the Russian Museum, then in the Summer Garden, then in fashion parties, and vernisces.
The paintings of Kirill Miller always gather a crowd of viewers wherever they stand.
Kirill Miller is one of the very peterburg socio-philosophic fairytales who created new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the Peterburg vanguard of the late '80s - the early '90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, with his appearance on the streets as a smile to the city, cheering everyone up.
He recently took the scarlet in his hand and became a peterburg charlet, as he was ripe for this complex role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy, and image.
Kirill, why are you still walking around the city in all red, not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I've chosen red as a designer with a view and an image.
In this world, red is a trade-off between an artist, an imager, and a society.
Although, in society, everything that's a little bit grey is arousing aggression and arousing a bad character.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to a discussion.
- When did you know you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition in Nevsky D.C., where my work was displayed.
I knew this was my way.
Then a wave of old free, informal artists went off, and new, free kind of me was incomprehensible.
I began to be friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-hazone that led to the Pushkin 10, and there was no more.
I get thrown into the theatre, my clothes, my music, all my genres, except a word.
- And all of this has come together in your Art-Clinic... - it was important for me to find myself in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied the Territory on the Pushkin 10, and there, until it was renovated, there was a music club, a bohemian club, a home of a peterburg boheme.
A lot of them were born: NOMs, Tequila Jazz, I remember the Schnur was brought with the Van Gogh ear project.
The cord and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, they were in a tight thong, among them was the fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was the head of many of the programs before the Cali-Galiban era.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went on, and he got basic education and education from us.
The D-137 Gallery, the Griboeda Club, is a resonance from the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and the regulars left.
I'm the hero of the last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was "The People of Our City."
In the "Artist of the Year" nomination, I was named, and my climax was over.
In new times it's not easy to work by the old rules, I'm a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the last century.
It's easy to become popular in our age, but culture and popularity are split up, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is in the way you know it.
- A lot of my paintings are hits, they have a strong sense of relevance and aggravity.
I'm gonna have a program show, "Russ Clown Museum."
Clowns are an extracurricular category.
I used to be a socialist, now being like this-- it's pain and fear.
But it's all smearing in clowns, it's a tragedy.
I love the Grotesk, I have the grande ideas.
For example, saving the world by totalitarian dressing in order.
Now they're meeting on their clothes, focusing on the outside mechanic, not on the inside man.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and spit in the face.
And the deceit will be removed by dressing.
And we've just seen you as a city masturbator.
Who better than me to be.
- Well, maybe business art can be pretty?
- Now, commercial art has to be tidy, polite, sweet.
Cultures are disintegrated.
Back in the day, people fell into a pack, the bohemian loved one, the other.
Now everyone's been crushed into a micro-community, and now it's hard for everyone to like.
I'm not a hundred-dollar piece of paper for everyone to like.
Now we need to think who likes it.
Now, every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And at Stasa Mikhaylov a few thousand!
- He's got dumps, and it's a sex-social field that works.
And on a cultural basis, 300 people will come, and 10,000 won't come, and in the end, less management, less money, everything will fade.
I've got fans, and the main thing is, don't fool them, don't ruin what I got.
I used to write a picture like this when I was a kid, one collector on a wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with a picture that's usually finished.
There's a lot of misconceptions right now.
They say a culture of spirit, a culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I'm a man of the culture of yesterday, grew up in the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, gave up money to draw paintings.
I'm for this kind of culture.
- Kirrill, what's wrong with St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's a concept: an official from a culture.
But not all of them can engage in culture.
With the right kings, things were not like this, the kings may not have understood the culture very well, but they understood the need to keep the right experts.
There's a good consultant in Moscow right now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're upside down, because we need higher experts who will be able to give them a proper assessment of the experts and give them a way to go.
Now the taste is thriving.
The same Erarta, but they're different from the fact that they're fair to say that not all modern art we take, there are artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is it for you - St. Petersburg?
-Petersburg is not a cultural capital. There's a lot more culture in Moscow. There's land.
And it's hard to grow art on our rocks.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers than readers right now, it's wrong.
There's a lot of curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of thinness.
We need to make fashionable art, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented with St. Petersburg Grant
Born in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earthmen on board are on their way to search for a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question is, how can we continue our generation in the face of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be learned hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars," he says, is a senior researcher at the State Astronomical Institute of P.C. Sternberg (GAIS) by Vladimir Surdin.
But if on Mars the conditions are more lifeable, then on the surface of Venus, the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at a high altitude or in a Venus orbit... in space.
The way to address the issues of reproduction in space began with flora.
We've been experimenting on plants half a century ago.
Four generations of in-orbit peas were no different from their earthly species.
And then, in an orbit of insects, a tiny fruit-drosophile fly.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to see how the foetus was developing under weightless conditions.
We get a perfectly normal chick on the way out.
And then there's the problem.
“The problem with this chick finding a support, he has to get up on his legs and start moving,” explains the head of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
After finding a stronghold, the chicks sprang in an unravelling way.
And after 10 hours, there was a complete atrophy of instincts in newborns.
The birds didn't react to the light or the sound.
And the problem was, after four days, they just died.
"And we've been hatching the chicks twice, and then we've refused, because it's just impossible to work with them there," states the failure of the experiment with the birds in space, Vladimir Sychev.
With animals, the last biological "minicocheg" was in orbit 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in spring 2013.
But the biosatellite "Bion" will have only same-sex faces.
There was an experiment with rats who had been sent to space with a foetus.
Basically, there was nothing supernatural out there.
"It was on biosatellite, but again, it's a single experiment, and it's a kind of research to do," observes Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the cosmic rats had a progeny.
But it's not possible to address the problem of breeding directly in space.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, when they lose the habit of living, just can't exercise their sexual instincts.
But a man, unlike a beast, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has an abstract mindset, and is able to make a proper emotional background.
For ethical reasons, no such experiment has been carried out.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
Tereshkova had the greatest risk.
And the most precious thing humans have is a woman's body.
Our Cup has left, and no one on Earth can tell us if it's going to last after a flight to space.
Can she have a baby after this flight?
"Before no one has answered this question," says the Vahtang Space Veterinary.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight to space, Valentine Tereshkov's first female cosmonaut gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savitsky, a second cosmonaut, was born in orbit twice and even in outer space.
But the risk remains.
We don't have enough, we have one of the cosmonauts who have been spared after long flights, and we're growing a healthy generation.
"And if there is more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia, Valery Polakov.
And yet, humanity needs to find some new ways in biotechnologies, protection from radiation, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPU Hydrolaboratorium is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in the context of a zero-swimming environment, the cosmonauts are working in outer space.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults, even if it's comfortable, but it's an alien environment, then for infants, it's a natural element.
The small ithianders seem to confirm that life on land has come out of the ocean.
There's a connection between the fact that the baby has been in mom's occult liquid for about nine months, and it's easier for him to get used to water.
In principle, it makes sense, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bathing, it takes only two weeks.
"It's very small to forget something," says the breast-trainer Marina Axenova.
In short, if the birth of a child is more natural, then for a woman, it's the gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly, the abdomen, the pelvis, the ability to push the foetus is dazzling.
All right, let's put it down by relying on birth stimulants.
We can, of course, go to a special cell to give birth, she'll push it out.
"And then what?" asks the non-trivial questions of Valery Polakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without a sense of Earth’s gravity, the body will not form a skeleton or a muscular system.
A newborn in an orbit cannot, like an adult, be dressed in a special fit-for-training dress.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital.
"And this experiment, which you and I are going to do, by allowing a baby to be born in a foreign environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled, completely disadapted man," foreshadowed by the head of the IMBP RAN Bioethics Committee, Igor Pestove.
As long as the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
But, after a while, it will be a reality when the Earthers on their ships go to a distant planet, which will be home to their descendants born in space.
The Chief of the General Audit Office: The squartz system has failed because of the politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the existence of quality legislation, is lagging behind in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview with Aktualn.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it has to be applied in the right way, which, in my view, we do not have enough," commented on Cal's current situation.
Such findings provide a joint inspection of the Czech and German control authorities.
As an example of bad practice, Peter’s approach to the so-called Schwartz system is not timeless.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the PDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not disturb business by checks - is it outlawed or allowed?
“The law should be in any way established, and, if it forbids anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the institutions that are required to verify and enforce the obligations”, states Kala.
At a meeting of the audit committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the law on public procurement of the two countries was compared.
What was the point?
This is a parallel test that we started probably two years ago.
Simply put, the point is that European law affirms how public procurement is to take place, followed by national law and then also in practice.
All the information has been gathered and, even with an unfinished check, there are interesting differences - to put it simple, we can have "precise and unmistakable" legislation, but in the application, we give way to Germany in some respects.
It follows that it is not enough to establish more and more refined rules, but to focus on the application of the law itself.
And in fact, how can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this kind of joint control that can contribute to the efforts to stop the clarification of laws, to reduce and to improve restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
The economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) cost to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not a fact that we're gonna do it by lowering the order limit.
Perhaps this system will be filled with “papers” so that those who want to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the limit hadn't been lowered.
You're talking about internal problems in the practical application of public procurement laws.
And how does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization like our HRW (Control and Audit Office) there, or does it work differently?
As far as the institutions are concerned, there is a Bandesrechtnungshoff, which is based on our principle, and there is a panel that works a little differently, but most of the two institutions work the same way.
In addition, the powers are to a certain extent similar, but as Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units at the federal level - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only run federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Courts of Account.
As far as local law is concerned, it's easier than we do?
In fact, I don't want to make a comparison without specific data, but in some respects, Germany can be taken as a model, but it can't be said to be the best in all things.
Is that because they're better with control?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like such comparisons.
But it has to be said that even model countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefit from working with our office, right?
With regard to domestic law, how has the amendments to the Public Procurement Act affected your institution in some way?
Given that the legal effect of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet been manifest in our verification work.
Since we are monitoring the fact, some delay must be taken into account.
We've only taken this into account in the process of preparing future checks -- we've started using our new tool, "Detecting the risk of inefficiencies," through which we ran almost 14,000 state contracts -- we've analyzed them -- and, of course, these changes are going to occur, because of the changes in restrictions, the changes in the terms of certain types of tenders, etc.
Do you think the adoption of this law will be of benefit or an additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be.
The problem that may arise is that the rules are “hardened up” and cannot be followed.
In the operation of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to a supplier (e.g., regional operational programmes - to a regional council) in that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in such a way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal error that does not affect a decision.
Such a system would only put even more pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the DPP would not disturb the business with the so-called swarts system.
"Swarts system" prohibited or allowed?
The law should be in any way established and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the bodies that are required to verify and enforce the obligations.
You can say, "We're gonna change this law and we're gonna let it go," but you can't say we're gonna pretend like nothing's going on.
The Public Procurement Act contains rather strict rules, as and what should be formalized, and this is the right thing to do, to protect public procurement.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied in the right way, which, in my view, we do not have enough.
Roads are slippery, but mostly passable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snowed.
They're mostly passersby, but somewhere with more care.
Carlovar Region
This morning, on the Karlover side of the road, there was a pass, but somewhere cold and snowy.
Temperature has fallen from five to ten degrees below zero, but must warm up a bit during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, with a small layer in the lowlands alone.
But on the ridges of the Ore Mountains lies about 30 cm of snow.
From the information from the regional roadworkers, it was reported that there was a lower visibility due to the mist.
The R6 and first-class roads in the region are now free.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface can be frost and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to Class II and Class III, including mountain paths, are passable.
But some of their plots still contain the leftovers of frozen snow and snow.
We need to be particularly careful on the roads on the elevations.
Pardubitsk and Kralovegradetsk
The Czech Highway and Highway Authority on its Internet page informs that some East Czech roads are threatened by a holodef, while highland and mountain roads may be hit by a snowy layer.
Regional roadworkers warn drivers of hololds, which can be found in particular on the highlands of the Pardubic province.
The holode may be near Lanchkroun, Usti nad Orlici, Polica, Sweetavi or High Mito, especially on the second and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Sweetavi are treated with chemicals.
The snow lies especially on the roads of Krkonoše and the Orlic Mountains.
The rocky snow is on the roads on the highlands in the regions of Richnov nad Knenovo and Trutnov.
In Eastern Czechs today, the variable clouds are not rainy.
Temperature usually ranges from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Pilsensk
Roads in Pilsensk are on the way this morning, but places need to be cautious and adapt to the weather.
It's cold in the morning, the temperature is between three and nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and after cooling in some places, it can be slippery.
Drivers may encounter a mist in the area, but the visibility will gradually improve.
Information was provided by regional roadworkers.
The D5 route is now almost unlimited, but the road manager recommends that we be careful between 80 and 131 km.
Most of the first-class roads have a dry and extinct surface.
In Southern Plzny and Tahove, the land may be frozen.
The roads of Class II and Class III are wet, and in this case there is also a warning due to the possibility of slippery plots.
Drivers should be careful, especially on low-use roads in the Shumawa area.
Olomousk Rande
Drivers travelling on the highland of the Olomousk side of the road must now take account of the snowshare on the road.
It was left after the use of the chemicals in the Cervenogorsky saddle and on the road in the direction of the Svevisky Krshyz.
During the night, the snow caused the roadworkers to go out on the street, according to the traffic control, to fall about three inches of snow in Schumperka.
In other parts of the road, there are generally no restrictions.
"In the highlands of the Schumper lies the rest of the snow.
Drivers heading towards Jesenica must bear in mind the presence of snowshake in the Cervenogorian saddle,' said the Chean (Tschechian News Agency) today to the controller of the Sumperk Roads.
At night, their colleagues from Jesenica went to clear the roads, and they assured them that the roads on the hills after the chemicals had been treated were left bare and wet.
In Olomouc, the roads are easy to pass, but in Sternberg, drivers need to be sensitive to forest areas where the humidity still exists.
Austetsk, Liberian
This morning, roadworkers from North Bohemian report that there are a number of hard-to-pass places left.
According to the police database, in addition to a number of places with holold or snowed, a mountain road was closed from Telnica to the Clinica in the Ustecsk province.
The temperature also stays negative in the lowlands, so there is still snow and ice on the roads, and the lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Middle Mountain, are, on the other hand, not a problem, the roads are mostly dry.
There are still no reports of road traffic complications.
Roadworkers report the presence of a holold in the outskirts of Steti.
According to meteorologists, the conditions for his formation at night were ideal: it was raining all day long and melting snow, the sky was clear at night, and the frost began.
Harmful conditions are reported on the main road and on track I/13 on the border between the Austec and the Liberian province.
Tree branches, which affected the road itself, were forced to close the road to the Telnica in the Book, as a result of the swollen snow.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts, we want to generate positive energy.
What do you think of the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we, people, are getting so easy to catch.
Together with the band The Tap, we keep joking about this and say we're the only group in the world that can get enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In fact, in December, you're going to give a very unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you please give the readers more details about this?
This is a national fund-raising event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, the end of which was announced on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before this event, on December 20th, at 9 p.m., there are three parallel concerts in Prague, Brno, and Ostrava.
They will end, frankly, at a time when Kiribati, in the Pacific, is about 12 hours ahead of us, and the May calendar is over.
Who's got this idea in mind?
Originally, it was my idea, and then we all came up with our painter Gonza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to generate enough positive energy and to prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state of the world we will one day pass on to our children.
At the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keyboards against the end of the world, which can be bought at www.e-tap.cz, and can also support us.
The Tap Tap band, along with other musicians, also performed an anthem against the end of the world, called "The End of the World" .
Will one who is fond of YouTube listeners sing an anthem at these benefice concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if it's all going to work out and the end of the world doesn't come.
It'll be sang by all the performers at all the concerts at the same time.
The hymns will also be aired live on Czech TV.
Words to this song have written and played the role of Jesus in Tomasz Ganak's video, as well as Hindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also work with other people in Czech cultural life, as we do a lot of charities and concerts.
We're trying to be active in tying them up to these projects.
Turns out, a lot of people like to work with us, they're curious.
What's the profit from a concert against the end of the world?
In order to buy the equipment for the Free School of STUDEO, we've been doing this for the sixth year with the Tap civil association at the Institute of Edlikki.
Teachers regularly attend school in the Yedlikki Institute and have fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves don't have the means to go to the teachers, and we're trying to give them this opportunity.
As part of a project to build a new institution, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with the project.
There will be a number of bands and performers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We've been trying to draw up a program that will be of interest to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, the Superport Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango, and Irzy Souhi will take part.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such “grendiary events” in the future?
In May, we're going to be performing for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival, and here, of course, we're going to have an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we'd love to have a show at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we're in the United States, would very much like to make a presentation in Washington and Chicago.
You've got serious plans about the country, you've already been in Madrid, Brussels, London, and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their carriages have to travel in the luggage compartment, plus a lot of cargo and toolboxes.
But so far, we've been able to deal with it without any problem. The Czech Airlines ŠSA and British British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, and I've been amazed so many times.
Even in Moscow, from where we just got back, things went smoothly.
By travelling abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards persons with disabilities, etc.
What have you been up to?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other countries, where things work better than we do, in Russia we have seen that in the East we are still at the basic level.
Compared to Prague, there are a lot of barriers in Moscow, and it is still a wild place to move a man on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also, there's no such trivial stuff as giving way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Happily, there are already social organizations that are trying to focus people on the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the other hand, should we always catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to make it clear that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's normal for people with severe disabilities to move on their own on the street, to go to the toilet, to the museum, to go anywhere...
It's not very common that a large number of people with disabilities are taking an active part in public life, in which we're a bit ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or free will be one thing, but at the moment that we have some well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians, or jurists, things will really start to change.
So far, it's a one-time thing - people with strong will.
The Tap Tap band is now very popular, but we'll go back two years, so in 1998 what made you organize it?
I went to the Yedlikki Institute as an educator, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself and I'm also playing a saxophone, I've organized an interesting music club with my co-worker.
Well, in time, as our host Ladia Angelovic says, it's a bit out of control.
Has popularity come only in the last few years, or am I confusing something?
That's true, it helped us to start joining the celebrity singers and to work hard to promote the band.
We have come to the conclusion that a job that no one can appreciate is, in fact, as if it didn't exist.
Thanks to the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you have the goal of making The Tap Tap so good?
From the start, I felt their potential to do something extraordinary.
The show business is full of things imitating one another.
It's logical, all new things are taken with care, and it's going on for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who can see us is, of course, pity, it's natural...
But that pity is completely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not suffering and all the abandoned individuals we have to be sorry for.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities are doing something, it's not just for them, it's for the whole of society.
Has it been a success that you are a strict guide, as many think you are?
If we want to do a job of good quality, we have to be in a lot of things uncompromising and disciplined.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic picture and fly in the clouds, and when they find out they have to go to rehearsal twice a week, attend prep classes, and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose their enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and do something.
At present, the band is made up of 20 members of The Tap Tap.
How many were there in early 1998?
There's only one Ladia Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it can't be prevented.
For those who have will and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno at the Fléda Club, and in Ostrava at the Plynojem Center, with the participation of 12 bands and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are reunited with the TV at the time of the band's "Tap Tap" song, "The End of the World" .
The aim of this project is to raise 25 million kroner of funding for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at the Institute of Edlikki in Prague.
The concert ticket is 400 kroner, and the entrance is free for kids under 12 years, and you can buy tickets at Bohemiatiket in advance.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of European Space Agency ministers, Poland was accepted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has been active in a number of Agency projects in the following years.
But Poland's way to space has been much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts used to fly to space, but that was not always the case.
I would like to recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld, who, on 6 December 1933, presented ideas to the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory from his pioneering work "Introduction to Space."
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, and after a few years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltry and Andre Luis Hirsch award for "Introduction to Space."
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), quoted above, later became a great propagator of astronomy and space.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and has written a number of books on these sciences.
Gadomsky has become a well-known world space propagandist, and his contribution has been appreciated, including the fact that one of the craters on the back of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a rail train was built in Poland with a missile engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the idea was not known, nor was the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a rocket was to be used to break up the cart or to stop it.
Information about this is only available from the press of that era.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to think about the rockets.
The study was carried out by the Armament Engineering Section in cooperation with Professors Mélislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokjitski.
The remaining material shows that the studies have reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the German troops coming, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the Specialized Press introduced the idea of a photovoltaic fighter missile, which was proposed by the Rogozinski engineer, and the following year, the work of the author, Lelili-Kivoblocski, was carried out by an air-toped and air-bombed missile.
Both projects have been developed for the military use of missile engines.
Prior to the war, all the missile-use projects were run by the Tymczasawy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy, which coordinated all the work.
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work was completed due to the outbreak of the war.
The next scientific work on space has appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polkie Towarzystwo Astronomyczne).
For the first time, there is a reference to society in the November 1954 issue of the Journal of Problems, which publishes four voluminous articles on Astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich offered to organize a space society.
At the time, artificial satellite projects were already on the move, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (PAA) has tried to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951), and it has become a real member in the fall.
And the following year, the first Chairman of the PAA, Cazirez Zarankewicz (1902-1959) became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PAA has made a significant contribution to the development of the very successful Meteorological Missile RM (Raquieta Meteorologiczna), which was the first Polish missile to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first was launched on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, which was able to cross a distance of 1,800 m, was about 80 cm long and was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 a two-stage RM-2 missile was tested on the Bledovsk Desert.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already in a position to do real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could have crossed 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the high wind.
But in 1962, further development was put on hold.
The origin of the first RM-type missiles was a Meteor-1 missile, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed to be two-stage, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, which differ in size for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A missile had a space of 0.4 litre, Meteor-1B a space of 0.34 litre, and Meteor-1C a space of 0.62l.
The maximum range for all three types of flight was 37 km.
In the period between 1965 and 1968, a Meteor-2 missile was developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first flight test began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 missile with a 380 kg start-up weight was able to produce a useful 10 kg load up to a height of about 60 km.
The versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were then built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland ' s joining COSPAR (Space Research Committee) in 1960 and the creation of a COSPAR national committee two years later.
In addition, under the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermashzewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Public Works Act.
The decree has given rise to a lively debate in society.
It would certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU, as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with one another.
This is linked to the principle of free trade and free, unlimited private capital flows, together with unbridled financial speculation.
A major difference in the cost of the labour force (wage) results in a price stress.
By this concept, it is necessary to understand the state of a producer who, by delivering a low-value product, tries to resist economic competition by “defying” the value of a competitor in order to take up most of the market and thus increase his or her own income.
On a massive scale, this means that most businessmen are either moving their output abroad, making low-cost purchases abroad, or disappearing; as a result, unemployment is rising in countries where the cost of the labour force is high in comparison with others.
Since private capital has no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it has done, the State ' s inescapable social spending is on the rise.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of businessmen to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the social economic and social damage they cause in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to give specific statistics.
Uncertain practices of private capital have created a situation at the level of the economies of individual States in which national Governments have to compete with one another in order to artificially lower the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are delegating their own people to arbitrariness in private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected above all in the changes to existing legislation.
The aim is to make their people comply economically with the demands of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic compulsion in the event of long-term unemployment, while at the same time serving as a means of curtailing the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
As a result, the level of poverty and the difference between the poor and the rich are increasing.
For a number of years, the Federal Republic of Germany has had a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is about a million.
As part of the improvement in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constant cases in which employed people receive such a wage that the State has to pay them to earn a minimum of living.
Such a scandal has become known to the public in the case of the Bundestag's additional employees.
Economic measures in almost all of the Southern EU states have no doubt led to the same state in which people who are under the pressure of a catastrophic social decline are either forced to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to exist on a low wage at the back of society in the hope that private investment capital will one day enter the country.
But where would it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as the Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turks, Moroccan, Egyptian, African is still working for the European wage.
This applies to Latin America as a whole.
Liberal theories and the media make it nauseous to say that the State cannot share in the capital of its own economy, which is the result of an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the State should not interfere with the economy.
The next question to be answered is, is not private capital now practically running politics and the whole State for its own selfish purposes?
The answer is yes.
The existence of almost all-powerful and universal lobbying in all States is proof.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation of corruption, of mutual benefit, in a law where almost everything deserves to be punished, but it is not a crime.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the Government ministries, due to a lack of financial resources, are delegating draft legislation to private legal firms that are closely linked to the industry.
These bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
The whole power is not from the people, as the Western-type constitution states, but from the financial-powered groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracy is now in a situation as described by Appian in the work of the “Crisis of the Roman Empire in Caesar's and Pompeius' Days”:“The State has been dissolving for a long time, and the agencies are engaged in violence.
Bribery, illegal receipt of favors with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any ban, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote" ......the right people didn't run for the position of ruler at all, eventually one day the state was left without a consul for eight months ... ... ... ... "The only way to save this terrible situation is to be self-sustainable and the need to choose a strong man " .
As in ancient times, today ' s society predominates its own senseless interests without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital is no longer inherently for public use.
The present result is no different from the past: the unparalleled decline of the elite without any effort to reform a deeper character.
So the reason for the emergence of fascist and communist regimes is that we must look in the reckless liberalisation of economic systems for 19 and 20 centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal-type democracy can be viewed as a certain pause after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite has completely ignored the consequences of the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with the crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a decision, or at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and the national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to look for ways to further lower the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore a system-wide one.
The solution was targeted political and social reform, which would strengthen the State ' s share of the economy, enhance the role of citizens in public administration and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: The Laboratorium of Chaos.
"Nothing can come out of the violence, and it can't come out." Sting, the song "Stroke," where the main verse of the refren is "we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, they wouldn't have been." - The dying Gutel Schnapper, the wife of Meir Amchel Rothschild.
The last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, generated a host of reactions.
Some argue for Israel ' s position on the basis that it has the right to self-defence, while the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians on the basis of the racism of the Israeli State, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to think about who, in this recurrent wave of murders, is a criminal, and who the victim, after all, is today's Israeli citizens, including self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation, and have not witnessed the outbreak of violence.
My goal is to invite the readers to look behind the curtain, to see who has been the main focus of the 95-year-old stress (regarding the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small part of the land of the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is backed up by historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main engine of modern history.
The history of humankind is, above all, a history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their steps on their own, or behind their throne was someone who directed their actions to predetermined goals.
It should be assumed that we are living in a time when the world ' s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a number of individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that stems from it has not been possible in a single generation.
One of the astronomically rich families is one that could be viewed as a stifling head (I don't know if anyone's standing over them, but it's not ruled out) - the Rothschilds.
There's not much to write about.
Of course.
The first news agency, Reuters, was bought in the 19th century to stop the rumours linking their name to the high-level criminal actions in the shadows of which they were, and which have always led to the strengthening of their power, to the growth of wealth, or at the same time to both.
They have large stockholdings in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they have no share, they are waging or preparing a war (there were only seven countries before the invasion of Afghanistan, there were five countries after the invasion of Iraq, but at the same time the Russian Government took over the central bank of its country).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of a central bank in Rothschild Bank of America, and in the civil war he began to release his own (ponima - government) money, and was killed in 1865 in the theatre.
John F. Kennedy began to release his own money, and he wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963, and MP Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for launching the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their yearning for world power from 1859 to 1871 led to a plan for three world wars, created by the Great Masson of the 33rd level, Albert Pike.
The first war was the destruction of the Monarch States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial rule, especially Britain, and the third was to reduce the world ' s population to about 0.5 to 1 billion (the number of slaves would be enough to provide for their comfort and luxuries, and they would not use much of their resources), the creation of a united universal religion (ecumenism can be no more than a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families, led by the Rotschilds, works is to challenge the crisis and then propose solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
But these solutions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, which was to prevent the recurrence of the crisis that they caused in 1907).
So, after they managed to wage the First World War by killing the Heir of the Austrian-Hungarian Throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia, starting with the Bolshevik Revolution.
The first world war ended with a sudden, undue military and economic capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary to destroy the royal Russia) and as a result, the Central European Power, Austria-Hungarians, was shattered.
To ease the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation by imposing massive military reparations on Germany, which created the prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then left to give the Germans a strong enough, blaming the culprits and offering the Chief's simple decisions, to further set up a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed played the role of a fifth column, in fomenting the fire of war.
In the late 19th century, the Rotschilds provoked the foundation of a Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to form a Jewish State, preferably in the area of the history of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour declaration created a prerequisite for the massive immigration of the Jews to Palestine, and the first confrontations with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have taken place on both sides.
The Second World War erupted, it was hard to see if Hitler had broken out of the chains in which he was initially held by the bankers, or whatever he had done was planned, in any event the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, as Germany was provoked by the military reparations for the 2nd World War, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a hotbed of war.
If international bankers are able to unravel it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will be the victims of fighting on the frontline, now with the Arab or, in short, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a gigantic lab, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (to take only the sharp division of people into Israel’s supporters and opponents).
Who is to blame, and who is to be the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment engenders resentment in an endless cycle of violence, if it all began with the greed of individuals and their quest for world power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we do, international bankers are putting people to vote for their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, the Netanyahu hawk, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international banker politician who is doing his best to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran ' s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to turn into a world conflict, and, given Iran ' s control of the Ormuz Strait, which contains 20 per cent of the world ' s oil reserves (the maritime corridor is only two miles wide) will also bring about the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "All we need is a common crisis, and people will adopt a new world order."
The new world order in their view is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population is a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every organ born at birth is implanted with a chip, with which it becomes a thing under total control.
"And make all small and big, rich and poor, free and slave to have a mark on his right hand or forehead, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast, or the number of his name, can neither buy nor sell.
Here's the wisdom: everyone with the mind can count the number of the beast.
For it fits the human name, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
"Operation Argo": When it's worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist demon students seized the U.S. Embassy in Teheran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the demolished Shah, Mohammed Reza Pechlevi, who fled after the US revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, no positive outcome was expected - it could not afford to throw a check overboard, because it would have the root of undermining the trust of allies in other countries.
But to secure the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not in a position to do so.
It was a blow to the image of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
Detainees were finally released 444 days later, after the negotiations, mediated by the Government of Algeria.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiments at home.
The fall in Iran has greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which ended with the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, "Operation "Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that has led to America's small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, the six employees managed to escape.
After a difficult period, they completed their journey to the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, was able to take them out of Iran, with the help of an extravagant cover-up legend, according to which they left Canada's passports as members of the survey team, who were looking for a place in the country to film a sci-fi epoch.
Combination of genres
The plan that Tony Mendez's "evacuation" expert invented called for Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to make the legend sound, specialized magazines wrote about the film project, press conferences were held, and a fictional manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been a secret for a long time, a movie based on Tony Mendez's memoirs.
Afflek's movie is a special mix of a few genres.
On the one hand, the real political triller, the so-called movie-kino-opus, the story of a good idea, the scam -- an example can be a series of films about Ocean's friends.
The film has a constant change of spirits - on the one hand, the documented scenes from Teheran (the titles show the iconic historical images of events and the way in which the same situations have been shown in the film - there is no big difference).
On the other hand, the lightened Hollywood excerpts cross with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then there's the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits are talking about the situation at the table, at the staircases of the institutions, on the phone...
Ben Afflek was very successful in relaunching his career.
From a laughed actor, he became a respected director, and his game was no longer the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third full-length movie, after a dark Detective "Good-bye, baby, good-bye" (2007) and a Triller "City" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Afflec movie to be filmed in the hometown of the director, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place is one of the qualities that elevated earlier films of the director over the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is doing it in Argo, where Teheran is playing Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the street, when real events are rebuilt - the opening scenes of the fall of the embassy are impressive by their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of the confusion and unforeseeableness that occur when the story suddenly changes.
Afflek and his colleagues have a similar effect in the scenes of imaginary (forged headquarters at the Teheran market).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that narratives do not imply many exciting scenes of film value.
He's doing pretty well with this few, sometimes he's thinking something -- it's not all so elegant -- a scene in which a phone call in America prevents an imminent crisis at the airport of Teheran, and a runway chase is pretty clever.
Argo's shortcoming is the dispersion associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman, as Hollywood co-workers, are indeed very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they're not the only ones in the movie.
Afflek's movie lacks a bit of drama, it's a movie that can be viewed with a moderate interest, analyzing the play and the retro-styl that is re-creating the trillers of the '70s.
But it's hard to catch up.
This, however, is enough to remind us of one, still in a certain way of life history, as well as to show how the image of all-powerful and all-encompassing intelligence services has been overstated.
Inflating rules for balloons, bananas and the circus
The portal www.bankovnipplatky.com, which conducts an annual poll on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to declare a competition for the “most absurd order or project from the EU's workshop”.
“We have been prompted by the last event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major European companies,” said “the right” by the interviewer Patrick Nager.
Among the absurdities that have already been nominated is the recent decision of the European Court to merge the rate of premiums for men and women.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits, as they are objectively less likely to be at risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredibly inconceivable ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place until the end of February 2013,' said Nager.
EU disputing orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which is harmful to nature, as well as the ban on the use of reliable mercury-grades just because they contain a relatively small number of dangerous substances, or a directive on the size of a chicken cell, which has led to a significant loss of eggs this year.
The actual ban on the use of the term “butter oil” or the exemption from the sale of classic light bulbs was also criticized.
Qualitative bananas must be 14 cm long.
The Pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by a State or group of States (in this way, the Czech Republic now, even under the threat of a branch, defends the claims of its banks).
The lobby's interests are this: for example, the European Union's top-quality bananas were supposed to be 14 cm long and dared not to be anomalous.
At the same time, the European Commission was justified by the fact that it only harmonised existing disparate national rules that made trade more difficult.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, has nevertheless relaxed the standards for fruit and vegetables, citing the fact that the existing directives will lead to the waste of products.
The EU regulation last year may also be the candidate for the poll, according to which the air balloons that sell must be provided with a warning that children under the age of eight cannot inflate them without adult care.
The EU has approached American research, according to which balloons in the game are a potential cause of death by suffocation.
Such a restriction now applies to children up to the age of 14, who are not allowed to use their rags.
Funny ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning European officials themselves is rather absurd: everyone who has an official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitiveness of the subject for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, but should instead say “BURM” (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com Portal, in cooperation with a group of liberal economists, Laissez Faire, has put forward for a vote, in addition to the above-mentioned absurd rules, such as the EU rule on the size of food stocks in the territory of a member State.
The EU has set the maximum level of food reserves that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day it joins the European Union.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, the prescribed levels of canned mushrooms, for which it was subject to a heavy fine.
The idea of paying some countries for not having a sea and the idea of granting grants for a grant application was also of interest to the organizers of the questionnaire.
But these ideas came from Prague, not from Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we do not have the sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation,” said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas, in the fall of 2004.
As an argument, he said that the country had a high grain yield, and as a result of so-called intervention procurement, the State had full stock holdings, which needed to be removed.
For being far from the ports in the Czech Republic, the EU, according to Palas, should have paid us hundreds of millions of Euros.
As a result, the European Commission has met the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grains from land-locked countries.
Subsidies for a grant have been offered to the villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Paul Deutsche (US-DEU), in particular, to make an application for a grant from Brussels.
EU: Funny orders are the exception
While regulations in member States are easily subject to criticism, EU regulatory efforts, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the EU, are seen by many experts to be more welcome.
A major problem, according to experts, is to draw EU grants on projects that do not even have a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but that the member States have achieved in the budget discussion.
It is emotional among the Czechs and that, as in other European Union countries, the Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for the right to be specific in the identification of its traditional products, and it has not always won in this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians, have kept the name "Olomous Cheese," but the "Toumian rum" is a 19th-century tradition in our country, our producers were to be renamed "Tuzemac."
You can only call it rum from cane distillates, not sugar beet.
The official list of the EU's registered products, along with the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from the German Lubec or parm ham, has already been found, for example, in Carlovars, in Gorgelic, and intrigued carp, and in Ham.
The brand name of the EU can also be proud of the Pardubian carrots and the Gorge tubes.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura claims.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come to run for president?
I don't think about being a senator or a president myself.
If everything in this country worked out without a problem, I wouldn't run.
But I can't watch the country crucify over the last 20 years, how thieves are fussing, how people get their taxes up, how old they are.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to find a way to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old, and I'm an independent non-partisan, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You hit the Senate, but you soon went to the presidential castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I've always said I'm going to fight for the presidential lock, depending on the result of the senatorial election.
Later, I clarified that if I were to be elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not to be a position, a position is a tool by which I can exercise my views.
So I need the most influence and the greatest authority.
But the problem is not just that we're a nation murmuring at our bar or at the TV, but we're ready to trample on everyone who's trying to make a difference.
In addition, media that stigmatize people and confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
For example, I was told that I was giving bribes to the press, or that I was an adviser to Irgi Paroubek.
Let's get to your point of view.
The fight for the Presidential Castle you began with talking about the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and about back-to-back property declarations worth more than 20 million.
To do so, the law must be changed.
You don't have such powers as president, and only the entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to do this?
When I lobbied as a citizen to make the tours a free business, it progressed.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or on the right, they willfully take up the obstacles, and it stops the citizens.
As an independent, non-partisan man, I have a much greater potential to receive support from all the parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country without a party's racking, without looking at the dogmats, and apply it.
Do you think you're more right-handed or left-handed?
From a Czech point of view, I think I'm more of a left.
It doesn't matter to me at all, a little left or a little right.
It's important to me that we go ahead.
It's not about someone on the right, it's about someone on the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good public decision as to whether it is offered by the HRCM or the HDP, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You're mad when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you say?
When you make a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already in the world, or are spoken of by prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you will have only slogans.
And with this, you won't last long in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out to the people and talk to them, you will be able to implement criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another chance.
Just persuading politicians, journalists, and the public, and trying to lure them to their side so we can get what we want.
If I had been elected President, it would not have been a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would call on the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legitimize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they don't, they'll have to tell us why they don't want to.
If there is a strong person who speaks of abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was the public pressure.
I'm telling you, I'm a fan, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies to stand up to my beliefs and views.
I'm just beginning in politics, and for my program, I'm gonna try to get the support of the majority.
I'm trying to move things forward on my own; if it can't, I'll be done in six years and I'll be back in the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm the one who won't do anything, so I've overcame a number of well-known people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Janchure, he refused for a lot of work.
I also supported at least the leading investigative reporter Jan Lorentsov, who has discovered the fraud of light oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but I feel like I'm on the balance right now.
Sixty per cent of the people didn't go to the polls, and most of the people who went to the university chose.
There are only two of us who are independent in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate in such a way that the changes will be difficult to implement.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about the basis of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to test the cleanness of every potential supporter's past, and I don't have the money to do it.
There's no money for the presidential campaign, and my transparent account is only $20,000.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and what's the status of your own business with this?
Personal property is estimated at about 60 million.
I have a land in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, an art collection of about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and a Skoda Superb for a million, and a few more million on the account.
By the way, Aston-Martin came up because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was driving, was gallant with women, and at the same time was fighting against vileness and lawlessness.
You go to Aston Martin, you own property for 60 million, and you don't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very persuasive.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to get into debt?
I've already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors is that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my pocket.
The campaign's cost will in fact cover my senator's salary.
But I wouldn't live with that money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school that cost 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run anywhere.
So you're going to be doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut it off?
But it doesn't depend on how much it pays.
As I have promised, I have cut down in part.
For example, my deputy will be the manager of a travel agency in spring.
People would want me to be an insidious man who will keep the Republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you accustomed to getting monthly?
From 200 to 400 grand, which I keep getting.
And if I was the president, I'd end my business.
You will find a full interview in the Saturday issue of The Right.
MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not just imaginary -- in the example of Spikenissa and his recently built Book Mountain -- two photos.
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, and we can finally see something interesting again," says Lizette Verhaig, walking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in a nearby big company, says, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we have another library today?
We all have Internet, iPad, and e-books.
No one goes to such old-fashioned libraries anymore, right?
The spakenisse, a small-scene town near Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this unfortunate situation, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to build seven fictitious bridges on euro banknotes in the form of painted miniatures of iron beton.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And that's when the city's dads realized that they had the only way to beat the stats: to build a library here!
Vini Maas, from the MVRDV, a master of bold column charts, and the author of witty, sometimes even cynical structures, took up the task with his normal complacency and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003, with five books under his mouse and a smirk on his face.
And while the members of the jury glanced at and shook their shoulders, the insolent Maas folded out of his original gift a piramide in size and completed a speech in defence of his project with the words, "Respected citizens!"
Here's my offer: "The Book Mountain" in Speichenis, so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain rose at a cost of 30 million Euros.
It is part of the revitalisation project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and a number of surrounding homes andtowns for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the "Bible Mountain" was the second award of the 2012 Best Library of the Netherlands.
The project also participates in the 2012 National Dutch Wood Contest.
So the faceless suburbs, who had been able to offer nothing but a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly city city whose white facades suggest a dairy plant, have become richer on one modern piece of architecture.
But most of all, the first public building in the history of this town has been created in Spikeniss.
A Long Way to a Book
First impression: Eldorado's book under a cheese cap.
There's only one elevator in the center of the mountain range, because real fans of architecture and reading would prefer to explore this area on foot.
Glassed on all sides - light and easy to see, baked brick floors and elegant streetlights unmistakably create a sense of public urban space.
The urban environment has been rebuilt ideally.
The look is unwittingly looking for bench, dog, and football-playing boys and girls.
And there are books, books, books.
"Of course, the bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle there is a big dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless," says Vini Maas.
We put the classical configuration of space on the head, and we pulled out the area to read from the inside out.
The inner area of the Booksberg has been used skillfully: the center has offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental center, and technical facilities.
The black bookshelves, which are used to trim the walls, the parapets, and the staircases, are particularly refreshing.
Their kind, texture, and smell are unusual.
Even the inexperienced architects and architects are lost in guessing what the unknown material is.
"We've been trying to work with secondary material," explains Jop Trowborst, a project manager representing the community of Spannisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once, at a single farm in Frisland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years in the greenhouses and in the fields in the Netherlands, artificial fibrous material of millimetre thickness has been used as a support to the root.
It's cheap and it saves time.
The thin textile is one or two seasons, and can be discarded.
For the library, this painting, for the first time in such a volume, was pressed in a four-centimetre-cold bar.
With heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplastic (KLP) is transformed into a dark, homogeneous, solid material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit of a sneaker.
There are 105 steps to the top.
The one who crosses the path of almost 500 meters will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and wood ficuss in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all about the right air humidity on the literal mountain.
The cost of a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model project in terms of the environment," says the Troubhorst.
Heat and cooling are used for heating and cooling.
Although the Book Mount is under a glass cap, even on clear days, the sun will not come in for long.
Large wooden farms, located at right angles in the glass facade, provide a shadow and take on most of the solar rays.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic rolled curtains.
Stefan Spermon, quoted above as an IT skeptic, has already visited a new library.
Lisette Verhaig was here, too.
And also a traditional Chinese medicine teacher, cynthia Bogard, who called Buchenberg "the soul of the Spanisse, who has been short for a long time."
The reason is that a few weeks before the opening, everyone was invited to donate a book from their own congregation.
These books were supposed to take up empty spaces on the shelves of the unfilled library at the time it had 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelves are up.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says the architect Vini Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, everyone is now in a way connected to this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
So MVRDV was able to solve a royal task, which is called the creation of identity in a professional jargon.
Spikenissa wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for building identity.
Sabo: "The Germans have a more important role to play."
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
In the view of Stephen Sabo, an expert in the US-Europe connection, in doing so, Berlin is on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first indicated that it would vote against the Palestinian application for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany must now be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I do not think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to show its independence, without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote to impose a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO made this proposal.
Is it hard for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is, it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, that is, moving from the policy that the US was, so to speak, to the very German foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans are back between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to it.
I think they're just finding out what they're doing, but they're on the way to a more normal foreign policy.
The kind of foreign policy that France or the United Kingdom has pursued.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy from a German point of view mean?
It is a willingness to take a national stand independent of the position of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is dependent on economic policy, that is, export and links to certain regions, such as Russia, China, or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests differ to a large extent from those of other major States, and Germany must therefore defend its interests.
Did these economic interests have an impact on the position in the Middle East conflict and on the United Nations vote?
First, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Gulf States.
It must therefore be careful not to offend the public and the elite in the Arab countries.
In any event, it has a role to play.
But I wouldn't give it too much meaning, it's not a complete one-sided connection.
But in any event, it's an important part of the Germans' calculations.
Has Germany harmed its relationship with the United States by refraining from making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe, and even in the US, there is a prevailing understanding of the German position.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as it was in the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
Indeed, it signalled that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
On the contrary, the United States has made clear its support for the veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the US and many European States?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government, in its heart, has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But in view of the local political situation, the Government, of course, cannot take this position outright.
I believe that the fundamental differences of opinion are not as significant as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you'll notice that Obama is not at all in love with Netanyahu's policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close links with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the EU's most important partner on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so hard for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a bit easier for the Germans if there was a single, uncontroversial European policy, but now it is not.
Therefore, they cannot take a wider approach and must instead act on the basis of their own vision.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in fashioning a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of its links with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not take the lead?
Or is Germany still having a hard lead role?
Germany is not accustomed to this, it is still always uncomfortable, and, for obvious reasons, it is always hard to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes on an important role, a wide range of anti-German sentiments emerge.
The Germans don't just deal with it.
In fact, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much worse position than the US.
It has to take into account a wide range of neighbours and views, which is not easy.
So, the US’s influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at this moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, so who is left?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don't like it, it's not good or it's not good to love you, it's life!

"Protection of Trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous trade mark, and Polo Ralph Lawrence is also.
But what is Armani Polo?
It's a fully-registered name in China that has nothing to do with the firms from which it is created.
It will, however, be protected until the original names have been sued.
But it is also not clear whether they will be able to assert their rights.
"Foreigners are getting more and more difficult to defend their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a Taylor Wessing lawyer specializing in violations of trademark rights in the Far East.
There's a new case like this on my desk every week.
The simulators will have to add just a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So Gucci is a Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German enterprises, such as the Puma-manufacturer, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with records of the Department of Trademarks in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered a trade name for Zegna DF Puma, also known as Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are the world's champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is known.
There are multi-story shops in big cities that sell almost exclusively forgery.
But Pattloch's cases are not the same, and on the instructions of his confidants, he is opposed to the fact that Chinese enterprises are officially entitled to use a name that is already being protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "ban minpai," a stamp-passer.
The word is associated with a "Bank docuan."
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not confess guilt
"It's bad for business, it has to be combated," Pattloch is convinced.
"The brand of commerce is washing up, the unique position is lost, the image is in a very bad way."
The financial and procedural costs of the affected industries are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to CLSA, China is the third-largest and fastest-growing market for luxurious items, with a value of 15 billion euro a year.
However, it is difficult to delete dubious records in the trademarks register, and it is expensive to do so.
The process can last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch speaks of the cases in which the court rejected the claims, as after a long time the objected name became a "market reality."
If the appellant is not lucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarism, as he has damaged his trade mark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes it's the law of the jungle.
There are also well-known cases of graphics.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal argument with a construction car manufacturer, Sany, a company that had recently acquired a Putzmeister concrete-sucker company.
So the Chinese still have the right to use a label like a Mercedes star.
The company that bought Volvo, Geely, originally used a blue-and-white logo like BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
Lacoste, a fashion producer, lost to Hong Kong and Singapore simulators in China, where the famous crocodile was looking the other way.
The Chinese authorities don't think they're guilty.
The CTMO Department of Trademarks in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to a shortage of staff and facilities.
But last year, there was a "return from an emergency in the working process to a normal."
For example, the number of unsolicited objections cases has fallen by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been closed, an increase of 75 per cent over the previous year.
However, 81.500 claims are still pending with the agency.
The cost of fighting it is high
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, about a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China has, for the tenth time in a row, led the list of new registrations around the world, reports the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, to a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, a total of 1,8 billion yuan was paid.
Simplified, this means that each registration is on average 1280 yuan or 160 euro.
Protesting it is worth a lot more, as the case of the German family business Freidenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the firm has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarism.
The Germans have succeeded in putting an end to the illegal production of counterfeit car parts.
The simulator, however, reserved China's trade name for Freedenberg.
This was a personal omission, as the names in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Ventzler, Chairman of the Federal Special Missions in Munich.
And the CTMO Trademarks Department rejected the Munichs' claim.
True, in both of the following instances, Friedenberg has won, but the opposing side is still fighting.
You have to be on your watch.
The matter is currently before the Supreme Court.
Ventsler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and lauds the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is very expensive and it takes us a lot of time, money, and nerve."
The internal costs are hardly countable, and the company's archive has had to look at even a hundred-year-old act to prove it.
Five years ago, Freudenberg inconclusively offered the opposing side a “six-digit sum in euro” for a settlement.
"It's clear from here how much it cost us," Ventzler says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to move even to Europe.
That is, if the simulators record unprotected trade marks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freedenberg for footwear and leather.
Concertion has long ceased production in these areas, but it has been able to prevent registration.
"We need to be on our guard," says Ventsler.
Both he and Pattloch's lawyer recommend that German businesses be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark protection, but rather to “all that is worth protecting, to be registered also in China”, Ventzler says.
Otherwise, it can cost a lot more than registration.
Indeed, if Freedenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the wrong side license fees for his own name, explains Ventzler.
Otherwise, we'll be out of the market in a debatable segment.
World AIDS Day: Singing, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Glee Club of Imbongi is rehearsing, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans enjoy it.
The history of a relationship that has been more than 8,733 miles [8,733 km].
First, a flooding is made: Cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' boots, and men's boots pick up a tack on the floor and find it fast.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly grow - alt, bass, tenor, and soprano - they come, enchant, and follow each other.
And Fate Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, is about to come out of his mattressed boots when he's flexibly and vocabulary.
The night of Monday, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Glee Club of Imbong is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty members of the choir from 23 to 69 years of age, from a human genetics specialist to a janitor, attended the rehearsal.
"Om Obani" is a tricky thing, every choir voice has its own text, and also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and some parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
Unaids estimates that there are about 34 million HIV-infected people in the world.
Of these, 23.5 million live in Southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 per cent of the population is HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Estgeni, Voices for Africa found the chiefs in Germany.
Of these, 70 attend a school that is ready for further education.
For 15 or 20 Euros a month, you can take the lead.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms, and a daily hot lunch at Gogo Center.
Imbongs in Zulu means a storyteller or an admirer.
They don't talk in this room fluently on the bow, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir learns the songs in this foreign soft language, and from time to time even brings them back to where they first appeared: south Africa.
After all, 8733 km of summer from Heidelberg, in the northwest of Swaziland, is the village of Estgeni, which is dependent on the voices of the German choir.
Infected 40 per cent
There are about 2,000 people, some still in simple huts of clay and straw, and there are many children among the population.
More than 300 of them have been left without parents who have died from the HF virus.
In Esytgen, the disease of Swaziland as a whole is reflected in a miniature: the highest level of HIV infection, the world ' s lowest life expectancy, as reported by UNICEF.
The circumcision of the extreme flesh of men, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is very low among the population.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland ' s population has a immunodeficiency virus in it, and it is not uncommon to die in the middle of the fourth ten.
The Glee Club opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but in the past, the participants in Imbohini saw a lot of children on the streets, who needed not only parental care, but also just all: food, clothing, education.
Without school, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
Initially, it was a private commitment by individual participants - for a few euro a year to send a child to school and to give him the opportunity to get hot meals once a day.
But a year later, the choir set up a group of Voices for Africa, which has since almost professionally cared for AIDS orphans in Estgeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the major sexually transmitted diseases?
They include syphilis, chlamydia, and tripper.
HIV, human papilloma-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis are common viral STIs.
Frontal paediatrics and scabies are parasitic STDs.
What are the main target groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhoea are found mostly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute understands that in at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, the transfer takes place as a result of sexual contact between men.
Heterosexual adults have common sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamydia, trichomoniasis, candidose, gonorrhoea, and human papilloma-virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
The incidence of chlamydia among young people is much higher than among other groups.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
We also have a common human papilloma virus among our young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been falling since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one-tenth less than the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the field of genitals, complaints from urination, excretion, pain at the bottom of the belly, and bubbles or seals.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and are unnoticed.
How can we defend ourselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contamination, but do not offer 100% protection.
In fact, part of the cause of sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact and close physical contact.
The experts therefore recommend a regular survey, especially in the case of a frequent change of sexual partners.
In early diagnosis, most STIs can be cured and far-fetched.
Chiefship, donations, and not least choir fees all over Germany, make it possible to collect something.
"All we've sent to Estgeny is about 200,000 Euros," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, the money from Germany is run by Sodwa Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also cares to make the orphan fit, such as one of her grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call it in Zulu old women, is the support of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphaned children, give them a roof over their head, and make sure that their uniforms show up on time every day in class.
Those who have no family members go to Hanysila's shelter, a single woman who is paid by the association, as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two henhouses, and, together with the U.S. health organization PSI, organized a HIV test for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but a disease so evident throughout the country tends to be silent.
King with 14 Wives
"Aids is absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's related to sexuality."
It's quite unusual for a country where the king has 14 wives.
The last absolute Monarch of Black Africa, King Misswati III, is known for his love for excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a State-sanctioned way of life is also responsible for the spread of the HC virus so quickly in past years.
But it also lies on wandering workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they're hardly used.
The other culture is flesh to flesh."
To support a little cultural exchange, the choir of Ibmogoni travels to South Africa every two to three years and sings songs full of sadness, spirit, confidence, and black self-consciousness, which many on the southern side of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites, singing songs in a black language -- such a confession not only brings good humour and joy, but even happened, caused tears in the eyes of hard border guards.
Visits also take place in Estgeni, where the singers attend the underwear.
Although a small village is hard to find on a map, it is more known in the Etsulveni Valley.
"Go to Estgeny, there's light," say the people here.
And after a 8733-km flight back to Heidelberg, when the drowning singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is on fire here, too.
Messinger: NASA opens the ice on Mercuria
The Messinger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercure.
Ice cover can be as thick as 20 meters.
The U.S. Space Department of NASA has shown that there is ice on the planet Mercure.
Although it is nearest to the Sun, it also has frozen water, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in a special journal, Science.
The Messinger has found evidence that the ever-scene region of the planet is covered with ice.
It should be at least 30 inches [30 cm] thick, perhaps even up to 20 meters [20 m].
The water is supposed to come from a comet, or possibly an asteroid, that is, from Mercurius.
No one is tying the ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the probe's scientist Sean Solomon.
The temperature at Mercuria can be as high as 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help to explain how water and other building blocks of life have come to other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticedly, the Earth's probes, telescopes, and small robots, such as Phoenix, are exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: little windows to endlessly.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who circles the Sun after Neptune, Ceres, by the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006, is not a "planet".
This fragment of the infrared image of the Spitzer Telescope represents a “family picture” of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots are more difficult to identify in the star circle the pink new-born stars.
This star-education region - scientists call it unromantly W5 - has been discovered by the Spitter Telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.

One of the greatest and clearest images of the Hubble Telescope: the Waterway Galaxie
Depending on the color transfer, images of spiral galaxies turn into real art.
The picture, published by the European South Observatory, shows the trifide nebula in the constellation of Streltsa, which was remote for a number of thousands of light-years.
The name Trifide stems from the Latin word trifidus (tribal, tridular), as the dark bands of dust divide the hot heart of the cradle of stars into three parts.
In the constellation of the Serpent, astronomers photographed a cosmic quake: 400 million light-years away from the Earth, the nucleus of the two merging galaxies is running towards each other and will inevitably run into one another.
This is the origin of the Hubble Telescope star filmed in the Spiral Galaxie of M83.
A person who doesn't like technical abbreviations can call it the Southern Chain Wheel.
A picture of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
Nebula, which is 1,400 light-years away, consists of dust fragments of 10 to 100 times smaller sizes than the normal home-grown dust.
The image was made of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years away from the Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, photographed the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The Great Spiral Galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star cradle is always making new stars.
This star cloud, connected to the Rosette Nebula, is also constantly creating new stars, at a distance of 5,000 light-years from Earth.
There's no dust in this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it occurred just before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly water.
Our View of the Universe: Critical Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersey, even before Galileo Galilei began to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optic telescopes have become more and more, and the spaces available to them have become deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., there is a Big Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter.
"Grand Telescopio Canarias" has a gigantic inner device, the diameter of a mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The Great South African Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to lower the cost.
However, it is about 11 meters in diameter.
Lack of inexpensive design: the telescope is tightly fastened at a vertical angle, limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
It's a feature: a high luminosity.
It reaches, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, the parameters of the world ' s largest telescopes.
By means of a radiotelescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the “Such of the extraterrestrial mind” (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing his or her computer power.
A view of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
There's a "Very Big Telescope" right here, completely in line with its name.
His four mirrors make it possible to light up even the middle infrared spectrum in the eye tube.
A European “Very Large Telescope” is also planned to be installed in the Chilean observatory.
His main mirror has to be as wide as 42 meters, and it's going to be made up of almost 1,000 mirrors.
Photographs, however, should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck Telescopes on the Hawaiian Mount Mauna Kea were considered the world's largest.
They have two mirrors of 10 meters in diameter.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which is also staring at the sky with the Subara and IRTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope, with a 30-metre-wide mirror, is to appear on Mauna Kea.
Here you can look at the illustrations.
However, the most important species in space supply the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been providing images of the worlds far away.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, especially those where life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been found since the start of the mission.
Photographs of the latest designs of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be sent to space until 2018 on the Ariane 5 missile.
The main mirror of an infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the problems of the telescope is that it has to search for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest that there is ice on the South Pole of Mercurius.
However, there are no reliable data on this, as the Messinger is spinning closer to the North Pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades have indicated that there is ice on Mercuria.
Thanks to the messinger probe launched in 2004, the first one that spins around Mercurius, scientists are now certain of it.

A search for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
Traveling through the Talich Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
A booming minibus rolls on a swollen road past densely forested hills, turbulent streams, and simple farmhouses.
Everything is so green and bright, you can think you're in Schwartzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, and the Iranian border is just a few kilometers from here.
This is one of the peoples of the Kaukasus, one of whom is not much known, except that they speak well Farsi and Azeri and have longevity.
The end point is Lerick.
The small city is shattered by a too heavy architecture of Soviet times, which is not at all in harmony with the beautiful mountain landscape.
Travelers from Europe don't come here much, the road from the Azeri capital, Baku, is too tiring.
It takes eight hours for 323 km, since the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth to which the country owes the oil of the Caspian Sea, here, to the province, has not yet arrived.
However, Pilate Fatulayev (48) is convinced that there is much to interest tourists in.
"In May, Baku was famous for the Eurovision Song Festival -- and next year we're gonna have a festival of the world's oldest people," Fatulaeva says.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, probably the only one in the world.
There's a biography of about eight dots of pellets out of these places, over 100 years old, and Fatulaeva points to a black-and-white picture.
This is my grandpa, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child
But the controversial star of the Museum is the Chirali Muslumov Chaban, who is supposedly 168 years old.
There is, however, no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest man whose age is documented is 122 years old, the age of Muslumov is highly questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805, he died in 1973," Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, and at the age of 136, he had a daughter.
So, did the Chaban Muslums add a couple of tens of years to their age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher of age at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of longevity in Central Asia.
"A stunning number of people of old can also be found in some parts of China, Japan, or the Hongza Valley in Pakistan," Sholtz says, "in Sardinia too, there are very many very old people."
However, due to the lack of documentation, it was not possible to provide scientific proof of age, as there were no civil status records.
Every day a glass of hot butter
Still, there is a fact that people in the area of Lerik are astonishingly often reaching Bible age.
Now there are 20 people over the age of 100.
Why are there so many long livers here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide, Farid Mugimzadeh, explains this with the special genes of the waist.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, on the contrary, believes it's about food.
Tulls love meat, bread, and the most dairy foods, and many of them drink a cup of hot butter every day, but I don't think such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it about a primitive way of life that keeps people young?
At the age of 97, she was still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzaev, who claims to have 143 offspring, lives in a simple wooden house, typical of the entire Caucasian region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of butter, and she's not tired of driving around.
There are eight people under one roof, including one son and a daughter of Mirzaeva, who have long had grandchildren.
There's two kids in the neighborhood.
In the kitchen, the guests get a cup of tea that is served in the typical purple cups of the armood.
Mirzavoy has a perfect level and strong white teeth, under her headkerchief she hides the long, dark-blue braces her son is proud to open up to us.
I always wash my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"And I've never used shampoo," said Mirzaev.
A monthly pension is sufficient for a living
She always ate what grew up in her own courtyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought a grocery store in my entire life.
She then talks about her husband, who was in the army.
The hardest was after World War II.
But it was better when the "love father" Haydar Aliyev got to the helm.
Propaganda is not much in an old woman's speech.
But the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan has virtually no border.
He was in power until 2003, and his son Ilham took over.
There is, however, no poverty among the Azerbaijani elderly.
230 manats (about the same amount as the euro) Mirzaeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions it is a sum that can live well.
And perhaps the long-growing son of Mirzaeva is also right: "Old people in our culture have deep respect."
They live in a big family, loved, cared for, and happy.
What is no reason to stay alive for as long as possible?
The word “human right” is not in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo point to a deep division of the country.
The future constitution, based on the sharia, had met with a ferocity of repudiation.
The Egyptian president didn't sting for the phos.
We have to make a transition.
"And his success rests on my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on State TV.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all to Christian Cops, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly disunified in the disunified opposition, are in fear.
Fear of the religious state on the Nile on the mercy of the mighty Muslim Brothers.
Mohammed Mursi, almost apologizing, said that he had temporarily shortened the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competence to “save the revolution”.
But what really wants to save a 61-year-old engineer with a Ph.D. at the University of Southern California is not clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be devoid of power?
In fact, 234 articles have been swept in a 15-hour night leap with obstacles to an Islamist constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is in part a source of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the judicial process is based on the “principles of Islamic law”.
But what do you mean, "principles"?
This has been and is still a matter of interpretation, and it may be feared that Islamists will use the vague language and the resulting legal luuffle to interpret the sharia more strictly.
At least one new article suggests this: in all sharia-related cases, the Al-Ashar University Council, the country ' s most important Islamist institution, enjoys greater authority in all Sunni Islam.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy is in charge of the law, which would de facto result in the restriction of the judiciary.
Much in the draft constitution is a matter of interpretation
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians to a military court must be preserved.
These courts, during Mubarak ' s time, served to suppress the opponents.
Up to 11,000 civilians have been held in military detention since the dictator was demolished.
Also, as the draft states, the State must safeguard the “genuine nature of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values”.
This is so vague in legal terms that public institutions can, by means of this article, control even the content of the film and the literature.
In the open text, this means nothing but censoring.
No article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
The other one, however, forbids insulting and defaming the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished is not clear.
It was also questionable what was prohibited from “intimidating people”.
Will it be enough to caricature the president or to make a joke about the law school?
The question of interpretation, like much in this draft, which Mursi is proposing for a signature, which he said will be put to the Egyptians for a referendum very soon.
"The revolution has come back."
For a few weeks now, opposition to Islamist supremacy has been under way.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has come back, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who held the third position in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former head of the international Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, stated that the draft constitution was a place “in the dump of history”.
Through a short Twitter news service, he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a "putch against democracy."
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and cast it down," said the opponent, Yasser Said.
"We're not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been avenged," the Egyptian media quoted Khaled Ali's opposing policy.
Many of the judges also indicated that they did not want to follow the referendum, which would have rendered it null and void.
"The Koran is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but not at Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile to the University of Cairo.
It was attended by a large number of women under the veils and the Salafs, who yelled, "People demand the application of God's law."
They demanded Mursi to clean up the country, and they said, "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area on which it all began has led to a state of almost civil war.
The followers of Morsi obviously didn't want to take that risk.
Muslim Brothers stated that both the opponents and the supporters of the draft constitution spoke out loud and clear.
Now it is time to let the people decide in the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
Most for the Islamist project, it's considered a done deal.
"The concept of "human right" is never mentioned."
Hafiz Abu Sayeda is furious about this fortified constitutional process, which, in fact, was to last until February with the participation of all the public forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EPR) defended Muslim Brotherhood when in Mubarak they were either in prison or in court.
Not because he shared their world view, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this, he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
Now, the words "human rights" are never found in the new constitution, and he regrets talking to "Welt am Sonntag."
The expansion of Mursi's influence on all three branches of government in the State disappoints the lawyer.
These measures are clear blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“Aside from strengthening a civilian state, the President de facto abrogated it,” Saeda regrets.
After all, without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Sayeda senses that everyone has left it, even an international community that is looking at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mix of curiosity and tension.
This can be the payoff.
A protester on Tahrir Square warns, "You're creating a monster you can't control."
Norwegian Racfisk: The world's most bad-smelling fish?
The five-million Norwegian population has one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Perhaps the mystery of this country's success has something to do with the local addiction to one extremely stinky fish dish?
Take a few overripe bits of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You're gonna have a scenting scent of raqfic, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacy.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but there's an indestructible smell in the air.
Rackfisk is a trout filthed with salt and wandered in the water for a year, depending on what kind of sweet thing to do.
As the twilight converges and it's cold, a crowd of Norwegians are going to a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this very, let's say, exciting dish.
"She's got raw food and a drink of aquevite, a local black wodka," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter who runs the festival in his profession and part-time "Raqfic General."
Everywhere around us, people eat fish cut with small cubes and drink it with a lot of liquor.
"Someone likes aquavit rather than a raqfic," says Howard.
This drink can break the smell.
I'm trying a few bits.
If you can get a piece under your nose, it's not so bad, it's not much different from the sushi you've been on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a very different time, a time of poverty, when, even before the fridges, fish were soaked in hermetically closed barrels of salt water in the fall.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish was already well and well wet, it was extracted and diluted by the use of alcohol.
For the last generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country in search of a job and to emigrate mainly to the United States.
The population is now growing rapidly - more than 13 per cent of the population are immigrants, who are attracted to jobs, high wages and a well-developed social security system.
The people of Sweden (a long-time rival, not so long ago, and a much more lucrative neighbor) come to work here.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, an indistinguishable, though somewhat sinister, element of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, it's all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 (14 U.S.).
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and most of the country’s inhabitants seem to be content with this.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Bravik, a right-wing racist and extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is referred to as "the incident of 22 July".
It is very hard for the Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens has been able to commit such atrocities and killings.
Norway ' s current well-being stems from the growth (from the beginning of the 1970s) of one of the world ' s largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, diverging trays with used raffinise, a woman with long blonde hair, and astonishingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic well-being.
We are such a people, as you call it, a wise man.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks excellent English.
We don't like to show up, we don't brag.
Norway has been very careful with its oil, most of the oil and gas revenues being invested in a special fund set up for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when all the money they didn't had wasted, Norway was careful to count all the costs.
"As long as you can ski in winter and go camping in the summer, it's enough for you to be happy," Anna says.
"And there's a raqfic," she adds with a careless laugh.
I'm in the snow in line for some food. I'm done with the raqfish.
Here's a hamburger with salmon meat -- it's definitely an exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening, we have more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
My hotel hosts a special raqfic dinner, during which the best, or perhaps the most scenty, fish is determined by a vote.
There's a live TV show showing the host in a bow tie surrounded by dishes of raffinise.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Jürgen, what do you rate for the best fish there in your mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our score."...
Everybody laughs and applauds.
Someone falls off a chair, perhaps bypassing the aquavit.
Or maybe just inhaled with the smell of this fish.
President Henrique Peña Nieto of Mexico has a hard start in his career.
While the newly elected President of Mexico, Henrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the challenges he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's people.
Traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly bad state.
The city has been overloaded with transport at a better time, and steel fences have been erected since Monday, cutting down a number of key roads to the capital and causing traffic havoc.
But this was not to let people get to work from the suburbs, but to stop protesters from getting to the Parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Henrique Peña Nieto, will put on a presidential bandage and take over the country.
He's got a hard task ahead of him.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance in the administration of Felipe Calderón, which is now putting its responsibilities in place, but the country is in a war against drugs, which has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My Government declares to the people of Mexico its readiness to combat violence,” Mr. Peña Nieto earlier this week to US President Barack Obama in the White House Oval Office.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Peña Nieto ' s political career as governor of his home state of Mexico City was under way with the President of the United States.
In his home country, in a densely populated and vast state surrounding the country ' s capital, there was a disparate view of the new leader.
Direct man
In the idyllic city of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is reminiscent.
The people pay tribute to the revitalization of tourism, to the development of resorts and to the development of infrastructure.
One of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which is very different from those with booze and pits that were previously in the area, can be accessed.
There are placards with his name on the modern sports center building and on an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We have the hope of real and serious change with it,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a state Congressman from the Pianya Nieto Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so critically needed in our country, especially in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years in office, the PRI was replaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the Los Pinos Presidential Palace, the Party puts high hopes on Henrik Peña Nieto.
He also denies the accusations of indecency that the new President has been challenged by the opposition.
He is very direct and very committed to the realization of his country ' s vision for the future.
He's an excellent statesman, and above all, a man who can listen.
But in another part of the state, a lot of people have a different view of the former governor.
The city of Nesaualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nessa, is the most striking contrast to the moulded streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under motorways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the city are also the severity of this mega-cities.
Previously this year, troops had been recruited to quell drug gangs in those areas, and violence against women was particularly acute.
A number of dozens of bodies of murdered women have been found in the desert near a vast dump in the last two years alone.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during Mr. Peña Nieto ' s office of Governor, a figure much higher than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez, the name of which has become negative when it comes to the killing of innocent women.
According to Mr. Peña Nieto ' s opponents, he could at best be said to have been unable to deal with the problem of the killing of women during his term as Governor.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A resident of a concrete house, like most of the houses in this cluttered area, Irenaea Buendia has difficulty in holding her tears, showing me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of Mariana, she committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believed that her partner had killed her.
"When I got to her house, it was like her body was washed before," Mrs. Buendia remembers.
There were signs of her being beaten, and her body was already swollen.
Mariana's mother is recounting this story, and the picture of her daughter is looking at us from the wall, where he's hanging next to a crucifix, where there's only one word on it: justice.
This is what they said the family was denied.
"The state's officials treated me like an old gossiper, dissatisfied with an intruder of tranquillity.
They just want people to believe everything they say and keep quiet.
But it's wrong, it can't be, especially when there's so much wrong and wrong,” she says.
After wearing a presidential bandage on Saturday, President Peña Nieto will take on a difficult responsibility with her.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violence-related crimes, and the new President has promised to make the problem a priority during his reign.
"I hope he'll be the same president as the governor," says Olvera, Congressman of Valle de Bravo from the PRI.
But this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Nessa fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain of any ill-treatment, states the charge.
The prosecution is trying to disprove Bradley Manning's allegations of poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning ' s stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence requires the case to be closed on the ground that Manning's conditions of detention were brutal.
The U.S. Army has been charged with theft of thousands of classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who was accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, had not availed himself of a lot of opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he said he had been put on hold in a military prison.
During cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Mede, Maryland, the Military Prosecutor, Major Ashden Feyn, stated that the records of the weekly visits to Manning by the prison authorities for nine months in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain any complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of the Defence motion to discontinue Manning ' s case, on the basis that the conditions of his detention were brutal and in themselves a sufficient punishment, was carried out the day after Manning stated that he had been in custody and had intended to commit suicide.
The Military Intelligence Analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is charged with theft of several thousand secret documents while in Iraq.
The material was later published on the WikiLeaks Web site.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During the Friday hearing, Prosecutor Fain, together with Manning, reviewed the reports that had been completed after Manning ' s visits to the administration during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was in strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, the prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When D.A. Feyn asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he viewed the application of the prison administration as “excellent” and the general conditions of detention as “very professionally organized”.
The reports reviewed do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite the fact that Manning was directly asked about the conditions of his detention, Pheine argues.
Manning replied that he had expressed his oral concern about the problems and that the officials who had visited had discussed the problems with him and had stated that they would do so, but had not recorded it in writing.
"They've been recording "no problem" (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't bring it up in a conversation," Manning says.
The Military Judge, Colonel Denise Lindh, also asked Manning why he had not complained of the ill-treatment he had received in January 2011 during a meeting of a commission considering the suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that session, he wanted to be removed from the “injury warning” regime and eased the conditions of detention.
The military authorities explained that the restricted regime of detention, at a level lower than the surveillance regime for the prevention of suicide, had been put in place to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know I'm okay with them to end the injury prevention regime... so that my standard of living would improve, from my point of view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to a prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had the idea of a suicide in Kuwait, and that one day he had lost consciousness due to the heat.
He explained that it's very psychologically hard when you don't get to know how your fate is handled, and what's going on in the outside world.
"My world has succumbed to Camp Arifjan's base, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I was gonna die in this cage."
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day - all alone.
Manning reports that he was only allowed to leave a mattress, a blanket, a slab, a few items of clothing, and a pair of glasses.
He says he was trying to move, as sleeping or even just lying down during the daytime prohibited the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he was constantly hit by a light that penetrates the outside of the cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he was in bed at night, he said he was waken up and forced to turn on his back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection to Manning's ill-treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Levenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge interrogated Manning about the statement he made during his statement on Thursday that, after he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners during the morning check.
Manning said he couldn't cover up with a blanket at the time of the check.
In response to the judge ' s questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard ' s order that he should leave a blanket to cover for, but admitted that no one had ordered him to leave.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he was trying to show an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer he could have used a slipper or a slipper to hurt himself, but he didn't do it.
That night, according to Manning's statement, his underwear, his slippers, and his sunglasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had to endure during his detention, and would substantially shorten the sentence if Manning was found guilty by a military court, which was to start his trial early next year.
The defence stated that it was planning to invite Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes, while the other charges were to be challenged as superfluous.
The re-opening of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon states that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of persons under the strictest conditions.
The charges brought against Manning include aiding an adversary, illegal promotion of the Internet, the transfer of information on national defence, and the theft of State property or documents.
If he is convicted of all counts, he may face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican origin.
In the author ' s view, many Mexicans had to leave Mexico for lack of opportunities to implement themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are rife between two cultures.
During a recent visit to Mexico City, I walked down the incoming hallway, approached the border control zone and froze on the ground.
The labels were in two queues: one for Mexicanos, the other for Extranjeros.
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and they used to call me a Mexican.
It's just a conditional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York think they're Italian.
Later, I focused on the complex design of "American of Mexican origin."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandpa's country, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than my language, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I got my American passport, and I got in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected President of Mexico, Henrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The issues of immigration, drugs and trade that were common to the Presidents of those countries were on the agenda.
President Peña Nieto was willing to talk about the recovery of the Mexican economy, which would make it possible for the Mexicans to stay in Mexico as well, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the US and Canada and to set up a North American trade block like the EU.
In addition, President Peña Nieto has promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals have been made.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is a grave and old-fashioned matter.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and, at gunpoint, forced its leaders to give up half of their territory.
But the Mexicans have been thinking for centuries, not for minutes, and they see reminders of all the events.
So it's only for any U.S. stateman to bring a word of criticism to Mexico, to the press, and to the elite of Mexican society at once complaining that Americans are infringing on the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the descendants of Montezuma are filled with war.
The most complex, however, are Mexico’s relations with over 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about resentment?
That's enough.
There are victors and losers in Mexico, people who find themselves in this country, and those who do not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, there are so many people of Mexican origin, for one reason only: at some point in their family history, no one, either a father or a granddad, was able to implement themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.
Most of the time, they were Mexicans of a certain type - black, uneducated, from poor peasant families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
In Mexico, it's not the way it is.
Today, our life is the embodiment of an American dream, we've been in good schools and we've got a job, but we can't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is complicated and unclear, but we know which country to think it is.
United States of America.
We also know that most members of the Mexican elite and the ruling class don't like us.
We say the same to them.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats, and they treat us as second-class people, as non-exact Mexicans.
We don't speak very well in Spanish, and our relations with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind a silk curtain now, finding a full life in the United States, but losing our spiritual connection.
My wife was born in Guadalajara, and she legally moved to the United States when she was a kid, and this reminds me that there are some tensions between real Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin, and Mexicans are more aware of their national identity, and Americans of Mexican origin are more offended.
She's a U.S. national, and she thinks she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances, who are of Mexican origin, do not feel that they belong to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigers del Norte, but we love Bruce Springsteen.
By getting the best of the two worlds, you're bound to lose your roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, they call us Mexicans.
Now, as I found out on my trip, as if our relationship was already not complicated enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to re-enter their relations with the Diaspora.
They want the Americans of Mexican origin to work as Mexican ambassadors and represent her in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to fortify ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
It's not gonna work.
Too much resentment in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, the spread of corruption and the drug trade, many of us do not think this country is so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but deal with this on your own, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican origin are still offended by the way their relatives have been treated most recently in Mexico.
Yeah.
I think we have more in common than I thought.
Old Wars in the New Middle East
A ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas faction can be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East possible?
Another round of bloodshed has led to the conclusion that such hopes are in vain.
It has become a common, pointless argument about who began; a host of buildings have been turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, the majority of whom were civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time in the conflict, rockets from the Gaza Strip have fallen in the vicinity of the capital of Israel, Tel-Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But despite the hopeless links between Israelis and Palestinians in their perpetual conflict, the Middle East has been reshaped.
This can be viewed in a different way, but the events of the Arab Spring have swirled in a mutiny storm with many well-established realities, and the Palestinians and the Israelis have not been able to stay away from the whirlwind that has shaken the region.
Perhaps, as a result, their struggle will become even more bloodthirsty than ever before.
There are, however, reasons for hope of overcoming this fatal impasse.
A War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire, which was signed on 21 November, is being implemented, the fighting this week has only reinforced the positions of the militants on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas Islamist movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will claim to have forced Israel to retreat despite the loss they have suffered.
Despite the fact that some faction leaders have been destroyed and 1.7 million people have been blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled parts of the world, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is growing in popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements grows in the Arab world, Hamas has new powerful and rich friends.
The renaissance of the regional leader of Turkey, who once was Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, has been supporting Hamas; her example has been followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic States in the Persian Gulf.
The glorified supporters of Hamas have claimed the creation of an Islamist semi-month around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, in which the warring Hezbollah is operating, to Syria, where the increasingly pro-Islamic rebels are about to overthrow Bashar Assad’s power, and further to Jordan, where the king’s authorities threaten Hamas allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region has taken place on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood has been strengthened under President Mohammed Mursi.
Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled Egypt for 30 years and was demolished in 2011, was a secular dictator with little focus on the support of Hamas.
The Muslim brothers, on the other hand, are an organization much like Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic positions, Hamas can become a meaningful player whose voice will not be stifled even by Israel and America.
At the same time, the hardline in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli anti-missile system, the Iron Dome, has justified the cost of its creation and has successfully destroyed many of the rockets launched by Hamas.
Israelis can sleep quietly, at least for a while.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the US has remained steadfast; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for launching the last round of violence.
Another important factor is Israel ' s economic prosperity, especially under the Government of Binyamin Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that, since 2004, some 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has been able to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through the wall that enters the West Bank of the Jordan River, a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian State, and to protect the Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions under international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, in preparation for the 22 January elections, has joined with even more aggressive conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What's the point of permissing the Palestinians and giving them a State of their own?
If they hand over all the authority in the West Bank, wouldn't they start launching rockets from there towards Israel, as their brothers do in the Gaza Strip?
It's best to keep them out of the wall and stifle any attempt to lift their heads.
Proponents of the hardline may win; however, their calculations can be disproved in the Arab spring.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defensive part of Israel's budget is greater than all of its Arab neighbours combined.
The outbreak of war with a regional super-Power is not likely to help Arab Governments to strengthen their economies.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Mursi, who worked with Barack Obama on a cease-fire is a good sign and can mark the beginning of a change.
Israel, to the same extent, must bear in mind the long-term consequences of its policies.
As the democratic changes in the Arab countries erupted, depriving the Palestinians of the right to self-determination was a time bomb that would eventually explode in the occupied territories of Israel, like a bus that had been blown up in Tel-Aviv this week.
Repressions are already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic dimension, the growth of the Arab population, is only exacerbating these problems.
The bloodthirsty operations that take place every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement have to be paid by the international community ' s growing discontent.
Both sides need an external impulse.
The only solution that is unrelentingly called for by sound representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our paper, is the formation of two States and Israel ' s transfer of territories in return for security.
The hope remains, not too strong in the short term, that a cease-fire will enable other countries to have a more effective impact on the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which has a long time to make a decision to cut off arms to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, has a more lucrative position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the boundaries of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the shared use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
That would do more for the creation of a Palestinian State than the upcoming United Nations vote, which could result in a recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama has a role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, he still failed to submit his own peace plan.
Upon his return to the White House, he continued to show a reluctance to join the problem.
This is a catastrophic short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The Unified Packing Act for Cigarettes has entered into force in Australia.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and the images of sick body parts are contrasted with the depressing green boxes, which are the same for all cigarette stamps.
The first Australian law on the same-type packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products has come into force in the world, replacing the logos and colored design of the various stamps with a box of depressing olyfolk with depressing images of sick body parts and images of children whose health is affected by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to the various images and inscriptions that warn of the harm of smoking, the only difference between packs that are mandatory from this Saturday is stamp names, which are printed in the same small font.
These are the world's most stringent conditions for the packaging of tobacco.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving them of this harmful fashion habit.
The solution was based on research that showed that people who have not started to smoke before the age of 26 in 99 out of 100 do not ever become smokers.
“It is clear that even at the youngest age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to communicate by packing,” explains the Minister of Health, Tanya Plybersek, referring to studies that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess.
Australia was one of the countries with the world ' s lowest share of smokers, so that the changes would not have a major impact on the profit of transnational corporations, but other countries were already considering such measures.
The tobacco industry has been strongly opposed to the adoption of the Act.
The tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will have serious consequences, different from what the initiators thought it would have", Scott McIntyre, a British American Tobacco agent in Australia.
Forged producers from China and Indonesia will deliver much more such items for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the other hand, new laws help to grow business.
Sandra Ha, from a small family company, Zico Import Pty Ltd, states that the demand for cigarettes and silicon casings concealing unwelcome images on the package has grown rapidly (practically from zero) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris, and Japan Tobacco lost the case in Australia's High Court, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold some 6,000 items to the bulk trade and is waiting for a new shipment.
It's a good business for us.
In the view of the experts, the popularity of social media among the target population is a potential barrier to the effectiveness of such measures.
After a number of laws have been enacted in Australia that have made illegal television advertising and support for sporting events, as well as bans on the display of cigarettes in the public domain, the advertising of tobacco has been made available on the Internet.
The Australian Government has banned local companies and websites from posting ads on the Internet, but it cannot limit it to foreign websites.
"If you're selling tobacco and you've only got this little loophole left, the idea of moving your product on the Internet would seem very tempting to you," explains Becky Freeman, a student of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noted an increase in the number of brand reviews written on behalf of allegedly common users on social media such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook.
The question is, is it a private citizen who loves Marlboro's cigarettes so much that he's spared his energy and time and made a video, or is it the advertising company behind it?
British American Tobacco, Australia, states that the industry is now more engaged in adapting to new rules than in advertising.
The tobacco industry has even resorted to such measures as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these States are making claims in the context of the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfairly restricted, even though the trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very small.
The decision of the WTO is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plybersek, the Government has been discussing with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce mandatory photographs to warn against the dangers of smoking.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering the possibility of stricter laws.
A number of smokers in Australia have been disobedient to new developments.
These images don't bother me.
I just don't mind.
"Just grab a cigarette and put a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor on a pack.
To be fair, the only thing that can make me quit is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the tobacco shop, King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, claims that the same package has made it more difficult to place the goods on the shelves.
"I used to have an hour to unload the new shipment, and now it's four hours," he complains.
"The government should have taken and completely banned the cigarettes, "we'd have said, "what to do, okay, it's over, we're shutting down the shop," he says, "and he's putting his hands up.
Missing in a world of e-networks and constant connection is not so bad.
On this Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane had mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane we were waiting for.
So I've had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and it's not gonna be much of a book or a magazine or an iPhone or even a duty-free shop.
Recently, however, more and more scientists and professionals in child development have been expressing themselves in favour of boredom.
They say that in certain situations it is not so bad for us and for our children to miss.
This has led the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may be a source of creativity.
And since in today's world, we're all always in front of a screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Maybe we need to try to get bored.
Yeah.
And at the same time, no.
We'll get back to it.
I used to think, like many, that boredom was an invention of a relatively recent time when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, a professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University of Canada, author of the book Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact, boredom can brag about a very old history," he says.
The walls of Pompeii have Latin textbooks of boredom from the first century.
The question of how we understand boredom is still open.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying the research on the subject and asking a question to a task force of 100, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have come to the following definition: boredom is when people “want to do but cannot do what pleases them”.
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored man doesn't do something he'd like to do.
I don't want to do anything when I'm apathy.
The main thing in the boredom, he says, is "disobedientness and the resulting deterioration of the mood and the sense of slowness of time."
The description of boredom may seem very depressing.
But Professor Eastwood states that, despite the possible connection between these states, bored people see the causes of the problems in the world and the circumstances, and depressed people see the problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's just hard to focus on something.
Professor Eastwood and his co-workers refer to a previous experiment, in a September issue of the Journal of Perspectives on Psychological Science.
Some participants also heard the sound of a non-essential TV program in the next room, others heard the same sound on low volume, so that it was barely possible to sort it out, and a third group listened to only a voice recording without an extraneous sound track.
The participants who heard the low-volume TV said they were bored, more often than others - it was hard for them to focus, but they didn't know the reason for it, and they attributed it to the boredom.
When we're trying to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an adjunct professor of neurology at Gwelph University, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something not interesting, "e.g. by looking at the stream of goods on the conway in the search for a marriage, distracting music can help to avoid boredom."
It goes on to say that when people start rocking on a chair or drawing caracules on a piece of paper, they do it from boredom, but now we know that, in fact, such actions just help not to relax physically.
"The study has shown that children who are not prevented from grouching and spinning learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit down," states Professor Fenske.
At some point, we all get bored, with the delay of the flight (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching a non-interessant movie.
However, different people show a different degree of boredom.
In the 1980s, to measure such individual features, researchers developed a special “smart-to-smart scale”.
To measure on such a scale, questions and statements are used, such as, "Many of what I have to do is monotonous and monotonous" or "I'm too interested, so I don't have time for anything."
Using such questionnaires, researchers have found that boys miss more girls, - Stephen Odovic, Professor of Psychology at the University of Western Florida - especially with a wide range of external irritants.
In general, however, teenagers are often bored.
In 1991 Reid Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment, in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day with a pager.
He obtained the following results: 32 per cent of the teenagers said they were bored in school and during their homework, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside of school.
Only 3% of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson points out that he has no information on what such data would be about boredom now, 21 years later.
But he knows that "youth has a peak in a tendency to get bored," mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do with it.
Let's go back to my original question: is boredom good?
Sometimes not, because in extremes, research has shown that it can push people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling, or substance abuse in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have been thinking about the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor Odovic, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"So our brain tells us to do something else; this is boredom," says Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But this very brain does not always know what to do.
If you're bored and you're going to put that energy on a guitar game or a culinary experiment, you're going to do better.
But if you start watching TV, you'll only get better for a while, and it'll be over soon.
So, if your kid misses and you give him an iPad, he'll stop missing, but he won't learn to deal with boredom on his own or in any other way to control his time and employment,” Professor Fenske says.
"And such self-regulatory skills are used in a wide range of situations," he states.
Your kid learns not only to be self-conscious, he learns to be self-conscious at all.
I don't think there's any way to exorcise boredom.
But it's not a bad thing to think of either.
Rather, we need to learn to feel comfortable even beyond the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"We see it in such a way that we need to get bored more often, while boredom is an extremely unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to get out of their constant cares and just to relax.
"In today's world, we're used to the constant overstimulation of the senses," he says, "and when there's silence, we get lost and we don't know what to do."
So far, it is not clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado will be applied.
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football player and a student at a social college in the south-eastern state of Colorado, has been charged with a criminal offence that will soon be completely legal throughout the state: the storage of a small pot of marijuana and the tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosko said that he and his friends were once in September in Lamar and in a car in the prairie near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped by the police.
After a policeman found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco was summoned to court for possession of drugs and possession of a device for the use of drugs - minor offences, each of which was subject to a fine of $100 - and a court date was set.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has lasted a few weeks after the state of Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small amounts for entertainment, hundreds of small court cases depend not so much on the law as on the place to be heard.
Charges for minor marijuana-related offences have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, D.C., which has taken a similar action.
Police stations have already ceased to press charges against people 21 years of age and over for possessing small dosages, which will become legal as soon as the law enters into force in a couple of weeks.
In the more conservative Colorado districts, however, the prosecutors have decided to deal with existing marijuana cases and continue to hold the drug responsible.
At the same time, in some cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the West Mountains, there is a vote to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops from becoming available.
"All this is developing so fast, I don't even know what to expect next," says Daniel J. Outs, the police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Members of the State of Washington control agencies are also puzzled to shav their heads.
They will have to draw up rules to determine the manner in which to license the production, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, all of which should be done by 1 December 2013.
They say Colorado, good or bad, outpaces most of the other states in dealing with the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado, a more orderly market, so it will serve as a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, a representative of the Board for the Regulation of the Production and Sale of Alcohol in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits, than put forward some suggestions and hope that it will work.
"We don't have a real precedent to focus on," he says.
The Washington State Bill, named I-502, will come into force on 6 December and will put the state in a state of uncertainty for a year when there is no State license system and the right to own marijuana has been legalized.
And there are still complex technical aspects to be addressed in this period, for example, how to strike a balance between the state's “adequate access” to licensed marijuana with a ban on trade in it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds, and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana businesses in urban areas, in particular in and out of Seattle”, explains Ben Livingstone, a representative of the recently created research group, the “Centre for Legalization of Marijuana”.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police of Oates of Aurora sent an e-mail message to his subordinates that the City's Public Prosecutor's Office would no longer hold persons who had reached the age of 21 for a small amount of marijuana, and that the police would stop incriminating people of the violations “from now on”.
The Chief of Police, Oates, indicated that the police would monitor compliance in the city with the rules governing the activities of those who cultivated marijuana for medical purposes, and would prosecute illegal drug traffickers and dealers.
The Weld County Prosecutor in North Colorado, Ken Buck, presents a stricter approach to this issue.
After a vote on the bill, he stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office would continue to prosecute the possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage users to receive treatment.
At the moment, 119 persons have been charged with the possession of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them are also charged with other violations.
“The duty of our institution to prosecute for acts that are considered to be criminal at the time of their commission,” Mr. Buck said in his statement.
The response was mixed even in places such as the Mesa village, where the voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the county, no longer prosecutes adults for possessing a small amount of drugs.
The D.A. Pete Hoetzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to drop the charges in the pending marijuana cases.
"I think it's our direct duty to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55 per cent of the people in Colorado who voted supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the State and the legal system will not be easy.
And the conflicting reaction of the people in the state has revealed ambiguities in the attitude of the local authorities to the state's marijuana experiment.
“The District Public Prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this regard,” explains Sean McAlister, a Denver lawyer representing convicted marijuana, and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of the Laws on Harbour.
"They've been persecuting people for so long, they can't really live up to the fact that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to treat a small amount of marijuana the same way they treat alcohol, are meant to be a country-wide experimental field to test the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Proponents of legalization and state officials are planning to expand the legalized trade, but at the same time they are looking for instructions from the federal authorities, who are still planning to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will give up on this matter.
Despite several high-profile arrests of drug dealers and patients who used marijuana on medical grounds, the federal Government has in most cases approved the trade in marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington, D.C., and 16 other states.
Agents of the DEA are unlikely to invade their homes to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are not likely to close their eyes to state-regulated recreational marijuana shops, which are authorized by the new law, Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug adviser in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the federal authorities to do so.
Even before the presidential elections, some local governments had approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana shops, which would not have been able to open before a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in such a position as to give someone a license, and then it's gonna cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Peterella Wyatt: I was left of Oxford for being a conservative.
The harassment of university students for their views has not begun today.
As long as I can remember, I've always wanted to go to Oxford.
My dad and my older brother went to Oxford and described it as the world's best educational institution, a modern analogy to an antique symposium that lays down the two pillars of civilization: freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, at the University of Oxford University School of History, in the late '80s, I packed up my bags and left, which was the first real scandal in my life.
My dad couldn't stand it and weeped.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed I quit school because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from squirt cups.
Actually, it wasn't that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically molested and bullied.
Not because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I was in private school.
I was poisoned for one reason, and in this glorified cradle of enlightenment, it was a real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known counselor, Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the conservatives.
You're gonna ask, why do you have to think about it now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students with a right-wing mindset is subject to the same kind of harassment.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that accorded to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from a student club at the Christie Corps College in Cambridge state that they are “frequently insulated, personally assaulted and made to feel unwelcome” because of their political views.
They want to add an additional representative to the College ' s Equal Rights Committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was further exacerbated by the recent BBC 2 documentary on student politics, "The Land of Wonders: Young, Smart, and Right", in which the conservatives were described as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, who drives the Rolls Road, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver stick.
In other universities, conservative students complain of being made of them as “a scapegoats for raising school fees”.
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservatives Association, in an interview with a Sunday newspaper, said that "in the university environment, there is an increasing bias towards the left.
People who don't even know us think we're predetermined and violent children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student in the history school of the Christie Corps, in which a request for enhanced protection was made, calls such an atmosphere "uncomfortable," while Stephanie Cheryl, 19-year-old, the new president of the Oxford University Association of Conservatives, says that the attitude of the student club towards the right-wing centerers has significantly deteriorated.
"This is a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the normal life of the members of the club," she says.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I was not just a minority, I was alone.
I got there in September 1986, a timid and shy 18 - year - old girl.
Oxford fevered from hating the conservative party.
A year earlier, the University had by vote deprived the former student, Margaret Thatcher, of her honorary status due to a reduction in the budget for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of a freshman's week, when the students met each other and the teachers, I first felt what was ahead of me.
I didn't know that the teachers didn't just look through their fingers at the harassment of the Conservative students, but I was also happy to be there.
The political issues - the miners' strike, the privatisation and the Government's opposition to the imposition of sanctions against the South African Government of Apartheid - have penetrated through the wooden wall of the audiences.
At my first seminar, I needed to translate the 18th-century French text into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Mrs. Wyatt," said the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was hard for me, and I stuttered.
Harry Pitt was a very gallant man with a face like a cake.
"The Tatchers don't teach French in principle, or do they just need brains?" he asked.
The other students intrigued.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take a few fresh French classes in your spare time, if you're not very busy spinning around," Pitt.
I went back to my room completely miserable.
That night in college, I sat alone at lunch, and then someone slapped me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from English, who introduced himself as a member of the University Conservatives Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
Anyone who is suspected of being sympathizers will be bullied.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know your dad's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most of the first-year conservatives pretend to be laborers."
Later, in a local pub, I lazyly tried to hypocrite.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick didn't work out.
A first-year student in the Department of Philosophy, Policy and Economics, who himself studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students picked up on what he said.
I was spoiled, filthy.
"How do the Conservatives have sex?", asked one of them.
- They're kicking each other, aren't they?"
I felt like I was supposed to be gay before the criminal prosecution was over in the 1960s.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet my fellow humans under cover of the night?
Will I be forced to become a laborer and to conceal my true beliefs?
The coming three years began to look like hell full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who didn't hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a conservator, but also for being a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her speechwriters.
He didn't show up in college.
He hated him for his provinciality, triviality, and commitment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997 he took up a post of Professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I started to go to Oxford from my parents' home in London, trying to find a place of refuge among family and open - minded metropolitan friends.
I told my dad I hated Oxford and I explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the 1940s, any political opinion was adopted.
"But this is the best university in the world," he lamented.
- There's no way to do this, not in a city of sleepy spikes...
Even my comunist friends have always been impeccable."
His wet eyes are swollen.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you leave the university."
I was tired of a permanent trip to London, and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, also a conservative, failed to withstand pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The following week, during a seminar, when another history teacher really called me "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In the shower, burning with shame, I confessed, "I've been brainwashed by my parents," and I called them "old fools."
It was a short break.
The last nail on the cover of my career coffin in Oxford was meant to kill my dad.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for Rupert Murdock ' s publications.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and five minutes later, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed a bag and got on the first train to London.
I never got back.
You can call me a cripple and a rag.
But at the age of 18, no one should be the object of such anger and intimidation in a school.
The sadder it was, Oxford, who not only released the 14 Tory prime ministers, but still conceals himself behind the unserviceable image of a university that values equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentine favors the elegance of fame."
ABC is talking to Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica, and other prominent Italian designers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital to receive an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer admitted this at the time of the opening of Valentino: The Sewing Master, a triumphal retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high-mode dresses created by his "home" for the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
The exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "or signor" Harvani, but it could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino always felt enchanted by the rare and far-off world to know.
In the first room of this exhibition, open up to March 3, there are personal letters and photographs signed by the most prominent aristocrats, from Princess Salima Agha Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Mary Chantal, the Princess of Greece, and Margaret, the Princess of Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophy of his social uplift, from a humble tailor from Vogera in the north of Italy to the idol of the international elita.
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong with it.
"They don't even clean up their cigarettes on your gorgeous rug, like some beautiful stars of pop music do," says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemica.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is an excellent host and hosts with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to come to his chalet in Gstaad," explains Tissen's ex-wife, a close friend of forgotten pretty ladies like Marella Angelly or Eugenia Niarhos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of glory.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, remembers a charismatic modeler.
One day we went to his house to have dinner, it was after a fashion show at the Spanish Square in Rome, many years ago.
Among the 20 invitees were Sharon Stone and John JFK Jr.
Valentino's style was in every detail in his apartment, in her dress, in her food, in his music.
"Everyone of Valentino's guests made him feel important and loved," he says, "the "top model", which began working with a designer in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He's never out of fashion, because his designs are real works of art," she finishes.
Analogic parade
Harvani's life is not a history of obsession, it's a history of love with complete reciprocation.
He likes people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House Gallery has been transformed into a glamorous runway of 60 meters in length, which offers a change of roles: a visitor takes the place of the model and has to defile on the runway, staring at "visits" from a dream that glistens with Valentino's masterpieces, such as a dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a suit that was used by Monica Vitty in "Neigh", or a coat of wool and skin that belonged to the emperor Fara Dib.
Names such as Sybilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Tourn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria, or Sofia Habsburg, are glamorous in this public.
Nati Abascal and Designer, 2006
A lot of these clients say Valentino's first is like the first love, "you can't forget."
I remember it well.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest, and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Nati Abascal, one of the designers' muse.
"I prefer him to the others for his feminineness, for his love for women, because he highlights our beauty," adds the former duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he's using, they have a lot of light in them, and they're coming up on his face.
The ratio is perfect.
The Princess and fashion-legislator of Patricia della Jovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she was dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and I lived in Italy, I dreamed I'd have an age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
At last, the time came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to put it on at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a rind-shaped skirt, "shopping" in a shrapnel and a cut without a wire.
"It was a dream come true," said the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is extraordinarily," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York, and Buenos Aires.
"Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday dresses from a modeler with "maximum care... 'because dress is not just a dress, it's also a set of memories to accompany him."
Fashion King
The grand finale of the exhibit at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-chantal Miller for her wedding with Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls her sewing) to make this dress out of ivory-coloured silk with pearls, 12 species of different laces, and a four-and-a-half-metre plume.
According to the journalist Susie Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, the dress is a milestone in the late 20th century, "the return of the highest-world clients."
Overwhelmed by the "study of life" of the Elite for many years, Valentino is now her best representative.
The Grand Cross Cavalry (sign of the highest rank in Italy), the Labour Cavalry, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Speech, awarded by the Order of the Legion of Honour, Garavani has gathered as much honor as any of his clients.
"Always my attention has been drawn to his serenity, his tranquillity, his timid and impeccable appearance," recalls Dr. Arenberg.
Last I saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orse Museum.
He was sitting at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was unblemished, time doesn't exist for him."
If that's what the princess is saying...
The hardest profession in the world: miners from Kawah Ijena
For four Euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kg of sulfur to the top of a volcano on a steep rocky path.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living from a sulfur mine in the island of Kawah Ijen, in the eastern part of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto goes down to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfurous gas from the depths of the Earth freezes in contact with the air.
He puts the large pieces of sulfur up to 70 kg in two bamboo baskets, puts the baskets on his shoulders, and carries them up on a rocky road.
Up to the top of a volcano of 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but it takes the exhausted porters for more than 40 minutes to climb up with a turtle step, with difficulty to keep the balance and tore the road down carefully so as not to fall or fall off a cliff.
They know that one wrong move can cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the rocks of Kawah Ijen a few years ago.
The miners from Cavah Ijen make five eurocents for every kg of sulphur they produce.
Upstairs, they lay the road between the tourists who photographed them, as if they were circus apes and, with their heavy baskets up to three kilometers to the balance that the mining company has set up a bit higher, at a height of 1,850 meters.
This is the PT Candy Ngrimby, a company that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, best and best not to say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for Rs. 10,000 (83 Eurocents) to petrochemical production, for this mineral is common in daily life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"Because the norm is 70 kg, we make about Rs. 46,000 (Euro3.8) for every move," explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily transfers.
He spends three hours on each one of them, and at the end of the day he feels crushed, but they allow him to save Rs. 138,000 (Euro1.5) by the end of the day.
Although it seems a miser for such an unhuman effort, it is three times as much as he would have made in the field.
“The daily wage for miners is very high in local terms, where the price of the coffee is Rs. 15,000 (Euro1.2) per day, and the average monthly wage is Rs. 2 million (Euro167),” explains a porter who used to work as a rocker on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was Rs. 75,000 (Euro6.2) per day and the plot was not as heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Bnuwanga, a town near the volcano, for a reason that in Indonesia is as devastating as the sera: "I married a girl from Bali, where there are Hindus, and brought her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto asthma, he's breathing hard, coughing all the time, and he's gonna get his eyes up because of the toxic gas.
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kavah Igen, whose sulfur has already begun to affect him, despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's gonna get his eyes up because of the toxic gases that emit the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to make his dream come true.
"I'll work for another two years, 'cause I want to open a shop or study a Spanish or a French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punited by life, this sweet and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter, or a hotel porter, but instead he's doing a mule job.
The deluxe of a filthy wooden hut with other porters, it wakes up every day at 2:00 a.m., because the sulfur never stops running out at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glitters in the middle of the darkness.
Calling out the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater, lighting his way with a small light, connected to his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
Some 400 porters are carrying baskets of grey on their shoulders from the bottom of a volcano.
Despite the high returns, the mining company has not mechanized the production of sulfur to save the cost, nor has it provided any equipment to porters who work on their own account and with such hardships.
In fact, they do not even receive a part of Rs. 30,000 (Euro2.5) of the photography fee, which, together with an entry card for Rs. 15,000 (Euro1.2), the guards of this reserve are charging tourists to take a picture of the volcano and its mullel men.
“This is a work for livestock, not for humans,” states Badrusin, a 42-year-old root porter who has spent three decades in Cavah Ijen since he left college.
He's able to raise to 110 kilos, and he says he's going to be able to take the job "as long as he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
If I don't retire, I'm gonna die here, 'cause a volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so patient that no one complains of their severe diseases... more serious, apparently than their common problems with breath, arthrosis, knee pains and ulcers on their shoulders, which have been deformed under the weight of the basket.
By balancing the basket on his back, the Unainik can now only raise 50 pounds in his 53 ’ s.
Every day, he and his companions take 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks are transporting to a warehouse in Tamansari, traveling 18 km on a narrow path in the woods.
"I'm not gonna retire, I'm gonna die here, 'cause a volcano is my whole life," says Unaignicus, wide opening his mouth with a few teeth short.
Of his five children, an older man, 30 years old, he also works as a sulfur vector.
Time is running out, but poverty permeates one of the hardest things in the world: what human mules do from Kawah Ijena.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress, and the cost of housing and education for the absence of children.
"The people of Singapore need to grow."
I'm a patriot's husband, you're a patriot's wife, we'll do our civic duty and make life!
It may seem improbable that these strings are part of an ad for mint cakes, but even though this, or perhaps because of it, this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local proverbs like "Let's put a bao in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising agency that made the video, BBH, is hoping that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in an entertaining way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do their national duty.
This thing is just for the Internet, so we needed to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce our own kind, so we sensed that this was the subject we should address.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, for example, run spirits with pheromones or set up quick dating parties (blitz whiskers).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, which is to make a rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not take it so lightly are the Singapore Government.
It spends 1,300 US dollars a year on policy to inspire citizens to have more children.
The State package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extension of maternity leave and tax relief.
But all of this has a low level of efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leadership and its strict public control.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its National Population Authority, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was less than 2 - what is known as the rate of substitution - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more kids?
Tan Wei Min, director of the Office of Family and Family Policy of the National Population Office, says that the reason for the “improved education” and “the wider range of career opportunities”.
"This has made it possible for people to have a wider range of options in terms of life's goals and priorities, in addition to weddings and family-building," she explains.
These changes in social norms have led to an increase in the number of singles and the postponement of marriage and the birth of children, which has led to a decline in Singapore ' s birth rate.
In the meantime, immigration policies, which aim at a sharp increase in immigration to counter the decline in the population, are indignant among the local population.
Singapore has a web site where there is a narrowly hidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping their wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons for Singapore ' s ruling party ' s worst performance in elections since independence last year.
After the elections, there was an attempt to address the problem, with quotas and higher taxes on foreign workers.
Unexpected Effect
While the fall in fertility has a significant impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, health and immigration spending, Singapore’s example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government was making an effort not to build so much small housing.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development manual has moved on to monitoring the number of small apartments, known as a "shoe box", which can be built in certain parts of the city.
This 46-square-metre apartment is very good for sale.
Still, there is a view that they can contribute to a single life and discourage developers who want to build a big family home.
But Lim Yu Sun, the CEO of the EL Developers, says that their "shoeboxes" are sold much faster than more spacious copies.
They're more popular, in the sense that such apartments buy out for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash earnings are increasing.
However, he recognized that the new rules provided clearer guidance to the developers who had previously been prevented if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too overstretched
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules can be a step towards an increase in national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the center, they do not seem to have much effect.
"People are very overstretched, housing is expensive, as is education, and so many people put it off," says the young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important to me to have my own money and time," another young man is 20 years old.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and the cost of housing and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government is trying to encourage its citizens to have their children, as far as childbirth is concerned, the last word is for the Singaporeans.
Personal offline - private online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish, this is a private or “sphere of private life, which has the right to be protected from any interference”.
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in social media?
Does he understand the dangers of Internet discussions that would certainly not be shared outside the Internet?
ElPeriódico interviewed five kids between the ages of 10 and 15, who are frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine," in a private way, and "password and user's name" when they applied it to social media.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't upload to the post," says Jorge, a 10-year-old, when he's trying to explain the meaning of personal on Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had records for two years.
"It's a very secret, my mom may know it, but not the world," he claims.
On FB, I download beautiful images or images from the game.
I also have fun with people I know.
"I wouldn't share a picture that's not mine, or someone who's being stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish unfaithful images of naked people, crimes, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know 35 of his FB friends and nine of his Twitter pagers.
Most of them are related.
Mother knows she has a password for one of the records.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just downloading 'em," he adds.
"Social nets are fun, I can talk to long-distance relatives or my friends fast," he says.
Unthinkingly, he says he would never have accepted a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't count on someone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This young man has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask, and the latter admits that he does not know the 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't frighten me, 'cause we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one was trusting him or asking for his home address or phone number.
"If I get pressed or pressed, I'll just take it out of my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not alien to the experience of what is now known as Cybermobing.
A friend of mine was being blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and extorted.
"He never found out who it was," he assured.
The victim, according to José, did not delete the record.
"Only included confidentiality."
He then explains the sequence of steps to set up the account in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have downloaded photographs of people he knew in uncomfortable or conflicting situations.
Yeah, I would if I didn't like a man or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's a Cybermobing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marios Porras, an English teacher and a specialist in education and education, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"The Internet has appeared as a means to search for information, but with the arrival of these sites, the rules of the game have changed," she observes.
Porras points out that the academist Mark Prensky, a teacher at Yale University, and the author of the work, the Digital Aborigines and the Immigrants, invented the terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aborigines are them, children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
"We're digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning ourselves," she says.
Explains that the subject is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain test of what can or cannot be distributed, published or spoken, at an age when maturity is not sufficient to do so”.
"Even so that they're selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends, not to think about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show what privacy is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do so is pointless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like to have a picture of you like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know that others publish about you?
When you sign a picture of a party, do you ask permission from other people to mark it?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you do at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they have to act online the way they do it offline.
The rules are the same.
"Over the Internet, man behaves with respect, responsibility, and other principles, as well as social media," she claims.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a professor of primary education and an educational consultant, explains the need for family heads to read the social media policies in good faith.
By understanding each point, they have a good reason to talk to children about the prerequisites for opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published," he says.
According to Gourdia, the key question is to remind the kids of the "don't talk to strangers."
UNASUR summit ends without the declaration of Lima
The VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the declaration of the Lima Declaration, which was previously and in theory signed by the seven bound participants.
Efe has tried to access the document signed at the Sixth Assembly of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR on a number of occasions, but sources from the Office and the President ' s Administration have indicated on the main page that it will be translated after the closure, but have then confirmed that it will be published on the Peru Government ' s website at a certain time.
On questions about the text, they indicated that the content had been given by the President of Peru, Oliant Umala, during the press briefs.
The access of journalists to information about the Summit has been restricted all the time.
In the course of the day, it was only aired in the press hall, a video of the President's Assembly with a message of "closed session, no sound. "
Not much of the information that was circulating among reporters was shared by some UNASUR government press representatives who attended the meeting, but not Peruan.
The only document distributed in the course of the day was a list of participating presidents, which caused discontent on the part of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
The Government of the President of Peru subsequently sent an e-mail to the media with a "final declaration" of the summit, but this is a message from Umala, rather than an official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was also not distributed, despite press insistence.
The ASPA official website can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities had made efforts to ensure that the system of transmission for all journalists was in place, but to limit the information to the extent possible.
The summit also culminated in a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt a judgement of the Hague Court, which settles a territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinier, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice, which began on Monday in The Hague the hearing of the statements of both parties, in the context of the charge that Lima had put forward against Santiago.
"We will respect and implement a decision that will make clear the differences we are currently representing in this international court," said Umala, next to her Chilean colleague.
“Chili was, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of differences, covenants, and international tribunals,” he added, and applauded Umal's hand in the context of the two flags.
The confirmation by the two Presidents that they would be subject to the International Court of Justice took place immediately after Colombia protested this week against the Bogotá Pact, according to which it recognized subjection to the verdicts of the international court following the decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it found to be wrong.
The summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former President, Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Umala, was responsible for the opening of the debate in the morning and for the closing of the summit, just after noon in Lima time.
The Head of State read the outcome document, in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and action lines had been approved for 31 South American projects, and that the expected investment amounted to $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries would take “important steps towards the purpose of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the residence agreements”.
He reported that action was being taken to improve “cooperation in the fight against public insecurity and organized transnational crime, action to increase the availability of drugs, low-cost Internet access in all parts of South America, and to take into account the combined and effective risk of natural disasters”.
Since Europe is in crisis, “the economic unification (Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our productive base and foresaw a better future for our cities,” Oomala added.
"We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve South America's connectivity, especially in the countryside and border zones ... uniting our countries and creating new economic schemes," the Peruvian President said in a message he read.
Among the projects, he mentioned that five were from Peru, and were restricted to transverse axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, while two focused on a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide any more details.
The outcome document also addressed the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to re-accede to the Union of South American Nations, from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united and to have good relations among its neighbours, was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before he began to attend the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City, to negotiate in a respectful manner the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of an international court challenged by Bogotá.
"The next day (saturday), perhaps meet President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
“Let us renegotiate all these paths; they are not mutually exclusive, including a pact with Nicaragua, will require discussion with Nicaragua”, he stressed.
"with President Ortega, I hope I can tell him we can deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," he added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they have a new President, Henrique Peña Nieto, to take office.
Also in the context of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which is aimed at strengthening dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the participation of the last country has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
“South America has to learn from Europe on the integration of citizenship”: Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, has today confirmed that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the VIth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, said to Peru's public television that Europeans had “killed each other during the Second World War” and in other clashes, “but now they are almost the same country”.
It has, in this context, defended the South American citizenship project, which is endorsed by the UNASUR participating countries.
"There must be free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want us back in the past," he cautioned.
The Ecuadorian President has also been a supporter of the relaunching of the Organization of American States (OAS), with a view to reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Human Rights Pact.
The lecturers never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the other hand, sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington, D.C., and is financed by the United States,” he said, insinuating the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured us that he was not sorry for this decision, because he was not with him to give up his principles, but to respect his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that at one time “there was some suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be followed”.
He also criticized Swedish justice for requiring him to come to his territory for questioning of the alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish law itself considers it possible to implement it by means of a video conference, which could have been made from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London”.
Correa has confirmed that there is a risk of a deterioration in Assange's physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said the Head of State of Ecuador.
What's real is the risk of a deterioration in his physical and mental health due to a captivity in a small space without the ability to exercise in the air.
"This has an impact on the health of any man," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution to the problem of asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing a security guarantee to enable him to go to Ecuador, was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary, and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate human rights, a word we do not use in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the European judiciary, because assange's lawyer, Balthasar Garson, is running a number of trials in various European jurisdictions," he mentioned.
And he thought, "if the United Kingdom gives us a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, it'll be over."
And if Sweden, as well as its legal framework, and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interviews him on Skype, the problem will be over tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to manifest himself as a defender of press freedom and stressed that he did not tolerate “mediocy, bad faith, and lies, which distorted freedom of expression”.
"The main enemies of press freedom are not the spoiled villains of politics, but the bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this respect, he was content that neither these journalists nor “the bankers nor the bourgeois hegemons do not dominate Ecuador” and added that, by re-elected, “will deepen the revolution to continue to develop in the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the mask of legitimacy”, because in fact,“it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy”.
The Ecuadorian President also found “perfectly justified” the desire of his Colombian colleague, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which was in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
This decision has not been implemented so far.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the desire to go together.
They need to be addressed together in order to overcome them and to move on.
He also expressed the hope for a good conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute in the same court in Chile and Peru, and said that “it is right for Latin America to go to international bodies if the two countries commit themselves to a decision, no matter how grave it may be”.
With regard to the opportunity to stand as a candidate for Ecuador's upcoming presidential elections to run for a third consecutive term, he indicated that he was considering the possibility “with great optimism and joy, though at times it is rather difficult”.
Correa assured us that if he loses in the elections in February 2013, he will be out of public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can be remedied only by political power.
"My political movement thought I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to accept this responsibility," he said.
If you win, it would be my last term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
"This is the decision," he confirmed.
Correa also referred to the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Venezuelan vice-president, Nicholas Maduro, who told me he was going to the treatment that was already scheduled to be routine, and he's expected to miss the campaign to go back to Cuba.
"This does not mean the health of President Chávez," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State today attended the VIth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Deaths from AIDS today are the result of late diagnosis
The fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS test had been positive.
"It's like I've been deafened," he remembers, despite all the doctor's tactics, the moment.
The boy hid it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts were justified, and he was already on his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the “oldest” patients in the Hospital Hospital for Hospital de Guadalajara (HCG), where it was admitted in 1994, and has overcome a number of obstacles.
He has been living with the diagnosis of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, and in the early 1990s it would have been hard to believe that there were too few treatments then, too few people knew about the disease, too biased about the sick.
So even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection didn't want to say good-bye to him "because he had a cut."
In other words, at that time, it was a sentence to have AIDS.
Now it's possible to survive this Syndrome and do it without making the quality of life worse.
Still, without knowing about their disease, many people still come when the virus has already harmed their immune system, and they are suffering from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “the greatest achievement at the moment is that the patient's survival, who is beginning to be treated in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population is exactly the same”, pointed out the head of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, citing that this information was confirmed in a prestigious scientific publication in April this year.
Infectious and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that, since 2008, scientists have come to the conclusion that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the rate of immunization available to patients at the start of the diagnosis, with a better life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years with 500 CD4 reported.
Simply put, the above means that a person who is diagnosed with HIV positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, “by maintaining control, can live without problems up to 75 years of age”, he explained.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the average lifespan of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has fallen significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the annual report of UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since the emergence of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people had died in 2011 and 187 had already been killed by May of this year; however, it has been claimed that there has been universal access to anti-retroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still fatals?
- Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I picture it. That's how things are in our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years, we haven't had a shortage of medication, the problem is, the patients come very late, because they don't know about their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He quoted the staggering data: "Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some sort of opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and so we need to provide samples for detection on a massive scale, for all people who ask for it."
In his proposal, the experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA) as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a private lab for a test, prompted by his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Caposhi sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the common complications.
Things change when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know.
"If I die anyway, I'd rather get drunk three times a week," they say, "but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I'm good at eating, doing exercise, taking my meds.
To date, his parents only know he's been through cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of classes, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with a shared responsibility, I take care of myself and another person," said Fabrizio, who has agreed to share his private life with MILENIO JALISCO to make a statement to those who are now, in the context of World AIDS Day, in fear.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive, so let them know, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person who is responsible.
His presentation summed up the theme of the fight against AIDS this year.
Condoms behind the counter
Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has been involved in the HIV problem, claims to be a major gap between health-care programmes and a common citizen.
And the biggest thing is prevention.
In the places on the subject, "in fact, there has been an increase in the distribution of condoms, we've been given one or two before, now we have a package of hundreds, and that's very good, but it turns out there are people who still don't have access to the condom," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you want them?" this popular question, with ejection and condemnation, by social workers, school counselors, pharmacists, and health-care workers, who don't want to hear from teenagers, has been assured by the propagandist.
I suggest that this inefficient distribution be changed; that condoms be not just behind the counters, and that hundreds of them be in machine-guns in public toilets in places that are often visited by young people.
It's not promiscuity.
It was not about the payment of a beer or a motel, and Governor Emilio Gonzalez replied when he was asked if it was possible to distribute condoms under his supervision.
"It's not sexy, it's best to make condoms available to those who are already practising sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Jalisco
There are 13.435 registered cases (12.158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is ranked four in the national ratings for new and combined AIDS cases and the 13th in HIV.
92% of the infections are from the sex path, 6% from blood, and 2% from the perinatal path.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are between 4 and 5 people who don't know about it.
In view of the United States Court of Appeal ' s ratification of a decision that nullifies the restructuring of the Vitro Group ' s debt through a competitive process in Mexico, the scenario sets a fatal precedent for any national company with subsidiaries in a neighbouring country that has a problem with capacity to pay.
It does not seem that the procedures to support the survival of firms, which are permitted by Mexican law, are valid in the country, in contravention of international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of the 15 June decision of Judge Harlin Hale at the Bankruptcy Court of the North Texas County leaves defenceless Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on the other side of Rio Grande.
The ruling, however, opens the doors of the leading glass maker in Mexico to the United States Supreme Court, and proves three inconsistencies.
As an introduction, while the judge of the case states that the creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, states that the main proceeding is a competitive proceeding in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created, as an arbiter, by the American Institute of Law.
Second, the verdict states that, without an inter-firm vote, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved in the critical mass of the competitive debt that the Vitro subsidiaries owed to the parent company.
Nevertheless, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-firm debts have been guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Industries.
It is also true that by deducting the votes of the subsidiaries, in one way or another, the lenders of Vitro, who fought against it in the United States courts, such as vultures, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
The Court of Appeal deletes this information.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation she has been facing since 2008 as a result of the serious economic crisis that the United States has been hit by invading the country.
So far, the family firm of Gonzalez Sada will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself to reach its plenary, i.e., five judges, in view of the fact that only three have voted.
In the event of failure, an application for a certificate will be submitted, which will require a review of the trial by the High Court, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
Worse still, the court rejected a document sent by the Government of Mexico as amicus curiae (the "friend of the court"), which describes the process followed by Vitro under the Act on Competitive Proceedings, signaling that it is exempt from compliance with the agreements signed by the two countries in order to link it to article 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e., the rules established for cases of inter-State insolvency, which guarantee equal rights for debtors and creditors.
Carambol from two sides: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Overall balance
Taking into account the months-long motions put on the table by the Mexicana de Aviación trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrage Andrade, who is charged with fraud, the Trade Union Association of Airplane Pilots has already found a bottleneck.
The office headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morino has just submitted a criminal case against the National Banks and Securities Commission, which is charged with obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory body has systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic on an operation carried out by an entrepreneur to extract from the trust fund the F/589 bank of IXE 198 million peso, on behalf of the Mexican Airlines.
The resources would be used to buy the shares of the Hotel Professional Management Company.
As you know, Ascarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas Hotel Network.
Dragon Mart surrounds
On the weekend of a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of local and foreign ecologists, scientists, businessmen, and members of the general civil society endorsed the creation of a broad front to counter the opening of China’s Dragon Martin in Cancún.
We're talking, as you know, about a giant center for the sale and distribution to Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean of the products of an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for 150 companies.
In the past, Canacintra has been able to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone to confront the monumental forces, which have levelled off some of the protected areas and posed serious threats to the industry.
ACTA Death
With regard to the Government ' s request to the Senate to explain the circumstances and circumstances under which the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan has signed the Trade Agreement against Counterfeiting, known as the Acronym in the English ACTA, according to the Mexican Industrial Property Institute, the case has already been archived.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of viewing it as a violation of freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debt, without affecting short-term housing, Homex marketed 500 million Peso certificates.
Release is the first of four identical, with an offer of interest every 28 days.
Competival appears in the world
The NYCE, e-Quality, and Kernet, the information technology leaders, a consortium with the trade name Competival has just come to life, and will aim at a market for software clusters in Central and South America.
Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
Hearten's long-time basketball explorer, Hector Reyes, has been associated with this sport for over 60 years and has been able to travel the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector "Heatin" Reyes.
And before the brain hemorrhaging in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for over 60 years, as a player in small classes, as a player in the High Basketball League, as an authorized and BSN leader with the Baaemon Cowboys, and as the president of the Basketball Federation.
"I've played a lot of role in basketball over my life, including a bit at the same time as I was president of BSN, the Director-General of the National Team, and the President of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes remembers during his visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate by making that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things gathered on his long way, bear witness to this.
Bayamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, he retains those who remember his way through the Cowboys, from the mid 1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old as a co-agent or a contract agent.
"This was my best years, which I've enjoyed most, because I've been able to be part of eight Cowboys since 1967, as an agent, as a co-agent, or as a manager.
There have been many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Minsey's debut at BSN.
Since then, Cuco Ortiz, who was the great administrator, has been the head of the organization,” states Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartov, who was on his way here and was at Alabama University, Birmingham, said to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7."
"Do you want to?"
And this was the start of Mincy, one of Puerto Rico's best players.
Bartov then recommended a sniper, Raymond Gowss, who got his citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Mincey brought the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would help win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboys' Champion with Gauss, but I was already away, because by 1988 I was the Federation Chief.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and those of Mincey in the national team.
I remember the first time we won from the United States during an Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place, and it was supposed to be bronze, if it weren't for the Canadian judge who made us replay the final game, Reyes said.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She was among the best, as was the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we shattered the U.S. team, which was pretty much the same as the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
Not only did Mincy, Gaussa, Ramón Rivas, Fico López and Piculin (Ortisa) play the band again, but also the young (Havier) "Tonyito" Colon and James Carter, the Leon Brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Kichote" Morales, who was unable to participate in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but which has brought us a golden medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifications tournament in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role-players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice, and young Rolando Hurrouitner to replace the players suspended for messing up in the Panama City Mar del Plata Cup, we won gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performance at international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Pikulin did.
And that's not taking into account his careers in the various leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican manager?
It's a very complex question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I love the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you think is your major achievement in the Federation?
Attended in the most glorious period of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s BSN had up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have to do?
There were things I wanted to do, for example, regionalize smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponce play only in their own field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and it's superfluous.
At least I see the benefits of mandatory certification and a course for managers, officials and judges.
I'm enjoying it.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch my age music video on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and sometimes go to basketball.
And, of course, enjoying the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
The actor Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world-renowned for his main role as John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the Dallas TV series, in which he embodied a businessman without principles, evil, and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as J.R. Yuing's oil magnate in the Dallas TV series was a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died on Friday night due to complications due to cancer, according to a family statement for The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a Dallas production studio.
"Larry has returned to his beloved hometown Dallas, again playing the role he loved most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas at the Thanksgiving fair.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original show and in the sequel, was next to Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, said her representative, Geoffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, sweet and talented, and I'm gonna miss him so much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," affirmed Gray in the statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted to having been drinking for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver, and he was transplanted.
Long before Dallas, Hagman gained prominence on TV by playing a good-looking role in the easy comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", which was aired by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets a pretty girl, a gina, who is played by Barbara Eden, and starts living with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies, who rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the movie included well-received roles by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his workshop to interpret the delightful J.R. led Hagman to the top of fame.
The CBS drama show about the Yuings and other characters around it aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The "Who shot J.R." slogan, designed to make a fuss about the episode, full of emotion, in which Hagman's character was almost killed, created international discussions, and the millions of dollars that were at risk in bookies.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the show at that time.
When a response was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned "Dallas" into the second-largest feature of the entertainment program in history, after the final "MASH" in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
She was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine (in the performance of Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. interfered with her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but the others also had a reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupter with a charismatic smile: an dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his husband to be treated by an alcoholic, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what should be on the J.R. gravel." Hegman said in 1988.
It has to say, "Here lies an honest citizen J.R. Ying."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Principal, also the character of the original show, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone "growing, both on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of worshipers all over the world, and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas release were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT.
Recording of five episodes of the second season was completed and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement about what will happen to the show after Hagman left.
Born of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of an actress and a singer, Mary Martin, who was brilliant in such classical works as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, he tried to be happy on the theatre scenes of New York, and then served in the Air Force of England from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, Mai Axelson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tale (and Absolutely True) Tales out of My Life.
"I didn't include anything in it that I thought would hurt anyone or affect them in any way," he said to Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he promoted organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients with fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet with them when they go into surgery, and after," he pointed out in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He has also been active in anti-smoking and has been involved in several campaigns.
A course is under way that explores the end of the world.
Every week, students study apocalyptic phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this semester, when Professor of Religion Stuart Charme decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible bait: the end of the Mayan calendar, on 21 December, for which a lot of people have taken hold as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Sharma had no idea what was coming in the next couple of months: the catastrophic storm of Sandy, the financial crisis that some call the long-armeddon, and the growing conflict that Israel is embracing, a place where Christian end-of-time theorists think the Apocalypse is about to begin.
"I didn't know it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," said Charma this week to the University of Rutgers-Camden, New Jersey.
If you look at what's going on in the world today, as if we only had 30 days left, it was a really good time.
And remember, bad things are good for those who have an apocalyptic mindset.
And he's not the only professor who's offering a course on "the end of the world" in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, Professor Barry Walker has a course on media, culture and the end of the world.
Every week, students study apocalyptic subjects, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're looking at why these ideas are spreading over time," he said, "and the way in which hypothetical scenarios are put forward that cause certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war can break out.
This month, the students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they related to real-life examples.
"I tried to tell the students what might be plausible and impossible," said Walker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History, Matthew Restall, and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of art and anthropology, united to read a course called the "End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again, in the event the end of the world does not come," said Restall.
Despite the “imminent destruction,” students have to learn, design and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be accepted on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves the student with no choice but to work “until the very night the world is supposed to end”, said Restall.
Courses have turned out to be quite popular.
"The place was over in two hours," he said, "and he's got a class for high-level middle-level students, for which 35 of the students have been enrolled.
We've been getting e-mail messages for weeks before the beginning of the semester from people who've been asking if there's any room left.
The students, in turn, say that this class is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student in the Department of Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is just a matter of consolation or its absence.
Will Vequez, a 25-year-old student in the Psychology and Nursing Department, said he was watching all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a class to teach it," he remarked.
I like it.
But none of the students surveyed - let alone the Professor - said he believed in the date of the end of the world on 21 December.
"Our first project touched on the Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it," said Julie Sieglen, a 21-year-old student at the University of Temple of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; this is just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he pointed out that there was an apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which lasted for centuries, where people reacted to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
"In other places, people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in an English-speaking world.
Joseph Doherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who is a lecturer in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he was aware of any course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not take part at the end of the world," he wrote, insinuating a superior order.
We have a pardon from the pope.
Restall pointed out that for a long time there had been talk of many days of the last court, and he said that if nothing happened on 21 December, "people would start to think about the next date" or to philosophize that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are careless on this date.
Some say they're gonna go to end-of-the-world parties.
"Maybe I'll call one of my friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old telecommunications student.
