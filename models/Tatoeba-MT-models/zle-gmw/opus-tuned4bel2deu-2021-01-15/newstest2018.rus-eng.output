The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has signed a law to impose administrative liability for the violation of the time limit and the procedure for the payment of goods (work, services) in the procurement of public and municipal needs.
The Act is intended to address the very serious problem of non-fulfilment of obligations by customers in public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation in which businessmen were not able to receive payment under existing State and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia commissioned the Office of the Attorney-General of the Russian Federation to take the problem for special control.
Because businessmen themselves could not deal with unscrupulous bidders who entered into unfinished contracts, made every effort to evade their payment obligations, and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was system-wide in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of businessmen to be paid by public order, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has made 9,000 submissions, with 4,500 officials being subject to disciplinary action, 533 administrative officers, and 75 files have been submitted to the investigating bodies for the organization of the procedural review, 46 of which have been subject to criminal proceedings.
As a result, more than 66 billion roubles of business debt was paid.
These massive sums, however, have not been accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multi-billion-dollar contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs for much more modest sums have led to immense debts.
Here's the case.
The manager of a small company won a competition for social transport services for a few million roubles.
The man invested all his working capital, fully met his obligations, but he didn't get the money on time.
The result is an increasing financial coma of wage, tax, credit that would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not sought the help of the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
The problem has now been overcome as far as possible in a number of regions.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt on State and municipal contracts identified by the procurators of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical levels, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office is working in a manual crisis management regime.
The Attorney-General personally holds field meetings with the local authorities to deal in a substantive manner with all the violations that have been detected by the prosecutors and to address them without delay.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Jaroslavla and Yekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of Federal Act No. 189-FZ “On the amendment of the Code of Administrative Offences with regard to the administrative liability of the employer's officials for the violation of the time and procedure for the payment of goods (work, services) in the procurement of public and municipal needs”, which was signed last week by the President of the Russian Federation.
The draft law was drawn up by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Office of the Attorney-General.
The new Act will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences with an article which provides for a fine of between 30,000 and 50,000 roubles for breaching the time limit and the procedure for the payment of goods, work and services by an official of the employer in State and municipal procurement.
If an official has already been administratively punished for a similar offence, he or she will be disqualified for a period of from one to two years.
All the procurators of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to implement these legislative innovations in practice.
The Civil Rights Unit has issued a travel warning to Missouri.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored Populations has issued a warning to colored people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory state policy and racist attacks.
The group's statement is as follows: “Warning for travelers of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on African American travelers, visitors and Missouri citizens to be particularly careful and cautious in their travels through the state in connection with a number of dubious racist incidents that have recently taken place all over the state and are here”.
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Non-Farbs, a recent Missouri law prompted the group to issue a warning, making it more difficult for people to win claims of discrimination, as well as the fact that state law enforcement agencies disproportionately target members of minorities.
“You people are subject to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of their skin color, and they are beaten and killed,” Rhode Chapel, President of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population of Missouri, told The Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints more often than ever."
This is the first such warning that the organization has given to the state of the United States.
The Group referred to incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at Missouri University and the death of Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee, who was 20 years old.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas on a state trip, and Missouri State Police arrested him without charge of a crime.
The warning also refers to a recent report by the Attorney General of Missouri State, according to which the risk of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for white drivers.
“The aim of the warning is to make people aware of the situation and to warn their family and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” said Chapelle.
“People have to be trained in one way or another, whether they take the money to bail or tell the family that they're traveling through state territory.”
According to the latest FBI hate crime report, there have been 100 hate crimes in Missouri in 2015, making the state the 16th state in terms of the number of such violations.
A travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri State Act, which will make it more difficult to bring a legal action against a legal entity for reasons of housing or labour discrimination.
Previously, the American Union for the Defence of Civil Liberties (ACLU) had issued warnings to travelers in Texas and Arizona after these states had enacted new immigration control laws, under which local law enforcement agencies had been ordered to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which ACLU believed should have increased the number of checks based on race.
Traffic warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but more recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Two people were killed in a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown men fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reporting the Reuters with a reference to the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
During the exchange of fire, two people, including one policeman, died, and three were injured.
All the wounded have been taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on the law-guards.
One of the intruders was detained, the other managed to escape.
Rostourism supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-returnable airfares
The head of Rostourism, Oleg Safonov, stated in an interview with RBC TV that it was “suspects” to adopt a law abolishing the free shipment of baggage on non-returnable airfares.
"We need to create an environment in which a person who has no baggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has a bag," he stressed (the TASS quote).
Mr. Safonov noted, however, that, despite the fear of the citizens, it would not be necessary to pay for the carriage of top clothes and a mobile phone in a hand-held box.
"It would be right to appease all of our citizens and tourists and say it, say it's on top of the dress, on the umbrella, on the mobile phone, on the iPad, or even on some computer," said the head of Rostourism.
Formerly, Russia’s President, Wladimir Putin, has signed a law providing for the right of airlines to rule out the rule on the free transport of baggage on a non-returnable airfare.
This means that airlines can determine for themselves the number of spaces and the weight of baggage included in the non-return rate.
Wladimir Poetin has commissioned the clean-up of Baikal pollution
Russian President Wladimir Poetin, at a meeting on the protection of the Baykala, reported that in recent years, large areas of the lake had been severely polluted.
It commissioned the identification of sources of funding, plans and implementers to address the pollution.
Mr. Poetin has also commissioned a full-scale remediation of polluted areas.
"We also need to deal with the facilities that are still working here, most of them have been shattered," quotes the President's RIA News.
He also added that the Office of the Attorney-General of the Russian Federation should carry out a check on the identification of ecologically harmful activities.
According to him, there are problems in the lake area due to the occurrence of natural dumps and a number of environmental disturbances by the resters.
"I want to stress this: not everyone has to check it out, but it's illegal and environmentally harmful activity to know it, and to take appropriate action," he stressed.
The Office of the Attorney-General had previously reported a decrease in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had proposed an increase in the number of sites subject to environmental surveillance.
Recall, on 15 June, in a direct line, Vladimir Putin stated that there was a need to amend the law to ensure the rights of citizens who live in the natural territories of a special security regime.
He was informed of the economic problems of the people of Olhon Island, which is part of the Baikal Territory.
The head of the Department of Nature, Sergei Donskaya, immediately proposed a solution to the problem by clarifying the limits of the Baykal water protection zone, but in the Government of Buritia, it was recalled that such a change was not sufficient, as the restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
Previously, in the Ministry of Economics, a proposal was made to address the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
There will be a new temple in Souther.
In the village of Sosová, members of the community from the small indigenous peoples of the North, “Rahtnia”, together with the Berezovsky region, are engaged in the construction of an Orthodox Temple in honor of the saint Nikolai the Miracle.
Its location is a river bank, the temple will be well seen from afar, so it will be a beacon for the fishers.
According to the community, the construction work will be completed this year, the dome is now in place, and church bells are in place.
The Player ' s Fleet has provided a transport escort.
The Temple is named after St. Nikolai the Wonderful, for he is a patron of the Orthodox Church, including fishers.
In Sosova, fishing gives the settlers work, feeds them.
The locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and the children are even writing about it in their school essays as local sights.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why Singapore’s Laws?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in a diner in the open air.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after the other, while he carefully puts the cigarettes in an iron box he has taken from his office.
After the interview, the businessman goes to the nearest urn, up to a hundred meters, and dumps bulls.
A fine for trash in a public place of $500 local, reports Chang.
You know, I've had a reflex since I was a kid. You can't drop a candy fan off the bridge, you'll be fined right away.
And now there are video cameras everywhere.
And indeed, Singapore's sidewalks in the middle of the city are clean, like a museum.
Chang tells us, three months ago, an 18-year-old son of a neighbor painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to flogging.
What?!
Imagine.
He was hit 10 times with a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
We don't get a lot of corporal punishment at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and the incredibly strict laws, the AIF columnist was on the ground.
There's no one here thinking of abominating the death penalty,” explains counsel, Victor Lee Hong.
For a long time, the government has not cared about the views of the EU or the US on this.
If a person transports or sells a lot of drugs, he will have a gallows.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian was arrested at Changi Airport, carrying 400 g of cocaine.
It was defended by the Australian Premier, threatening with sanctions, international human rights defenders, and even the pope.
But the guy was eventually hung up.
After that, the drug couriers of our country are diligently rounding up the country.
The point is, Singapore has a legal obligation to respect everyone in a row, not just the lowly and the poor.
It doesn't matter if you're a millionaire, a vice-premier, a well-known artist or a European man.
The one option is, if you find a pound of coke, you'll be hanging.
When you're walking around Singapore and you meet a bunch of warnings all over the place, you just wonder how many bans there are in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and it can be bought strictly by a doctor’s prescription.
No gum will be taken from a tourist when he arrives, but if he puts a "bone" on the subway, he will be fined $1,000.
In four days, I met two people with white signs on my neck, "I was trashing."
In addition to a fine, a custard is often sentenced to a letter to a janitor for a week to clean up parks and beaches.
The “offender” pays 6,000 roubles, who forgets to wash the water in the public toilet, and when an effort is made to make a small need in the elevator of the home, a special detector is used to block the doors and send a signal to the police.
Exotic laws include bans on feeding doves on the street, public singing of songs, and even over-spraying of a room plant (!), which are considered to be an attraction for mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers are not allowed to carry lighters in the subway, or they will be fined $5,000.
Well, there's an idea, no matter how hard you try, you're gonna break something.
It's not like that, but it's trying to unravel me, Mohammed Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of a local travel agency.
The most fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last 20 years, I have not seen anyone get involved for violating them.
Why do they stay?
So the citizens don't relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
Let's say, if a minor is sold a cigarette in a kiosk, he'll be punished in a chain: the owner of the shop will pay a lot of money, the intruder himself will be hit with sticks on the back, and the seller will also be flogged and put in jail.
It is because of such strict laws of crime in Singapore that it is very rare.
Is this true?
As far back as the 1970s, we had a chaotic situation on the roads - motorists ignored traffic, drove as they wanted, got drunk behind the wheel.
After the year's fines, things got quieter.
Now the driver, having a shot of whisky, knows that if they stop, the cop won't let go for a bribe, he'll be fined the cost of the apartment, and he'll be sent to jail for years.
For many foreigners, the city-state in South-East Asia seems to be a form of concentration camp.
In 1993 the American author William Gibson called Singapore "Death Island", a visitor from the United States of America, terrorized the wealth of the people, "a frighteningly clean airport" and "cultural nature".
Discretion, such things are unnatural, they look artificial, and they don't have to be.
For the first days in Singapore, and you're right to be afraid to drop your paper on the sidewalk, catching up on the subway with ice cream.
But then you go to Little India, and all of a sudden, the "shatter of the template" is that the bus stop has plastic cups.
"What do you mean?", you're amazed.
And like this, the Singaporeans laugh.
Things happen.
Not every "offence" like this will get caught on the spot, but you need to know, if you get found out, you won't get cleaned up, 'cause you've broken the law.
Most of the time, it's enough for a man to be normal.
Of course, Singapore’s power is very authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh, I was moving very cautiously. Motorcyclists often take smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
Downtown Paris is full of filthy hobos and beggars.
Not everyone on our streets is trying to dump trash in the trash.
Singapore, however, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (until the death penalty) laws, has become the most peaceful, clean and secure city on Earth.
You'll think about it.
That's the human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one was seated behind the wheel until they got fined.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, it is voluntary law enforcement.
And we have to think that we in Russia, too, would enjoy the clean streets, the absence of trash in the subway, and welcome the arrest of those who mix the elevator with the public toilet.
Here's the corporal punishment - thank you, don't.
In the rest, Singapore's laws are at least worth looking at.
Nothing sacred?
Now the White House of Trump is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The surest sign of a change of mode is when it starts to fight the statues.
The Americans understand this as well as everyone else -- from here on purpose, the theatrical demolishing of the statue of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of Trump's key ideologues, no doubt knew what he was doing when he put the symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the President's proposals for a dramatic reduction in legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try the statue.
The men of pleasure boats and artists who picture the Statue of Liberty would have lynched it if he tried to do it.
But he tried to get her meaning, and especially to the point that was attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the monument was finished, when Emma Lazarus was added to the pedestal.
As Miller groaned at Acosta, "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem you're talking about was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller put the facts right, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
It's about the current sound of the astonishing words of Lazarus, the only one in which the state not invite any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your mobs dreaming of sighing free / the miserable scum of your rich shores."
"Unhappinessous trash" has never been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature -- he made it clear that in America, Trump didn't expect these people.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus, and her friends, who fought to put her words in the middle of the statues after her death, were very well aware that they were doing a very political act.
The sculpture was meant to mark the link between the French and American republics by means of a banal classical figure, a woman's image of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
Combining the poem and image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack against American naiveism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right, though, changed it back.
Lucid Rush Limbo, a sort of John the Baptizer who announced the arrival of Trump in 2010, reasoned that Freedom did not invite anyone, rather she was an early neo-conservative carrying the flames of America in the darkness of the world: "Freedom is moving forward.
It carries a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the way to the United States."
Against the custom of Limbo, it's really got to the point.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the point of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would have been seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful men on the decks of the ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
It means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who are seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue responds to them with the words of hope and hospitality they want to hear.
And, of course, this is not the kind of perspective Miller and Trump would ever want to admit.
Their torch is not needed to light the way, but to stir up the hatred that is the only source of their power.
The World Cup of 2017: Neil Blake highly values the Scottish members of the United Kingdom.
Aileed Doyle remembers a time when there were only two Scots in the UK.
Neil Blake, director of the United Kingdom Light Athletics Federation, said that a 16-member Scottish team at the World Cup would make a “important contribution to the team's game.
The record number of Scots lightweights was selected for the 2010 London Cup, which began on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland, “something special is being born” and that the Federation of Light Athletics of the United Kingdom should take this into account.
"We know it and we're trying to understand it and we're gonna keep it up as long as they have the potential," said Blake.
"I spoke to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport, and they think it has to do with what they've done.
The Scottish Federation of Light Athletics thinks that what they've done has to be done.
The British Federation of Light Athletics: what they've done has to be done.
And the people on the street think the same thing.
I don't know why this is the case, but it's brilliant."
Some of the Scots Athletes claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Buchert, who will compete with Sir Moe Farah at a distance of 5000 m; and Aileed Doyle has selected the team as his captain.
"Aileed is modest.
Her captain's speech was brilliant," says Blake.
"Many light-flyers, whether they're Scots or not, and from where they live or train, left this room, feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Aylid put in it were wonderful."
The owner of the Silver Medal of the Commonwealth Cup, who will run 400 meters in her fifth World Cup with obstacles, says that 16 Scots in the British team are "unthinkable."
The previous record for the world championship was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Muir, who specializes in the middle-distance race, scored five British and two European records last year.
She'll run at 1500 and 500 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who is going to be in the 1500 meters race, is another Scotsman who needs to be looked at: behind his back, he has a successful season in which he won the British team's qualifiers and the Annual Contests.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when Lee McConnell was the only Scotch on the team.
The captain of the team says she's "incredibly proud" of how many of her compatriots not only joined the team, but in some cases they'll be claiming medals and fighting for the finals.
"The captain of the team is selected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor in any case, but to know that your comrades voted for you and you were chosen, - for me, it's a very special thing," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who joined the team.
This shows how much we've done.
And they're all easy-fashioned people who're gonna try to get on a pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was pretty good.
I just noticed we're very lucky to have the World Cup at home.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we're gonna be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go to his arena and take part in the competition, and it's gonna be a great atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: You don't have to go to public office if you're not ready to listen to voter criticism
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn't shut his critics up.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "It's possible to take away the freedom of speech, and we, the deaf and the mute, will be led as sheep to the slaughter."
Now I'm going to go to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should have tried to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subsidiaries have blocked and erased the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Union for the Defence of Civil Liberties sued him for it.
The governor's subsidiaries called the lawsuit a nullity, and the online comment was written in the spirit of "so and so."
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people will say.
But it's also important.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He's an incredibly popular Republican governor in a state-of-the-art democracy.
He's ranked second in the country's 50 governors' approval rating.
Hogan is an unbridled reactionary.
He has shown a strong hand in the management of the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook as a primary way of communicating with his constituents, and with jokes on his page displays his bald head after chemo.
So blocking the people who come to the Governor's page -- which is declared an official public forum and is run by the administration on the money of the taxpayers -- is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, the Spokesman, Amelia Ches, defended the Governor's actions, claiming that blocking the comments was just their moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spamers, and haters who are off the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people Hogan's blocking.
And it's real people, not trolls -- a teacher, a businessman, a pastor, who turn to their chosen leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan to be a Catholic.
Lakshmi's lawyer, Sarma Ramana, from Bowie, Maryland, did not express her hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed at his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the section of the commentary to the article in the Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same subject, some people say it's a so-called trick instead of admitting they're dealing with a big group of disgruntled citizens."
What the governor's subsidiaries call a “concentrated spam attack”, others would probably call a “active position of life.
In the Facebook era, it is easy to sub-edit their image by simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
It's a much less dusty job than it used to be, when it was to send people, pick up and burn up critically frontlined newspapers, or arrest and shut the mouth of protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just in the number.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users, who were swamped in his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on this subject was taken this week in Virginia.
In the opinion of the U.S. District Judge of Alexandria, James C. Kesheris, the president of the County Watching Council of Laudon violated the First Amendment by taking out a voter in her Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, the Republican Governor Matt Bevin was sued by the American Union for the Defence of Civil Liberties for his actions on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington, the era of affordable postal expenses, it was about as much a revolution as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters severely undermined its authority.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms Juricola, Valerius, Belizarius, and Porcius wrote to the newspapers to make fun of Washington's decision.
According to the historical documents compiled by the George Washington online project, his office was overwhelmed by petitions critical of his position on the Treaty of Amity, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn't try to get them to shut up.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very heart of our State.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty is looking forward to being comfortable at the Renaissance Club.
The former European champ Ronan Rafferty hopes for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lotiane hosts the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for senior athletes.
A native of Northern Ireland, who was the next-door leader at the Archerfield Links Club, and was heading for the final round last year, until he lost to Paul Ilse, was attached to the new place and served as a representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the club, Gerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance Club build, and we're watching it succeed with this event," Rafferty said.
"The gamers will see this field at its best moment, it is in an excellent state.
Jerry did a great job setting up this place.
He's a strong supporter of this game, and he's proud of his achievements here.
It's a great show for this field."
An Englishman, Ilse, looks forward to being able to stand up for the first time, despite the fact that he won the European Balling Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a really special feeling," said a Southport player.
"I failed to try to win "Extremadura Open" again because it was removed from the calendar a year after I won it.
It's magic to go back to this corner of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special impression to win last year.
This has been a very special time, and we will always remember it."
He's back in his home country, Gary Orr, who joined the European Tour for Seniors after he was 50 earlier this year.
The event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the 2013 "Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open" tournament.
"When you play at home, it's always a bit more important," said the resident of Helensborough Orr.
"You want to do a good job, but you feel it's an extra burden."
I'm very happy to play again, and I've shown a pretty good golf.
I'm content with the way things work so far."
This trio will be joined by Ian Woosnam, former Masters, and Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James, and Mark McNulty, senior majors.
Orr and former captain of the Reder Cup, Sam Torrance, two of the six Scots on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmair, and Ross Drummond.
The tournament is free, and the parking lot is £5 an hour if there's one person in the car, and £10 if there's two or more people in the car.
All the income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Typical tunnels over the highways, capable of absorbing car-exhausted carbon monoxide, are already being tested on British roads.
The country ' s transport agency, according to Autocor, has reported positive results of a 100-metre tunnel test on a road in the north of the country.
A 6-metre-high tunnel is constructed of some of the latest polymeric material that can absorb the harmful substances contained in the car exhaust.
However, the creation of an entire network of such tunnels is only part of the massive measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British are going to expand the network of chargers for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic, expand the use of commercial transport on electric traction, and upgrade the heavy-truck fleet.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is related to transport, and poor air quality is responsible for up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsud changed the punishment of disabled Mamaev to a fine
Mosgorsud changed the penalty for disabled Anton Mamaev, who had been sentenced to four and a half years in a colony, to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
The TASS reports this.
The Public Prosecutor's Office had previously asked the court to change the time period to a conditional one, explaining its request to the effect that the Mamaev disease “is preventing it from being held in prison”.
The 28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment in a general-regime colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former Special Forces combatant.
On 19 July, the court released the man from custody at a mobile court in SIZO.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian “Golden Land”
Bardin Deguei doesn't use a stove to make lunch.
She doesn't even use a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County, in the rebel Indonesian province of Papua, the housewives usually just put the sweet potatoes, which is here called a note, right in the hut.
After half an hour, a coated tuber is taken out and eats with impatient, unwashed hands.
The Degees sit on the ground floor – she has no furniture – and this is where she performs her housework, such as washing her woolly clothes from a nearby swamp.
The latrines serve as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She's the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she didn't get to work in the field.
The multi-year life here is common.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: a lot of the men in this village are unemployed, a lot of people are drinking, and there are soldiers.
“No one decides to walk the country after 5:00 p.m.,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was joined to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote in public with their hands in front of the occupying forces.
The current movement for independence from the Netherlands has quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which has maintained strict control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Anarotali is a city as remote as an abandoned city; it includes a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Jayapur, the provincial administrative center, to Nabeer, and a five-hour shake in a hired car.
There's no public transport here.
The city, with a population of about 19,000, is made up of wooden houses with bamboo fences; the roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust in a wide range of red colors.
Not many of the Indonesians, let alone the journalists, and almost none of the foreigners, have come here.
Prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries, the pope was worshipping a god called Uga Tameo.
There have been other changes.
“We were unfavorable to wear this dress,” Deguei says, pointing to his bright, hand-wrapped turban, a dark skirt, and a bright shirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population live below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy are among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest and most lucrative gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Pania, a high-rise province about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced about $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can show up on forest reserves, which are estimated at $78 billion.
This wealth, however, brings with it one misfortune for the Papuas, guaranteeing that the strong Indonesian armed forces maintain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation into The New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local troops and units, up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands for greater autonomy on the part of the pope threaten the existence of this golden vein and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papuas have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacres in the native highlands of Papua in the 1970s can be considered as genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything,” a report published in 2016 by the Brisbane Diocese contains evidence of the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture – especially, as another report states, rape and electrocution – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It's hard to count the number of casualties, because the incidents occur every week,” says Andreas Harmono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The hays have been protracted, as Papua ' s resources have attracted the inflow of resettlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The 3.5-million population of the province is 83 per cent Christian, but the demographics change as Muslim economic migrants come from densely populated Indonesian islands – Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
Yavan shops, “warungi”, sell fried chickens and a blend of gado-gado vegetables served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to stand up to the competition.
“Migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market less than the natives of Papua,” explains Abeth Yo, a 25-year-old Paniai, who moved to Jayapur, the provincial capital, for work.
“This is why the natives of Papua, Mother (female) of Papua, have lost their marketplace.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, known as the Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and violations of rights in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the President's Palace in Jakarta, a former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including the Paniai.
But there has been little change in Papua, and the locals feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken, because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, waiting for him to live up to our hopes for justice,” Yoo says.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Jokowi Paniai survived a tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children was on the street singing Christmas anthems at a fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the dark.
Scared kids told them to turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and, after a while, returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers who were drunk chased the children and beat them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, Julianus Emo 16, was so badly beaten, he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to a government office nearby, and the next day, the situation got worse.
Around a thousand pope men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They brought their ritual hunter bows and performed the white, the popuas pago dance, running in circles and playing the bird's singing.
Some protesters began to throw rocks at the police station and the military base.
When the situation got hot, the internal radios were ordered to “if the mob resists more than three times, shoot them,” it sounded like an official document that was seen by Time magazine reporters, but was not published in the local media.
The 50 - year - old Jeremias Cayama, head of the Kogo Koto district in Enarotali, felt the danger and called for calm, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen to it.
"When I turned, my left wrist was suddenly hit by a bullet," he told the magazine "TIME", standing on the porch of his brightly dyed wooden house.
Kaime still doesn't know who shot him, but he says the bullet came from the shreening of the soldiers gathered.
"There was a mob, there was a lot of shots," he adds.
The local Alfius Jowa was shot three times, as his cousin, who was a witness to the shooting, said.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” Johns, who, like many Indonesians, used one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General Jotge Mende, Chief Inspector of the Papua Police, told reporters that his officers were just "protecting" their base because it was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said the Papua Police Commissioner Pujo Sulistio in 2015.
“This is a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed, and much more wounded.
The news of the murders only got to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi spoke in Jayapur, expressing sympathies to the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical abuse of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately, that it will never recur in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security, Viranto, said that he would set up a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately, the excuses went.
“Most of the violations have occurred a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the nineties or at the start of the zeros.
The fact is, we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures to go through," he said.
Viranto then gave up on his word with the magazine TIME on June 5, in Jakarta, and said he was not planning to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be decided by a court of law."
Viranto, who was accused of “offences against humanity” in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people during the 1999 blood-blooded East Timor independence vote, said that 11 human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the Paniai victims met such statements with a gloomy distrust.
“In the last three years, I have been interrogated four times, but there has been no change at all,” says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid I'm gonna be arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'm gonna get shot."
His brother Jacobus was also of the view that the people of Pania were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came after me," he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at the villagers in the nearby Pania district of Deiya.
In a confrontation between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help bring a man unconscious to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were wounded, including children.
A 25-year-old man, Ravianos Dove, who was drowning while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angered villagers protested in front of the company ' s construction site office.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the officers, who responded with warning shots.
But the locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian SWAT) started shooting at the crowd and killed one man.
“We have been in such a panic, we are afraid of retaliation,” reported the 29-year-old Domingue of Badia magazine, who lives near the hospital and has seen the quick delivery of the wounded.
"I've been at my house for two days."
The Deyai Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to account, and the mobile police brigade was withdrawn from the region.
Paniai has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
Lack of meaningful development is a source of dissatisfaction among the tribes of the Meo, the Moni, the Dani, and the Damals, all over the green central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), an insurgency army that claims to defend the rights of the popuas by launching sporadic attacks and raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Pania, including Thadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Komia.
As a response, in recent years thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai and have been arbitrarily detained by the military under the guise of “Protection of national independence”.
Some never came back.
In Papua, Paniai is considered to be “a sad, forgotten place”.
Poverty exacerbates discontent.
A small quantity of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
The bread is, to the same extent, unavailable.
People here grow everything they eat, mostly a note, as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
The ten tubers are worth just 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, there has been an increase in the economic disparity between indigenous Papuas and new migrants, who have come in large numbers since the introduction of new flights to Nabir airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually available to better-educated and affluent migrants.
The popes rarely have the money or the skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no work or money here,” says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps Papua far from the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of the international media continue to be severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudie and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for “inconclusively aligned with the relevant organizations” despite having been given rare permissions to do videos.
According to Felim Keene, the Deputy Director for Asia, Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the Jokowi campaign to lift media restrictions in order to promote transparency and development have not been met.
“At present, foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua face new dangers: denial of a visa and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
Lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely restricted to Papua ' s immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands – requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “diverse and widespread violations” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have backed OPM in the past.
A representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramanat Nasir, reneged on the group's statement, telling journalists in Jakarta that “In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations”.
Locals want more foreign governments to focus on the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Netherlands Human Rights Ambassador, Kiis Van Bahar, visited Jayapur on 4 May, the local people broke the silence, saying, "We want freedom," as the source, who also attended the meeting but wanted to stay anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but the popes say they're unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
“Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting,” says Gobai, chairman of the tribe council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Paniai, apart from living in the shadow of a threat from the greedy army, are in poverty, and their education and health are in a miserable state.
Gobai says that the Paniai, like the other popuas, view their voice for Jokowi as a debt to be paid.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the last symbolic act of insubordination, burying the body of one of the victims on a plot of land in front of the police and the military station.
Knowing that justice may never be done, at least they will not let the guilty forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” says Jacobus without raising his head.
"What else were we supposed to do?"
The fire for the second time covers the Tubian skyscraper "Fakel"
The fire engulfed one of the world's highest skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of people to leave the 75-story structure 337 meters high.
This is the second fire in a high-rise building – which is by analogy called the "Fackel" – in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no operational news of the cause of the fire.
"We were sleeping and waking up from the fire alarms and people screaming.
We ran down the stairwell, and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” reuter told the agency a skyscraper called George.
According to the Department of Civil Defence of the city of Dubai, fire brigades extinguished the fire at about 4:00 local time (00:00 Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working on the provision of asylum to the victims.
The event can bring back to the agenda the security of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
In an investigation by the Fackel administration after the fire in 2015, it was found that the most affected was the cryout, the outer panels used to process and insulate.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the insulation system and the crippling panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could have accelerated the spread of the fire that had taken place there in June, killing about 80 people.
The growth in the Ida-Virumua tourist industry in June was minimal
As can be seen from the data that the mailer of the portal, rus.err.ee, received from the Department of Statistics, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists in June 2017, an increase of 125 or 0.6 per cent over the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has fallen and the number of foreign tourists has increased.
In June, for example, the foreign tours rose by 7.3% (544) to 7,994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists fell by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525.
The number of Russian tourists in the region has increased by 8.9 per cent, or 318, as compared to June 2016.
A total of 3,885 visitors from the Russian Federation stayed at the Ida Viruma Hotels in June 2017.
Andrej Malachov made it clear to the fans who were responsible for his departure.
Andrei Malakhov insinuated his fans at Instagram who was responsible for leaving Channel One.
So far, he has not commented on the rumours, but today he has posted a fragment of an article in the August 1 article of the report.
The picture Malakhov signed a "boss sucker" tag.
An article on how to prevent an employee from “burning out” and to pay attention to his or her condition.
Recall the many reports that the host was unable to find a common language with the new producer who was going to reformulate "Let 'em talk," it becomes clear what he so transparently insinuated, writes "CP".
Andrei Malakhov, a TV host, was reported to be on leave and had not signed an application for release from Channel 1.
The situation of dismissal can be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, a car bomb killed five soldiers
At least five soldiers died in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, transmitting the RIA News.
According to the police, a mined car exploded the night before the military roadblock in Girishk County.
We know about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new emergency took place in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked the exchange point.
The shooting between the assailants and the security forces is continuing.
Daver shot a shark in a video that bit his camera.
Dyver and a researcher, Greg Skomal, taped a video of a shark that bit his GoPro action camera.
The United States Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, with Scomal as a member of the United States Marine Fisheries Agency, has a role in Facebook.
The incident took place on August 2, at the shores of the Cape Code Peninsula in the North East of the United States, explaining the Necn Portal.
The man tried to take the shark off the camera he was holding on a special stick.
When a man was spotted, an animal more than three meters long swam up to him.
The shark started biting the camera, and he didn't try to attack the scientist.
Scomal explained that the predator did the same to determine whether the gadget was eaten.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also observed that such a marine animal behavior was new to scientists.
The reason for the massive fight in the Ural Military Center has become known.
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military Region arrived at the Yelan Training Centre, where a mass fight took place to investigate the incident.
Some details of this attack have already become known.
According to Mash, which appeared on the Vkontakte page, contractaries of U.S. military unit number 31612 had a brutal fight because of an unfilled bed.
Started with a private man named Sayan defying the officer's order to refill the sheet.
The officer was sided by soldiers from the sixth company.
Sayana supported the first company.
In a half an hour, 140 young men were smashed into beds and sinks in the barn, and the windows were smashed.
More than 10 people have been injured in a mass fight.
The CSO denied the information on scissors.
The study found that at least one fifth of the U.S. passengers are transporting prohibited items on a plane.
The study found that more than 20 per cent of airfarers knowingly or accidentally carried in their luggage on the plane through the U.S. Department of Transport Security check-ups, including at least 6 per cent getting on the plane without being viewed with illegal knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later found that they had accidentally possessed firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and covering over 1,000 people also revealed that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to fly with something that the ATB was not allowed to fly, 19.7 per cent were millennia, compared to less than 15 per cent of the X generation.
Members of the ATB are most likely to pass by with food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted to having been specifically screened for sharp items, while 2.2 per cent of the female and 3.7 per cent of the male respondents admitted to knowingly carrying illegal drugs on the plane.
The company stated that it was studying passengers all over the country to find out how many of them had accidentally been smuggled through an airport search, and how many had done so knowingly.
It is well expected that most often, knowingly or unconsciously, smugglers are the ones who fly the most.
According to the company, the ATB rules are rather complex and complicated.
People often don't know exactly what liquids they can transport or how much.
So it's not surprising that most of what the ATB picks up are banned liquids.
Some time ago, people thought the ATB might think it was illegal to move a book.
The liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Chapter EPA Prewitt has no intention of delaying the implementation of Obama ' s emission reduction rules
The day after the 15-state claim, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency overturned his decision to postpone the implementation of the Obama rules to reduce air-polluting and smog-induced emissions.
Prueitt explained his decision by the fact that his agency now listens more to the needs of state environmental regulators than in previous administrations.
He did not refer to a claim against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The argument was launched on 1 October, by which the States should meet the 2015 ozone standards at the land level.
In June, Prüitt announced that he would postpone their implementation for one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and to avoid “incompatibility with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Prewitt, who, before being appointed by President Trump to his current position, was the Attorney General of Oklahoma State, was long known as a consistent adversary to the stricter environmental standards.
After moving to Washington, D.C., he has repeatedly blocked or postponed the imposition of rules that the chemical or gas oil industry has opposed.
An unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal failure to return to Pewitt's old standards.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA had overstepped his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane spills.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, by abruptly altering the course for ozone standards, he was simply complying with the obligation of the EPA to cooperate with the states in an integrated process of implementing the new standards in a timely manner.
“In previous EPA administrations, it was often not possible to meet the time limit, then to expect claims from groups of activists and others, and to discuss the time frame in the course of the settlement of the case,” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen claims against EPA in his previous post.
"We do not believe in regulation through trials, and we take the time-limits seriously.
We also take seriously our statutes and the authority that it gives us."
However, the EPA statement states that Prewitt may at some point again use his “delaying powers and other statutory powers” to make sure that the rules of “jcyjdfys are on a clear course and on all available information”.
The Republicans in Congress are insisting on a wider revision of the ozone rules.
The bill, which was approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to postpone compliance with the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on the matter.
The New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states suing EPA this week, said that the group intended to continue legal pressure.
"The evolution of the EPA course - after our lawsuits - is an important win in the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who have been directly affected by the city, "Sneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone occurs when normal pollutants from machinery, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources react to the atmosphere with solar light.
The result can cause serious breathing problems in people who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health and environment advocates welcomed the unexpected change in Pruitt's course.
"It's hard to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from a man who's supposed to protect the air we're breathing," said Lori Ann Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the Trump administration's ideological campaign and to protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."
Congress IAAF extended the suspension of the All-Russia Federation of Light Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Light-Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russia Federation of Light-Athletics (UFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAAF WFL Reconstitution Board, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension be retained.
166 people voted for the extension of the suspension, vs. 21, handing over the TASS.
The IAAF board report stated that WFLA has made significant progress in meeting the conditions set by the re-membership board, but these conditions have not yet been fully met.
As a result of the VFL disqualifying at the London World Cup, Russian light-flyers were forced to take up a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to IAAF.
The WFLA was permanently disqualified by IAAF in 2015.
The report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was then published by Dick Rund, who spoke of a number of VADA violations committed by Russian officials and sportsmen.
For more information on the last report of the IAAF board, see the "IAAF extension of the WFL sanctions".
Ordinary failure
In the 3rd Tour of Fonbeth, Russia's Fonbeth, the Newoskian Chemiker played a field match against the FC Kaluga.
A little over 10 days ago, the rivals played in Russia's cup, but this time the picture of the game was quite different.
The Chemiker gave up to the opponent in no way, but the second-hand relaxation at the end of the match led to an offended goal and a fiasco.
After a recent fall from the Calujans with a score of :3 many prophesied in advance a simple victory for the masters.
Since the beginning of the meeting, however, the new Ukrainians have made themselves count and acted from the point of view of defence, but from the point of view of force.
In one inch, the ball was built up more and had the advantage of owning the ball.
A very good match was held by Alexei Syrotine, who repulsed the dangerous blows on a number of occasions and gave his partners confidence in his actions.
Sadly, the attack on the Chemic lacked the effort and the luck to put the Kalugi's defense to a dead end and to hit the first goal on the way out.
After the break, the game began to take place in counter-curricula.
The New Scouts have been more active in the attack.
Alarming calls for our team have been defensive errors that have allowed the Calujans to create a number of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the reunion, the Chemic seized the territorial advantage and carried out a number of dangerous attacks.
But the Calais' experience has played a role -- they've done the end in a more literate and cold-blooded way, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, the Chemiker turned the ball to the corner, the field owner, without resistance, was sent to the gate.
The goal was written by Yuri Dubrovin.
At the reporting meeting, the Chemiker showed a pretty good game, but he suffered an offended defeat.
Our team is still waiting for another departure: on 11 August, at 7 p.m., in Moscow, at the “Torpedo” Stadium of Edward Strieltsov, the New Soviets will fight with the Favorite of the “Centre” FC“ Ararat, composed of Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmaylov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come back to support "The Cheerios!"
The location and time of the meeting of the New Moscows is 6.30 p.m. outside the Magnolia shop (Ost, D.2, Corp.
Chemica: Syrotin, Manohin (k), Romachchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogya (Oreskin), Doudaiti, Rizov, St. Ivan, Belyan (Adojevtsev), Andreychenko (Ligin)

According to published decryptions of phone calls, Trump pressed Mexico about the payment of the border wall.
The Washington Post has published phone decryptions between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a phone call to the President of Mexico, Henrique Peña Niete Trump insisted that he stop publicly saying he would not pay for the planned wall on the border.
The U.S. President was talking to him about his public speech against the wall, and according to what he said, he said to him, "You can't talk to the press."
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the South American border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
His first phone call to the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was also deciphered, and there was a heated altercation.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the US was to receive the refugees on their way to Australia was “a funny,” “repulsive,” and“ dupes, ” and he insisted that, because of the agreement made by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot, as he intended to stop moving the refugees to the United States.
Trump finished the conversation, saying to Turnbull, "it was the most unpleasant talk of the day."
The bodies of the dead tourists in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane, owned by the Russian Airlines, carrying the bodies of the dead Russians in Abkhazia, left Sochi for St. Petersburg at 8:15 a.m. in Moscow time.
At the point of departure, the members of the ritual agency, as well as the city hall, will meet on the sidelines, and the Deputy Minister for resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia, Astamir Ahba, will tell the reporters.
In the past, representatives of the MES of the Republic stated that all the costs involved in the return of the bodies to Russia had been borne by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay the families of the deceased 500 000 roubles of compensation.
According to Ahba, the Abkhaz authorities have expressed their willingness to pay the family of the victims of the bombings to fly and live in the Republic, but the relatives have sent only the trusts to the Republic to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On 2 August, at about 4:20 p.m. Moscow time, two explosions took place in the village of Primorsky Goodoutsk in the Ministry of Defence ' s missile and artillery depot, after which large-calibre shells and other ammunition began to be detonated.
As a result, the warehouse was set on fire, causing unchecked shell explosions of various modifications.
As a result of an emergency, two Russian citizens, Helena Polakova, born in 1970, and Elena Timopheev, born in 1962, who were on vacation near a hydrogen sulfide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were taken to the health-care institutions of the Republic with varying degrees of severity.
There are currently seven people in the infirmary, the rest of whom have been discharged.
The study of the Russian influence on American elections will be done by a grand jury.
The Special Prosecutor for Russia, Robert Müller, has convened a grand jury in Washington, D.C., to study Russia's influence on the US President's election in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to interrogate witnesses under oath.
The material collected will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether it is sufficient to bring charges.
Calling a grand jury gives Mueller more authority to collect the evidence.
One of the subjects of the jury's investigation, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son at the time of the candidate for President Donald Trump with the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitsky.
In June 2016, Mueller himself promised to test the details of this meeting.
They've been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded his legal staff.
Trump Jr. used to say that he was waiting for a compromise on a candidate's headquarters from the Hillary Clinton Demparty, but there was no debugging document, and it was about adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr.'s statement of a meeting with Veselnitsky was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House said the president was not dictating anything, but he was just using his authority, as any father would have done.
Vice-Mary Penza was detained at work.
The Deputy Chief of Administration of Penza, Irina Shirchina, has been detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at her place of work, reporting to RIA News.
No formal reports have been received from the law enforcement authorities on this matter, but the UK Press Service has assured that they will follow up soon.
There's no comment on what's going on in the city hall of Penza.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has been in charge of urban planning and land relations since April 2015.
Prior to this, she has been the head of the Department of the Department of the Department of the Department of the Department of Internal Affairs of the Pensen Region for a long time.
Irina Shirzyna is bringing up three underage children, and it is remarkable that once again as a mother a year ago, she gave up her maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, Mexico has no launch vehicle or launch vehicle.
But there is a space agency set up in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bench is a tribute to the first man to be in space.
In contrast to the monuments of the Soviet period, which are being demolished in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin are, on the contrary, “pacing on the planet”.
In 2012, a monument was erected in American Houston near NASA's former headquarters.
In London, a monument on the Royal Observatory was erected to mark the 50th anniversary of the first flight to space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in Erfut, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The Monument in Karlov Varach, Czech Republic, has been spared the demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city centre to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th birthday of Gagarin, a monument to Jurios Gagarinsu appeared in Riga.
That's the name and name of the first spaceman in Latin, and he looks like he's 70 years old.
Murder at Morse Ford: The activists will lose the Lynch Courts on the stage to bring to justice
"Ford Mercury" in 1948 passed by the spectators in the village of Monroe, Georgia, and sniffed to a small Morse Ford Bridge.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver was on the way to the bridge, a group of white men with shotguns prevented it from moving.
The boss, a man of middle age in a suit in a thin strip, tucked in with a cigar and looked through the windshield.
The insiders trembled with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" the man murmured.
"Get him out of the car!"
The piercing outcry tore up the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Luckily, this terrible scene, which was played on 22 July, is just a mockery.
But when Roger was put on a noose on his neck, almost all the viewers really held their breath.
Since 2005, the activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to replay the night in 1946 when the dolls lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm, and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted of the murders.
"It's astonishing that no man has been arrested in all these years -- even though we see them next to us; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the play.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Georgia Congress, who has been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that the injustice has never been corrected.
"We want an investigation, we want an end, we want a cure, we want a reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he says.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of one of the lynching victims at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI records received by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of being involved in the lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been at large for decades, human rights defenders say that in the city, the two responsible vigilantes have always been well-known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ' s decision first allowed black citizens to vote on the prime that was due to take place in the summer.
About the same time, the FBI reported that black user Roger Malcolm punched Barnett Hester in a fight, a white landowner, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that according to rumours in the city, Hester was sleeping with his wife, Malcolm Dorothy, and that the kid she was supposed to have was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a big white landlord, paid $600 in bail to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove out of jail and got to the Morse Ford Bridge, a mob of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he has organized and directed the murders of Harrison," that is the conclusion in one of the FBI's reports.
"It is also clear that there was a collusion between state and city law enforcement agencies, who not only took part in the murders, but also destroyed the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt on the right to vote," he says.
"They've all been killed to send a message to blacks in the city: if you sign up and vote, you'll be the same."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Greene has been running an annual show that reproduces that lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her spectacle is observable, he grabs the viewer, and he's talking about the deep racism that many would like to think is no longer in America.
It's hard to see, and it's even harder to turn away, but Greene thinks it's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own ugliness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear what I've been through."
The rehearsal of this year began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors -- a dozen whites, the rest of the blacks -- met in the room and listened to a year-old review of the play.
Wade Marbo was a director with Greene.
He's been a major member of the clan for a few years, but he says it's not getting any easier.
"I think I'm dirty, because it's not the man I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story, because we don't want to go back at the time."
In the room, actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Ruscone, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, are repeating their roles.
Spectal begins with Malcolm, angered by the fact that Hester is sleeping with his wife, Dorothy, yelling and pushing.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
She's yelling back at Ruscon.
There's a hit.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all black actors) is fascinated with a laugh.
Green laughs the hardest.
"What is it," asks Ascon.
He's concerned and embarrassed.
Am I overreacting?
"No," says Greene through the laughter.
"I just don't think the white people used to say 'nigga'."
"Yes, yes," laughs one of the black performers.
"You have to say hard 'r'."
And so the energy in the room changes, and the discomfort changes the sense of partnership.
Everyone has to do the right thing, not just for the play, but for the memory of the four dead.
The scene starts over.
This time, when Ruscona speaks the word "n," it's clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
The spectacle ends brutally and fast.
Shouting, shots, and then quiet.
A woman in black mourning dress stands over the bodies of the actors and sings Billy Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
Hundred yards away, half the viewers are wiped out of their eyes with tears and sweat.
There's almost the same number of blacks and whites among the viewers.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to watch the show; many live very close.
They all endured Georgia's heavy perfume for almost eight hours while Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
So far, the murder has been history, but now that they're standing in the same place where people are lynching, it's like their ghosts are in the air right now.
When the last note of the song is quiet, Greene invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
The kids bend to their heads, touch the blood paint, and the still-bodied bodies, and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy murmuring, as if to remind himself of it.
In a few minutes, Greene thanks the audience, and all of a sudden it's over.
Actors drop strings off their necks and wipe out their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, a man in a suit who played the main doll.
Nick Ruscone hugs the other two and then, weeping, falls into their arms: the emotional stress of the show finally hit him.
"It's all right," whispers one of the women.
"We know you have a good heart.
You've got a reason for this."
Later, the audience sits down for dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta are talking lively about the black couple they just met.
Denisa Daplinski has a hard time looking for words to describe how she feels after the show.
"It's hard to listen to these terrible, terrible words, and actions... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"Next I think the lynchings are still happening," she adds, "but now it's called what the police are shooting."
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender for food, has taken the spotlight.
He says he's already planning next year's presentation.
"The play is encouraging us, because it not only describes the horror of what we have been through, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not learn their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
The court fined navalny for the "Agitation Sabbath" violations.
The Simone Court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny 300,000 roubles for violating the organization of the rally.
The opponent was found guilty of an administrative offence under article 20.2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, “Recurrence of the organization of the meeting”.
Previously, Judge Hizir Moussakaev of the Simonovsky Court of Moscow completed the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, Chief of Staff of the Opposition, Alexei Navalny, who was brought to justice under the same article as Navalny.
Volkoff was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In this amount, Judge Moussakayev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the “agitation Sabbath”, which the supporters of Navalny held in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
Upon seeing the agitated material, the officers following the Sabbath was of the view that the organizers of the event had deliberately concealed its true nature, a public action (for which permission must be sought from the capital authorities in advance).
Leonid Volkov and his attorneys Ivan Jedanov and Alexander Anointev applied for an administrative stay on account of the absence of an offence and indicated that the police had made a number of errors in the drafting of the report.
On the very “agitational Sabbath”, Volkoff was not detained, but he received a summons to report to the police station on an event with his active participation.
The same subpoena was given to Navany and another fellow oppositionist, Nikolai Laskin.
In Mordovia, a man who shot the bride and three wedding guests was arrested.
The court in Mordovia arrested a local who shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported to the National Office of the Investigative Committee.
The incident took place on the evening of July 29.
In an argument, a 42-year-old man in Saranska shot several times at the guests of the event who had come to the village pond to take a bath.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been brought under article 213 (1) (a) of the Criminal Code, article 30 (3) of the Criminal Code, and article 105 (2) (a), (e), (and) of the Criminal Code, “Attempt to kill two or more persons in a manner of common danger, for hooliganism”).
According to Interfax, the local media reported that a man had opened a fire because the wedding guests decided to take a bath in the area to the water.
Minergo will tighten the requirements for turbine suppliers for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, such as turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines, hydroelectric turbines, refineries and oil production are launched, the equipment suppliers will be required to share data on access with Minergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The Government ' s draft resolution has already been ready for public discussion.
The new requirements will cover only the “critically important energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
The document identified potential threats such as the acquisition of information and access to the management of an object by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and entities, bad-faith partners and hackers.
The EU has expanded anti-Russia sanctions due to Siemens
On August 4, the EU Press Service stated that the anti-Russia sanctions had been extended due to the Simens Turbines incident in Crimea.
This has been previously reported by the "Argument of the week."
The EU Council Press Service stated that the sanctions against the Russian Federation had been extended due to the Simens Turbines scandal, which had allegedly been brought to Crimea bypassing the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
It has been previously reported that the final decision will be taken before the end of the day, and the decision has been made, and the sanctions against Russia have been extended.
Pearson is shortening an extra 3,000 jobs and shortening dividends to get business back to life.
On Friday, a British educational group, Pearson, announced that it would reduce an additional 3,000 jobs and reduce the pre-paid dividend by 72 per cent in connection with the start of a new restructuring programme to address the problems facing their business.
These job cuts, which, according to John Fallon's head of company, will mostly take place at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, are in addition to the 4,000 jobs that were shortened during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it was planning to cut the cost by another £300 million (US$394 million) in May under a third cost-cutting program to try to bring back the business that was hit by the fast transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said that its annual forecasts remained constant after it announced an increase of 1 per cent in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: a soldier, Nato, was killed by a suicide bomber
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, as the NATO report states.
According to unsubstantiated local data, the incident in the city of Karabakh also resulted in the death of three civilians.
This explosion is the last one that hit Afghanistan this month in the bloodbath: on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the attack on Thursday night occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by an “improved man-to-man explosive device”.
All the wounded are reported to be in a stable state and to be treated at the United States Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
Respondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabagh is the main source of concern for NATO forces stationed in the vicinity of Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomber in a car caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed to have carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion in the center of the city killed more than 150 people – the country’s most serious number of human casualties since the United States-led military withdrew the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the unreliable situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump assesses whether there is a need to increase the number of U.S. troops and police in the country.
According to correspondents, the attacks in Kabul over the past weeks have also created a crisis of public trust in the Government, its course of conduct, and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Gani.
Environmental Protection Agency, after legal action, overturns the decision to defer the air pollution law
The American Environment Agency has overturned the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama-era law, which requires states to limit air-polluting emissions one day after 15 states have sued the agency for this step.
On the evening of Wednesday, the Environment Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “Ozone 2015 measurements”, stressing that this step showed the agency’s willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with and sensitivity to our state partners,” said the head of the Environment Agency, Scott Prewitt.
In June, Prüitt announced the intention of the Environment Agency to postpone the measurement of ozone, where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced in order to meet stricter air purity standards, by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, for the most part democratic, along with the Federal District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit alleging that this intention was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to reverse the wide range of environmental regulations introduced by the previous President, Barack Obama, as part of a wider programme aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has led to resistance on the part of the Democrats and the environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of high-emissions on the health of the population.
The Web site of the Environment Agency states that the use of air for breath containing ozone “can worsen the function of the lungs and increase the respiratory symptoms”, such as as asthma.
The European Business Association has opposed new anti-Russia sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with the US economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
In the view of AEB, such measures can result in a serious reduction in the production and number of jobs.
The AEB statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, so free trade cannot be restricted.
The European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of State and Government of the EU, the US, and Russia to work out a new course of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
The MPs ask the police to limit traffic at the Pskov Bay.
The Pskov People ' s Choices sent a message to the UMD Chief of the City of Sergei Surin on the problem of the movement of the Great River River.
Members of the gorduum, Konstantin Bolotin, Gregory of the Party, and Valery Lesnikov, believe that motorists are hindering people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, the control of drivers would help to make the area more secure and secure.
The problem is that intruders ignore the sign of the "Footway" and are free to go on the sidelines.
As a result, major repairs and improvements have been carried out in vain.
The sports and playgrounds are getting inconvenient because of the car.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, the central coastline is patrolled in the evenings by the PPP and the maids.
As a result, the number of motorized vehicles has been reduced, but the traffic has not been stopped.
Putin ordered the investigating authorities not to pick up hard disks.
Russia’s President, Wladimir Poetin, has proposed that the investigating authorities not be allowed to detain servers and hard disks from the company’s desktops.
The Head of State stated this at the meeting on investment programmes in the Far East.
According to the President, “the application of measures leading to the suspension of business activities, including the removal of hard disks from desktops and servers, in the interest of the investigation should be eliminated”.
Putin noted that, if the investigators need to do so, “it is sufficient to remove the copies, to assure them and to use them in the course of the investigation”.
The Head of State added that no “conditions should be created to prevent the continuation of the business up to the impossibility of paying taxes”.
Olga Bouzova told me how much she wanted to call her ex-husband.
Olga Bouzova, a TV talker, admitted that she wanted to call her ex-husband, Dmitri Tarasov.
The celebrity is now in the United States, where he is working.
Just the day before, Olga went to Las Vegas, after which she decided to publish a post on the Instagram social network.
She reported that she had not been married, had not made any new tattoos, and had not called her ex-husband to say that he had ruined her life, even though she wanted to do so very much.
Bouzova said she'd remember this trip forever, because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played Cornelius Fadge, the Minister of Magic, in screening a series of Harry Potter novels, died in 1992.
This was reported by the Independent on Thursday.
His family told him about the actor's death.
According to them, he lived a life of great success in film, theatre and TV in 70 years of his career.
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort city of Cheltenham.
He played with Lawrence Olivier in the Coriolan Tragedy in 1959 at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.
Hardy was also reminiscent of the role played by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of Agatha Christie's screenshots of Miss Marple.
For his role as Churchill in the BBC "Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years" (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Film and Television (BAFTA) award.
Robert Hardy has also been the President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, on several occasions.
Something in the Danish state was rotting: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean Andre, Count de Laborde, refused to be buried with her venerable wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, it's a golden wedding, but on the agenda of a couple, it's not about getting ready for a party, it's about a rich argument.
His highness has renounced the title of the consort Prince, and he has offended the Queen that she has never won the title of the consort king.
Henrik lives in France, although he is the wife of the Queen.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia called on Washington to stop whining at Moscow
In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, the Russian Federation responded to Mike Pence's remarks, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkan.
The relevant statement by the foreign policy office was circulated some time ago.
In its comments, the MFA indicated that the United States is increasingly using cold-war strains, which are inadequate to the current reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the United States authorities to stop taunting the Russian Federation.
As "Arguments of the week" was written the day before, US Vice-President Mike Pence accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Western Balkan and organizing a failed government in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko are dating for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive match.
Basili Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seem to be moving steadily towards the most exciting boxing match of up to £147 in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the office spaces of the ESPN Channel in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unfailing lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, passed the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's second half-weight champion.
After the unanimous victory of Garcia over the former four-weight world champion, Erian Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both boxers are among the top five boxers, no matter what the weights.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Miguel Marriga on Saturday at 7 p.m. on the ESPN channel.
When the boxers were posing for the picture, the manager of Lomachenko Egis Climas noticed that the potential decisive fight between them would be the right thing to do.
"I used to be half-weighted," he recalled.
"I'm up for the Broner category [up to £140], but I'm not that big.
I'm a bit small for 140.
I want to go down to half light.
And he needs to get up to a half-fifty-fifty, and then we'll have a fight.
That's what fans want.
Let's do this to them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boks needs this match."
Climas asked if the fight should be aired through PPV, as part of the strategy he is pursuing for Lomachenko to hold his debut match at a weight of 135 later in the year to set up a meeting with Garcia (37-0,30 knockouts) next summer, who is also interested in fighting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the title of the world champion in lightweight in the arena of the Forum on 23 September.
“The fight may be at the PPV, because all the fans have asked for it,” said Garcia, expressing later a willingness to fight the channel that offers the best financial conditions.
"We are the main names.
No other names will be of such interest.
As soon as they're ready... "
Garcia said he considered Lomachenko to be a "scene boxer" and might attend his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko didn't start to laud Garcia right away, and he said he thought the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... you begged for a knockout."
Garcia said he was focused on showing the force of the hit, and then boxing.
They both said that they felt the tension was on the rise before their own match.
“This fight must take place.
No other fight is so much of an interest and talk.
I am more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for one of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It's gonna be a great fight."
On a few central streets, Moscow will be shut down for the weekend.
On this weekend, on 5 and 6 August, the movement will be restricted in the capital on the section of Tver Street from the Nastasian alley to the Triumph Square, as well as on the 1st Tver-Yama Street.
In addition, the road will be closed on the Leningrad Prospect, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tver-Yama Street.
At all sites, the overlap will be on both sides, as reported by the Transport Department Information Centre in Moscow.
The streets will be closed from midnight on 5 August to 5 a.m. on 7 August, due to improvements.
Also during the weekend, traffic will be closed on the section of the Moscow River.
It's still building the Charging Park.
Poetin commissioned the Attorney General to check on the Baykal.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Poetin, has instructed the Office of the Attorney-General of the Russian Federation to check the territory of Baikal for illegal and ecologically harmful activities.
“Request the Office of the Attorney-General to check the Baykal territory for illegal and ecologically harmful activities”, stated Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the environmental development of the region.
In addition, the Russian leader has asked for action if the facts of the violations are to be found.
New test results for the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden have been published
Recent tests of asylum-seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new method of medical age assessment, show that more than 80 per cent of the testees have been assessed as over 18 years of age, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of the test.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicanalverket) began testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age of the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the real age of some of the refugees who claimed to be underage.
So far, MIGRATIONverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensics agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of the test was estimated to be 18 or over, and in 25 more cases, the forensics agency estimated that the test was "probably 18 or over".
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the man was “probably less than 18”.
Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of a person is questionable.
According to Johan Guernsson of the Forensics Agency, the results are consistent with those of the past months.
“We don't see much difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite the same,” he said to The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which persons have been assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that the asylum-seeker has lied about his or her age.
In May, the agency published 581 test results and reported that in 442 cases, “the nearest age of the test is 18 years or more.
However, after 581 of the results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, a man had publicly stated that he was 18 years old.
The method of medical age assessment, which is to x-ray the tooths of wisdom and tomography of the knee joints and to give it to dentists and radiologists, has also led to criticism in some bodies.
One of the skeptics is endocrinologist from the Caroline Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have been through puberty before or after normal.
"I've got reason to think about it, and I don't think we need to use the means of measurement that we're using now.
The biological age is thus very imprecise.
If we can't define it with certainty, we don't have to pretend what we can," he said to the newspaper “Metro.
But Göransen, from the forensics agency, argued in favour of the test's accuracy: "In general, it can be said that the risk of mistaking a child as an adult is small.
We face the greatest risk when a man is about 18 years old, in which case he is about 10 per cent.
I'll see if I can run for the presidency.
During his work trip to Buryatia, Wladimir Poetin wanted to see if he could run for the presidency of Russia in 2018, he was handing out Interfax.
The application was a response to a request from the people of the village of Turemushka oblast of Buryatsk.
In a video conference on the elimination of the fire in Buritia and Irkutsk oblast, the interviewer asked Putin to say, "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election is held, we all ask you to run for this office again."
"Okay, I'll think about it, thank you," the President replied.
On 28 July, President Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary of Russia, commented on some media statements that Vladimir Putin's election headquarters would be headed by the head of the administration of the Russian Federation, Anton Wyno.
Sandov called these assumptions "nothing on the baseless, hypothetical reasoning."
"As long as there are no headquarters, until the creation of the headquarters is far, far from the campaign," said Sandov.
"Until it's on the agenda," said Sandov.
The Governor of West Virginia said he was moving to another party.
The Governor of West Virginia, a Democratic Party representative, Jim Justiz, announced on Thursday, during a meeting with President Trump, that he was moving to another party.
“Do you like it or not, but the Democrats have drifted away from me,” said Governor Justice.
“Today I speak to you with many prayers and many reflections... today I say to you, to the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of any use to you as a Democratic Governor.”
The meeting exploded with applause.
“So I will change my registration to a Republican tomorrow,” Justice added.
"As a trainer, I'd tell you that the time to play is different."
Trump had earlier promised that an important statement would be made at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia with a 42-per-cent win, and Justice didn't support the Democratic Party candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement on Thursday evening that “the transfer of Governor Justice to another party is another attack on the Democratic Party, which is more of a hindrance than is working to make our country big again.”
“Bearing in mind the 15 governors and controlling the lowest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice’s statement is just another renunciation of a party that has no top-down leaders and is not able to find a positive, unifying message,” reported CBS News, a representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronna McDaniel.
Cartoon cat by the name of Mr. Beauty found the house thanks to social media.
A pet in Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., built a cat named Mr. Belle, who weighs more than 14 kg, after he became famous on the Internet.
This is reported by Massable.
At the end of June, a picture of a cat was published on Facebook, asking to find his owner, because "it's obviously someone who used to feed him."
In the comments, users noted that an animal's face can be a new meme.
The press has gained more than 3.2 thousand liquor and 15,000 comments.
In their comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to take Mr. Beauty's place.
As a result, it was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to take over her weight.
In an interview on WNCN radio, an American woman said she had had a similar experience: she took a cat about 10 kg home, and now she weighs a little over five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
A post with an animal's picture has gathered more than 68,000 views.
The commentators noted that she could have made a career in the model business.
Coy lauded Russia's “really” apology for the doping scandal
The international athletic athletic expert Sebastian Coe lauded on Thursday what he called a sincere apology from Russia in connection with a doping scandal, but he reiterated that this was not the time to let the country back in sports.
The Russian representative of the Light Athletics Federation, Dmitri Schlachtin, informed the Congress of the International Association of Light Athletics Federations, which was held on the eve of the World Cup in Light Athletics, that it was fair to suspend his country from sports and that he was determined to combat doping.
He apologized to "all the athletes who stole gold and silver medals at the competitions."
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Light-Athletics Federations voted to retain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the evidence of State-funded use of doping.
“I thought today's answer, today's report was very frank,” said the President of the International Association of Light-Athletics Federations Cow to the reporters.
“All the council and all the Congress loved... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it has been a very hot time and is now doing everything in its power to take care of the reconfiguration of the Federation.”
Coe said he also “liked” that Russia accepted the criteria for its reconstruction.
“I think it was a very constructive day and we are moving forward, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission, according to which this is not the time to reinstate Russia,” Koe said.
“In the next few months, we must do everything we can to deal with this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate pure athletes from the stainted system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Light-Athletics Federations, will take part under a neutral flag in the World Cup of Light Athletics, which will start on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Light-Athletics Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements still needed to be met for Russia to recover.
He told reporters in London, following a report on the International Association of Athletics Federations Board, that drug testing was still not done in sufficient volume, and that the renegade coaches were still doing their job quietly.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason.
Reporter Basili Muravitski, who was detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SSA), was sent to the Security Service for a period of two months.
A member of the Gitomir Journal of the Internet is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and attacking Ukraine's territorial integrity.
At the same time, Russia does not support the actions of the Ukrainian authorities against a journalist, considering it a “barbaric policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the European migration crisis, Italy decided to make a restricted military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
The commandant of Borsini, a patrol ship, entered the territorial waters of Libya in order to, together with the navy of that country, halt the flow of illegal migrants.
The decision to start the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome has agreed on it with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which, however, has no control over most of the country ' s territory.
The opposing Cabinet and the Libyan Parliament, based in Tobrooke, accused Italy of violating the sovereignty of Libya.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to resist Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they stated that they do not believe in those threats and that they intend to send another warship to the Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in the negotiations between Italian Premier Paulo Gentoli and the head of the recognized European cabinet of Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities went to the establishment of a maritime mission to combat illegal migration, following the release in July of statistics on the number of illegals coming from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The Government had stated that resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.
Scalable failure occurred in Skype
A global failure in Skype's service was recorded today in a number of countries.
On Thursday, 3 August, users began to send massive complaints to the program's developers.
In Microsoft, experts have already been working hard to address the problems faced by Europeans and North Americans, explaining the RIA News.
Let us recall that Skype also failed in June of this year.
Users have been unable to receive and send messages for some time.
The two leaders of Ukraine's Light Athletics have been suspended from participating in the CM.
Olga Grounder and Olesha Powkh, specializing in short-distance races, have been excluded from the Ukrainian team for the World Cup in London.
This is reported on the National Federation of Light Athletics (FLAU) website.
This decision was taken by the organization in connection with the initiation by the International Association of Light-Athletics Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings against light-age children.
Trainer Sergey Basenko was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF is a suspect of doping.
Phox is the bronze prize of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Cup, the 2010 European champion of the 4-100-metre relay, and the 2012 European Chief of State of the Earth is the winner of the 2012 European first in the 4-4-400-metre relay.
The London World Athletics Championship will be held from August 4 to August 13.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neimar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not interfere with the world record transfer of Neimar from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris St. Germain.
Whatever the impact may be on the chain, the UEFA’s Paris St. Germain, the European football authority, in whose power it is to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious League of Champions tournament.
From the Financial Fairplay rules introduced by UEFA in 2011, it is clear that the SWS will eventually have to show that Neimar's transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million Euros (US$ 262 million) just to get the Brazilian out of the contract, and Naymar will receive a wage that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neimar's move to France.
SVU can make a lot of money to hire Neimar and add him to the other stars' galaxies, given the financing of the team from the rich energy of the ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums of money on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legal sources of income to reach the profitability threshold in their football business.
FFP introduced Michelle Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that the clubs, in their quest for success, were in fact swindling and risking ruin if the banks or owners were to stop financing.
In 2011, FFP ceased to focus on the debt of the clubs and instead shifted to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change in the business model, originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential, and then to spend a lot of time to improve the team and create a global brand – it has become a difficult plan to implement.
For the current three-year period, the 2018 valuation can cost 30 million Euros.
And even though Platini was dishonorably removed from his office in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to contain the excesses.
“FFP must be alive, and as we move forward, we will tighten the rules,” Andrea Traverso, an associate press agency in UEFA, said last week.
Even though SGW will pay the buy-in of Neumar's one-time contract, he can distribute this amount for the full duration of his contract.
Naymar has signed a five-year contract so that the transfer value can be shown in the annual report as a cost of 44.4 million Euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were imposed on SWF, as well as on Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
SGW was fined 60 million Euros (at that rate of $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million Euros, and was ordered to limit its team to the League of Champions in the 2014–1015 season to 21 Players instead of normal 25.
UEFA is monitoring clubs that can try to outsmart its financial inspections by blowing up their profits from companies associated with the club's owners.
Although a Qatari company might have been able to offer SWG, if the amount of funding had been considered to be above the standard market rate, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered a legal income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that the sum of funding for SWAP from the Tourism Authority of Qatar was up.
It has been reported that some of Naymar's earnings in the SVP may have been paid by the 2022 World Cup Organization Committee in Qatar.
But SVU and Qatar-2022 deny that Neimar will be an ambassador to the World Cup, and such a maneuver could easily be found by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on the SVU means that UEFA will be more closely following any attempt to bypass the rules.
On Thursday, people who were familiar with the situation reported that UEFA did not have a preliminary discussion with SVU about the Neimar transfer.
They spoke to the Associated Press on an anonym basis, as they were not authorised to discuss the situation of SWS.
According to the most recent report, SGW earned more than 10 million Euros in the period 2015 to 1016 with a turnover of 542.4 million Euros.
The account for the last fiscal year has not yet been published.
SGW expects that the arrival of Neimar will be a good place for sponsorship, the sale of attributes, and T-shirts with the team's logo.
At the club, it is assumed that the turnover will grow by at least 30 per cent as a result of a new player.
Undoubtedly angered by the fact that one of the best footballers was leaving, the Spanish league tried to prevent the transfer of Neimar, claiming that the SVU would violate the financial fair play.
“This is an obvious case of `financial doping', with the club and the state,” said the Spanish newspaper AS, President La League Javier Tebas, in view of the fact that the ultimate owner of the SWG is Qatar.
Arsen Wenger, who owns an American sports magnate, shares La League's doubts about the state's funding of the club.
"These are all the consequences of equity, and this has completely changed the landscape of football in the last 15 years," he said on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It's getting very hard to stick to a financial fair play, because a country can have a lot of ways and a lot of reasons to be represented by such a big player.
The President will decide the order and place of the swearing-in.
Where and as new Russian citizens will swear their allegiance to the Russian Federation, the President will decide - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law have drawn up a State Duma committee on legislation and Statehood.
A week ago, the deputies planned to make a direct determination of the manner in which the law would swear.
Children under the age of 18 will be released from the solemn oath, as well as incapacitated children, as follows from the updated text of the amendments to the draft law “On the nationality of the Russian Federation”, which the Committee will consider before the second reading on 11 July at its meeting.
The idea of swearing an oath to become a national of the Russian Federation instead of a formal signature of the documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on 6 June in a meeting with the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Woldin.
The members of the Parliament have formulated this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill to repeal the decision to grant citizenship to those who have subsequently been convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public appeals to terrorism or for its public justification in the media or on the Internet (art. 205.2, para. 2, of the Criminal Code), as well as for the hijacking of a plane, train or water transport, but only in the case of terrorism (art. 211, para. 4, of the Code).
According to the bill, his logic was as follows: by issuing citizenship documents, a person is bound by a promise to comply with Russian law - by taking the path of extremism, he is in breach of that promise.
The bill in April was introduced in the State Duma by the leaders of the Douma factions, Vladimir Vasiliev (Union Russia), Genady Zyuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov (Just Russia) and the Speaker of the DG Viacheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the deputies adopted it on first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State and Law approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but it has now been redrafted.
It now states that the President of the Russian Federation will set the order of the swearing-in.
Parliamentarians had previously intended to describe the procedure directly in the Russian Federation Citizenship Act, stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting in front of the State seal and the Russian flag in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event was to take place - the list of places where the Russian Federation ' s stamp was possible was regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include the courts, the offices of the heads of State of the entities, the municipalities, the judges, the prosecutors, the heads of the federal executive, etc.
It's more likely to be a registrar.
The swearing of a solemn oath to be a national of the Russian Federation will take place after the officials have checked their documents.
But the Russian passport is only given after the oath has been given, and the text has been refined.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn in from the age of 18, not from the age of 14.
The rule that incompetent or restricted persons, as well as those who cannot deliver, read, or sign the text of the oath by their own hand, will be maintained.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to release from this procedure and “other persons”,
The updated bill also sets out a special procedure for the admission to Russian citizens of Ukraine, who are considered to be Russian-language speakers.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting an application to the authorized body of Ukraine for that purpose.
A notarized copy of the application will have to be handed over to Russian officials.
Rejection of “alien” nationality, as it is, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible “for reasons beyond the control of the individual”.
A group of deputies, including the First Vice-Speaker of the DG Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Kovlinsky, Pavel Krascheninnikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all “One Russia”), proposed an amendment to the Act.
I think many of you know it's not possible to get a certificate from Ukraine, it's just impossible.
So there are a lot of people waiting for their fate to decide about the Russian Federation's citizenship, as the head of the Domesian Committee on State and Law, Pavel Kraschennikov (ER), explained the previous day.
In addition, it has been made clear in the text that the restrictions on the holding of certain posts for foreigners will not apply to those who have given up their “other” citizenship in writing and have handed over their previous passport to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, but “for reasons beyond their control” have not ceased to be considered a national of another country.
It is now prohibited for foreigners to hold positions in the municipal service, to be employed in facilities and in organizations whose activities are related to Russia ' s security.
Also, a person with a dual nationality or a residence permit in another country may not become a member of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
The law was scheduled to enter into force on 1 September 2017, and the necessary by-laws should be ready by that time.
Nostalgia is becoming a niche in "The Hot American Fly" and "Detective Companion"
The current iteration of history is nostalgic at the same time as the glorious days of the characters in the 1980s; the era of the grunge in the 1990s (sometimes at a time when the outstanding Masters David Wayne and Michael Schovalter made a comedy of "the State" for MTV); and themselves - that is, the year 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poler, and Paul Rudd, went to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the elevation and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems anachronistic.
"The First Day of the Camp" was surprisingly good, and not just because of absurd humor (including the original story of a talking can of vegetables, which was echoed by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned kids who have just reached the age of majority, making it a part of the joke.
"Ten years later", where adults have played adults, have less emotional roots, and its parody is more unsystemic, and includes riffs from the 1990s 's Stalking Cradle Hands.
In one episode, the character is getting Apple Powerbook, four-wheel roller skates, and "a lot of other things from 1991".
A lot of narrative moves are the same.
Good-hearted Coop (Showalter), now a writer, still has not won any reciprocation from Cathy (Marguerite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) still has his virginity.
And there's a crazy and vile conspiracy in which Ronald Reagan (also Showalter) is involved, now instigated by George Bush Sr. (professed by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is to step away from it.
It's particularly funny to see a young Rudd who sings Matt Dillon's single song, a character who, Andy's old man, is now an old man.
To make this franchise a success would be random madness in the spirit of a recursive show called Seven Up, until it reaches what I think would have been a logical end to it: "A hot American summer: 20 years later," where in the last scene the entire company would go to a movie at the premiere of the movie "The Hot American Summer."
The "Detective Companion" in the Amazon addresses another type of nostalgia: the memory of the American Cold War, the "Blond Explorer" or even the "Glass" with her images of the East-West struggle.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Regisseur Riz Thomas, is a TV movie: a Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheism, and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The main roles - who saw the life of Gregor and the idealist Joseph - are played by Florin Pierresick, Jr., and Cornelio Ulice, and their dialogues in English, Channing Tatum, who is also an executive producer, and Joseph Gordon-Levite.
That's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are a number of visual jokes (policies spend time watching a game of chess, how Americans can watch football).
The band of famous voices behind the frame, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and chloe sevigny, makes it fun to play "puzzle the voice."
But "Comrade Detective" is so sticking to the plausible clumsy propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in a Ronald Reagan mask -- that's what it often looks like.
Six long episodes are long, and it's funny not very often.
If it were shortened, "Comrade Detective" could better deal with his satire in the spirit of agit prop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph go to the American embassy, there are two fat people in the lobby, absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
An imaginary comunist viewer, this image tells us that Western culture can do anything to make obesity.
The fictional Romanian writers of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and so do they.
The award for the Russian Super Bowl football match between Spartak and Locomotive will be about 30 million roubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (FFL), Sergey Prukin, at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of the sum, RT reports.
He also added that, to date, there are few more tickets to the match.
The Spartacus-Locomotive match will take place on Friday, 14th of July, at 9:30.
According to TASS, Spartacus is an active champion of the Russian Federation, and the Locomotive is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young occupiers cleaned up the furniture shop for 200,000 roubles.
The other day, a 37-year-old Ufiman with a furniture firm approached the police.
The man claimed theft of expensive tools from the shop, causing serious damage to his production.
The miners have become instruments with a total value of almost 200,000 roubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulics, a winch.
The guards of the police began to search for the criminals and soon came to the inhabitants of Bashcortostan, 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, the collaborators infiltrated the company, broke into the front door and removed the tools.
Right after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first car service they found.
A case of theft has already been brought against them, and the law enforcement officers have been able to return only a part of the stolen instruments to the rightful owner.
State Department commented on Medvedev's comments on the relations between the Russian Federation and the United States
The US and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State Department, Heather Nauert, in response to the statement made by the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, on the relationship of the two States.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government stated that, by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the US put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared the Russian Federation a full-blown trade war.
Commenting on those words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a “lower level”, but noted that there was a need to look for “areas for interaction”.
"Look at the peace in the southwest of Syria, which has been in effect for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," quotes the diplomat RIA News.
At the same time, a representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the statement of the Russian Premier that sanctions amounted to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was signed by US President Donald Trump last Wednesday.
At the same time, he acknowledged that the document was a failure and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "created" roses of amethysts and quartz
The jewellery unit of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - added to Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
There are five new rings and three rings of roller tapes.
In the Rose Dior Pré Catelan line, two new rings and a necklace of amethysts, pink quartz, and diamonds were produced in glyptics (man-made stone-smart) and passives to mark the 70th birthday of the home.
Dior Joaillerie Victoire de Castellan was inspired by the roses that the designer Christian Dior, in his estate in Granville, and by the Bugatell and Pre-Catelan Paris Gardens.
Trump found the perpetrators of the deterioration of relations with Russia
President Donald Trump of the United States made a strong criticism of Congressional members.
In the view of the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relationship with Russia is at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
"Can you thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," the president tweeted.
On the eve of the day, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
They will, in particular, affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House subsequently issued a statement by the President, in which he indicated that the law would not allow the United States to make lucrative deals and would bring the Russian Federation, China, and North Korea closer together.
A Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy a Ukrainian daughter, Sberbank.
An entrepreneur from Belarus, Victor Prokopenja, withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for a subsidiary of the Sberbank.
The businessman explained to RBC his intention to “concentrate on our other planned investments and projects on which we are working”.
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a move would be "the best investment in time" despite the investment attraction of buying the Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenia became the main bidder for a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the NorvikBank consortia Gregory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Guceriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Peter Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One such financial organization, in addition to the TSA and the External Bank, became Sberbank.
Novac gave the reason for the blackout in Crimea.
The reason for the blackout in Crimea has been identified by the Russian Ministry of Energy.
Alexander Nowak, the head of the department, made an explanation of the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was powerless due to an accident in Krasnodar territory.
The truck in the accident hit the power lines and the Cuban and related Crimea networks were deactivated.
The power failure in the major Crimean cities was recorded last week.
The technicians have rectified the malfunction within hours.
Initially, blackout could have been caused by an anomalous heat.
Bank of England will keep the interest rate at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have led the rumours of possible upturns to abate.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will be slow, and has left interest rates unaltered in the growing pressure on family income.
The Bank ' s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with 6 to 2 to keep the rate at 0.25 per cent, with a smaller number of members in favor of an increase in the rate this month, because weak economic growth has weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank restricted its projections to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018, and warned that the pressure on family income would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in the fall.
The bank, however, cautioned that an increase in the rate in the next few years would be necessary to control the inflation caused by the crisis, and stated that it was likely that the cost of the loans would have to be raised more than was expected in the financial markets.
The members of the committee also voted to give up part of the immense set of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of breczyte.
Beginning next February, the bank will shut down an emergency financing plan for which it provides banks with low-cost loans, even though it has announced that it now has to provide an additional 15 billion quid – up to 115 billion.
In the billing protocol, the bank said: “According to the MPC’s main forecasts, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) has been slow in the near future, while the pressure on real family incomes continues to affect consumption.”
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that to halt inflation, it would take “severe tightening of financial policies” at a “slightly more” level than the markets expect.
Now, the markets are predicting the first upturn in the third quarter of next year, and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all the promotions would be “progressive” and “limited. ”
The bank's projections for this and the following year are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank left its forecast at 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After the news, the sterling fell relative to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to Euro1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent discouraging growth rate was weakened by an increased expectation of growth; then GDP rose by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, as compared to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the bank’s representative, growth is likely to stay at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to grow a bit later in the year.
The bank’s last report on inflation gave little reason for the joy of the households that have been hit by high inflation and very low wage hikes: according to the bank, the pressure will increase before it drops.
The Bank added that the financial policy “can't prevent” the wage-earnings in the next few years, but it expects that the wages will be “significantly” restored by the end of its three-year prognosis.
The economy is also determined to grow as a result of the growing demand for British goods, due to the low rate of the pound, which offsets part of the lower consumer spending.
The decision was taken a year after last August's rate was reduced to 0.25 per cent after the shocking results of the EU exit referendum, which led to a drop in the pound.
The Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last decision on the rate, there was an upsurge in the scope of the proposed rate rise, as inflation was under pressure on already under pressure, with three committee specialists asking for an increase of the rate to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that it was expected to fall again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher rate than the 2 per cent planned was entirely the result of the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco’s Mortgage Brokers, said: “In view of the recent fall in Swap, it is likely that the mortgage market will become even more competitive again, as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good end of the year.
The market is particularly favorable for those who are nearing the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing of credit, often with the possibility of a commission, and with a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.
The Public Health Service will prescribe an HIV-controversial drug for 10,000 people
Beginning in September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” HIV prevention drug after the High Court's battle to fund the drug from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposive HIV prevention (PREP), a pre-sex pill that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in at-risk populations by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service for an initial three-year test period of about 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the test after the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court ' s decision last year, alleging that the National Health Service was in a position to pay for the PPE, despite her claims that it should be financed by the local authorities.
This move, which was announced on Thursday, was described as “the most important innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it a “turn point.
Prior to the full launch of the program all over England, by April 2018, VHDs in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, and more of them will join the program in October.
Pre-exposive prevention (PREP) is a pre-sex HIV course to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Research has shown that PEI significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking pre-sex POPs in humans, there are plenty of certain drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for medication include gay and bisexual men, transgender men and people whose partners are HIV positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispatchers will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenderers and persons of whom partners are unknown whether their HIV status is restricted by anti-retroviral therapy.
People who live and have been assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for a possible participation in the nearest venereal health centre in the program.
The program will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England has signed a drug-procurement contract this week after the international tender.
The study is designed to assess all the capabilities of the PEI by collecting clinical data on who the target audience of the drug is, on its absorptiveness, and on its use on a large scale.
“This critical innovation should complement and reinforce the wide-ranging and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the major health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, President of the NAT (National AIDS Control Authority), said, "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
The PEI, if properly targeted at people in need and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the state of the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at risk of HIV, thanks to a study carried out in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new, new means that can be controlled by a person without discussing it with a partner, which will result in the improvement of many or many lives.
We very much welcome this news.
Ian Greene, the president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The first thing to do is to make sure that the test is rolled out fast all over the country, and that no one at risk for HIV is forgotten.
Now that we've been provided with an experimental POP drug, we're going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.
The Shadow Minister of Public Health, Sharon Hodgson, said, "We very much welcome the start of the PEI test, which was very late due to months of delay and delay on the part of the government."
The data show how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and halting the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PEI.
Now it is important that the test be rolled up as soon as possible throughout the country to protect those at risk of HIV and to move us one step further towards halting the spread of HIV in society.
The World Congress of Tatar adopted a resolution on support for the Tatarstan-Russia treaty
The Sixth Congress of the World Tatar Congress (WCC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the office of President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a positive form of organization of the highest State authority in the Republic, expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people”.
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the delimitation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he “played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
Recall that the agreement between Moscow and Kazanho was concluded for 10 years on 24 July 2007.
On 11 July, the deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and to keep the name of the seat of head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only entity in the Federation that has a deal with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one who's called the "President."
In Russia, there are difficulties in obtaining international driving licenses.
GIEACPC units are in short supply of international driving permits (IDPs).
In order to obtain such rights, it takes weeks to wait, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go abroad on their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with regard to international driving permits remains controversial.
The IDP was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written on the national certificate, as it was explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are set out in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are also recognized.
In fact, however, it depends on a specific police or rental office: some require an IDP, while others have enough national rights.
In order to be safe, drivers of international law do receive, but it is worth bearing in mind that in non-ratifying countries (e.g., the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or IDPs.
There is now a problem with the form in almost all the units of HIELD, reporting to Commersant, after a study in a number of regions.
For example, in Moscow, the OGBD units have simply not been given a ticket, and the form has been short for four months.
You can make an appointment on the public service website, but it's already been waiting for mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is not possible to get the IDP "for technical reasons" without getting into the details, and in the Samara region it is fair to say that there are no forms, and the same is true in other cities.
The problem has already been met by many Moscows, and the social media is becoming more and more aware of this:
Irina Burmitrova: "Wait, why can't you get international rights in Moscow?"
That's right, 'cause all of the H.I.E.D. offices ran out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A question to people who know!"
We need to get international rights very urgently.
In Moscow, it's always far ahead, and the stamps don't give up at all (but it can't).
It's kind of like a public service portal to show that the Spb is free to go to hell.
Did anyone try to get in another city?
Will it work?
As the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation explained, the requirements for international driving permits have changed, so new forms are being delivered to the State Inspectorate.
This may be the result of a deficit, but it is not clear what changes are involved, nor has it been previously reported.
The forms are purchased by the Special Road Safety Center (SSC) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then delivered to the HIELD units.
In recent years, all the contracts have been awarded to the Goznák AO: in 2014 - 2015, almost 200,000 IDP forms were produced; in 2016, 15,000 forms were purchased; in 2017, 90,000, but the last contract was entered into with the First Printing Court SLA on 18 July for the production of 70,000 forms.
There's a theory that the NPR just didn't make it in time for the tender, which is why the deficit was created.
But there are other versions of the shortage of forms: because of the crisis, many people don't go to Europe on their own, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand, and so on.
What rights are accepted there is not entirely clear, so people are re-insurable, so there has been an arduous demand for international “crusts”.
It has recently become clear that professional drivers will have to take an examination to prove their qualifications.
Mintrans made such a proposal.
The international driving permit (IDP) of the new model has been in force since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Paul Petrenko, stated that he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, August 4th, he spoke about it in an interview with the Watcher Portal.
No self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or a stick in it, because it runs the risk of losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan, in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia on Crimea.
"That is, in my deep belief, there is in fact no prospect of this project," said Petrenko.
He added that he considered Russia unable to implement a major infrastructural project on its own.
Russia can't normally build even smaller objects.
I know that since the Sochi Olympics, the whole stadiums have begun to break down.
“So I think the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so short-sighted to join the project,” the official said.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of a car arch of the Krim Bridge.
On the Kerchen shore, a large-scale assembly of the Crimean Bridge road arch has been completed: it is closed at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
“Anytime, the bridge planners have prepared a rail arch on the fairway supports”, reported at the project information centre.
In April, the head of Mintrans, Maxim Sokolov, informed Russia’s President, Vladimir Putin, that the construction of the site was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will link the Crimean Peninsula to the Krasnodar Region.
In Spain, an official who had not been to work for 10 years was fired.
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to the public service) should the head of the Spanish official, Carles rescio, have?
The permanent hike lasted for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was still dismissed.
But not by your own boss.
Things in the bureaucrat world don't happen.
The otters seem to have been used to all the "people's service" scams for a long time.
And yet, officials are always able to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time the "sensation" came from Spain.
There, an archivist in Valencia, Carles Resio, managed to stay out of work for ten years.
At the same time, he was regularly paid.
And all the solids are 50,000 Euros a year.
And so Mr. Resio's "screw times" are over.
He was fired by the Valencia Legislative Assembly.
In the investigation, it transpired that a hard-core prowler came to the office every working morning at 07:00 to report to the electronics system.
And then he went home.
Once again, he showed up at 4 p.m. to report back to the system that he had left.
And it's been 10 years.
It was also reported that all the free time the loser spent drawing comics at home.
The members of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia are now thinking about how to punish Mr. Recio, the first-hand head, who could not help but know how to “actually work” in his place of work.
Judges are offered protection from the Presidents
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (CHR) on behalf of Vladimir Putin has put forward proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes to limit the powers of the Presidents of the Courts and to introduce their electiveness.
For the Courts of Appeal and Cassation, the HRC wishes to introduce special districts that will not be linked to the administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals in the context of the presidential mandate.
The HRC has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by HRC on behalf of Wladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, which was given by the President after a meeting with the Council.
The meeting with the Council on 8 December 2016 included individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention (see OS, 9 December).
The work of the HRC has resulted in 25 proposals, which address both the issues of ensuring the independence of the judiciary and the identification of miscarriage of justice, as well as the financing of the courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Cremlin human rights defenders was to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts in order to increase the independence of the rest of the judiciary.
If the candidate for the position of judge has been successful and has received the support of the judicial community, the President of the Court, according to the HRW, must submit him for appointment without the right to refuse, as the law now permits.
It is also proposed to disqualify the President from assigning cases to the judges.
Doing this, the experts say, can be a specially written computer program.
The HRC also considers that the President is not entitled to “predetermine the results of a judge's qualification, initiate disciplinary action, and make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments”.
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to “elect the presidents of the courts themselves” and to “entitle them to a relatively short period of office with a mandatory rotation”.
The President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation now appoints all the Presidents of the Courts (representing the Republican to the Regional Courts) for a period of six years.
In order to protect the judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HRC proposes to re-organize the appeal and cassation before the courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC states that “it is necessary to ensure that individual courts of appeal and cassation are organized not at the level of the regional courts in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts”.
The experts base their practice on the practice of arbitral tribunals.
There are “judiciary districts” which do not match administrative division in the Russian Federation, but which thus guarantee greater independence from regional officials, who find it difficult to use “telephone law”.
The HRC ' s peace judges propose to be strengthened by the people ' s jurors in order to deal with some of the “civil and administrative categories” with them.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, reinstatement at work, the protection of honour and dignity, the denial of driver's license, etc.
"These are just our proposals," explained the "OJ" member of the HRC, a retired judge of the Constitutional Court of Tamara Morsjakov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate concerned not only the HRC, but also the Supreme Court, which had not yet made its proposals public.
There is still time to carry out the task of the Supreme Court (with the Office of the Attorney-General and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation).
To inform Vladimir Poetin of the effectiveness of the Russian Federation ' s independence of justice, the President of the Armed Forces, Vyacheslav Lebedev, is due to do so by 1 September.
Living a high life: half-storys and clever designs have turned this little place in Earls Court into a spacious place.
Joan Lee, a former banker interested in real-estate repairs, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the ground floor of a pretty model home like Queen Anne, and in favor of a new design, it says that Joan didn't pack her stuff and move again.
"I used to live with my ex-boyfriend in Knightsbridge in a much larger area," Joan tells me.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were also high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered her a price on the same day."
Since the first view, an apartment of 1,000 square feet has been refurbished.
Originally, it was an apartment with one bedroom of complex design – to get to the bedroom, to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add space to store things and half-decks to get the best out of the rich height of the ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
That was my demand," she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill's "Duck & Shed", an architectural design studio, to use the ceilings 12.5 feet high and to build a home that would not only be a successful project, but would be right for Joan to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to set up two spaces over one another, so the architectural task was to create a semi-deck where you could stand up in full size.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the breeze.
“Working with steel designs is very complex,” he explains.
“We needed to place the space so that it would be one over the other, and we didn't have to bend.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to bend the design so that it would be at the right height and make it possible to use the spaces from the top and bottom.
This decision enabled Erfan to set up two full-sized rooms one over the other in the space, and a lot more interesting.
From the semi-deck through the vintage copper light window, "Retrouvius" opens a view of the luxurious living room below.
Mirror furniture with golden trim, silver accents, and vintage light from Serge Muy set the design style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding sight, space, and light.
The short hallway is framed with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a mirror ward looks like a window to the other room.
At the inlet, the mirror cupboards are used to store all of Joan’s dishes.
To create a sense of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can block the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new to the cuisines.
The unique thing about this kitchen is, it's a moving door up, like in the garage.
“The engineering was involved here,” Erfan tells us about the wooden fibrous shield door.
“It is equipped with a counterweight, so when you push a door up, it slips very easily.”
Thanks to the wise use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom, and an improved plan.
“In the end, the area of the floors is exactly what you're going to sell, that is, what your property is worth,” Erfan says.
“Surely, a real-estate agent will go in and make calculations based on the gender area.”
Here, they have been able to expand the area of the floors by using quality materials that give space a shade of luxuriousness.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help to make an emotional connection to the home,” Erfan says.
“No one falls in love with electrical wiring in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't touch the strings of our hearts."
This is an indication that, with good design and an extra metre, an apartment can turn out to be something that's amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government has approved the establishment of a commission on cultural policy
The Government of Russia has approved the establishment of a commission on State cultural policy.
The relevant order is published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policies.
The commission will also draft a strategy for cultural policy, clarify the tasks and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation has been appointed head of the commission.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, approved a plan for the implementation of the State cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and includes measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, to preserve the common cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also help to create conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries fell to a minimum of eight years
The growth in consumer prices in the G20 countries has fallen to the lowest in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, with reference to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
OECD estimates that inflation in June 2016 was 2 per cent, with lower inflation in October 2009, when the price index was 1.7 per cent.
Rossstat previously reported a drop of 0.1 per cent in the Russian consumer price index.
The agency thus recorded the first week of deflation in 2017.
Inflation in Russia is estimated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economics, however, believes that the target has already been met - according to this agency, the figure is 4 per cent.
Poetin warned against the illegal cutting off of the Baykal taiga
The Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, warned at a meeting on the environmental development of natural bikal territory against the illegal destruction of forests.
In the course of the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergey Donski, noted that a bill had been drafted earlier.
It permits logging during fires, and the Government is planning to take it in the fall.
The President, in turn, said that the project needed to be kept under review to ensure that “the whole thing was not shut down in a row”.
Donski noted that the bill involved the control of the MES and the supervisory authorities.
Media: WSU fighters secretly negotiate with Donbassa militia
There is a regular telephone service in the area of the armed confrontation in Donbassa.
Fighters of the warring parties keep talking to each other on their mobile phones, and they don't know about it at headquarters.
The FSU and the Donbassa militia have set up their cell phones in secret from their high command.
On 4 August, Strana.ua reported this with reference to the military operation in Donbassa.
According to the publication, unit commanders know the names of their counterparts on the other side of the front and communicate with them daily on their phones.
Communicating is not a private matter: the commanders are trying to reach some “tactical arrangements”.
Frequently, the result of such conversations is a truce on a certain part of the front.
Journalists have been informed of cases in which an officer has been given his official enemy to congratulate him on his birthday due to the line of the front.
The FSU and the NPD and LPD have been in the trenches on the line of delimitation since spring 2014, when Ukraine began a combat operation against Donbass.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has resented the blocking of U.N.S. Army statements about attacks on the Embassy of the Russian Federation.
In the Russian Foreign Policy Department, the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives, who block the statements of the United Nations in the press condemning the terrorist bombardment of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Syria, are outraged.
This is reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Department was reminded that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus, on 2 August, was the third time in a month to be bombarded by Hiat Tahrir Al-Sham (former Jabhat al-Nusra, banned in the Russian Federation) and Falak Al-Rahman.
Taking into account the fact that the international community is united in the characterization of Nusra as a terrorist organization, and the UNSC resolutions are calling for a response to this structure, the FFM stated that “it would be clear that the Nusra attacks should be universally condemned, and there should be no ambiguities in the assessment of the attacks against diplomatic missions”.
However, as the Department of Public Information has stressed, “for the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine on the United Nations Security Council, alternating the tone of the objections, concealing the argument of the alleged lack of the necessary information, blocked the Russian Federation's proposal to adopt a standard short draft Security Council press statement condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital”.
The unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us should be left to those delegations.
“More than anything else, the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists prompts them to resort to new provocations and attacks, gives them a sense of impunity,” the MFA stated, and added, “wouldn't want these barbarians to have a belief that there is someone on the Security Council with them”.
Wladimir Putin was in favour of limiting the number of unplanned business checks
Russian President Wladimir Putin, at a meeting on investment projects in the Far East, stated that the number of unplanned business inspections should be reduced to 30 per cent of the number of scheduled business visits, as well as the need to limit the duration of inspections to ten days.
“Unplanned checks are generally carried out without the appropriate agreement with the Public Prosecutor's Office; only 2-3 per cent is in agreement with the Public Prosecutor's Office, and the rest goes on its own”, quotes the President of TASS.
Wladimir Putin also said that it was necessary to prohibit investigators from seizing servers and hard disks in business.
In addition, in the view of the President, business associations should have the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
“This, I hope, will make some positive progress in dealing with business-related cases or infringing the law on business”, the Head of State said.
According to OOO, the number of other types of business inspections is on the rise as a result of the moratorium on scheduled inspections.
In May, at the request of the Russian President, Boris Titov, a business mobman, a survey was conducted, which revealed that there was in fact a replacement of routine checks by extra-planned means (the share of which ran from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), a prosecutorial rate (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), a raid (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), and an application check (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and an administrative investigation (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).

Brothers are fighting for a real-estate empire worth over $500 million.
Two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's largest real-estate empires worth over $500 million – 40 years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
The former director of Carlton Football Club and the developer Colin de Lutis live at the Torak Palace at three doors from his younger brother Paul, who sued the Supreme Court for a division of property and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still in a bitter dispute about the terms of the divorce.
The brothers, together with their mother, Anne, own 87 sites worth over half a billion dollars, which have been bought since their family bought a shop on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew up in a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family's property list today includes office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Golden Bank and Mount Bueller, and shopping centres in the suburbs.
By agreement with the late father, Colin - who Paul describes as the "primary driving force and dominant person" of the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's property is 176 million.
The division of property and money has become a stumbling block for Paul.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my view, the best parts of property," he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after a number of failed attempts at reconciliation, the first Supreme Court hearing took place.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - from which Paul thought Colin had expelled him.
Colin claims it's not, but he's blaming Paul for incompetent management of some of the facilities.
In Colin's statement at the start of the trial, he said he was looking forward to a settlement.
"My Italian roots make me think of the family as the top priority," he wrote.
The court's costs are rising like a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer; both parties have brought in the best-known lawyers, including royal attorney Allan Myers, and the best cooks.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late wife, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they have run dairy bars and malls, and in the early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a shop in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans shop.
Colin says he ran Westco when he was "in the last grade of the school, and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, were hoping to hand over their property to their sons without conflict.
"Louisi used to tell me he didn't want the brothers to go to court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lucis group; Colin says Mark got 10 million when he left the business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the financial terms of their office."
Colin was not a public figure, even though he was a former member of the AFL Club's board of directors and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of a TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied with a text message that, since the case had not yet been heard in court, "I really have nothing to say."
"I'm very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and lament the name of our family in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin testified that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want to see Paul and me arguing in court," he said, adding, "still hope for a solution to the conflict."
This hope must have dissipated on Friday.
"The decision in our case will be made soon by the court," writes Colin.
The new Chief of Staff of Trump is planning to limit information to the President.
Others have tried to do so and have been defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
Then he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news outlets from the media, hoping to keep the Chief in a more secure state.
That's what reporter Josh Dozee says.
"At a meeting held by the new Chief of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, with the Chief of Staff on his first day of business, he identified the main problem in the White House of President Donald Trump, which he hopes to address: bad channels of information to the President."
Kelly told the staff that the information should go through it, in hard copy or through briefings, because it would be better for the president to make decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is very true, but others have already failed in trying to keep Trump at bay by tracking the information.
President Trump's relationship with TV took place a few decades ago - and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, resented the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he was given fair coverage in the publications that could be reconvinced," said "Politico" in February by Sam Nanzberg, a former electoral staff adviser.
Tara Palmeri then wrote to "Politico" that "in the words of the six former members of the electoral headquarters, to control Trump's Twitter usage, it was necessary to make sure that the information that he received was a constant stream of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's habit of tweeting was ever "under control" is funny.
Maybe these members of the electoral headquarters know something we don't know - for example, that if it weren't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about Tweets Trump didn't publish.
If his staff had saved him from trouble at least a few times, their efforts had not been in vain.
But no one has always been able to keep Trump from putting oil in the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving Trump material - secure or not - that supports their views.
"Politico" - just about this story - wrote in May about the tendency of the councillors to keep the president in question.
Here's an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Trump's current and former staff say that Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially with dangerous leaks of information, and will not rest until he finds out who was behind them.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone gave the president a printout of an article from GotNews.com, a Web page by Charles C. Johnson, in which the deputy head of the office, Katy Welsh, was accused of "staying behind the runaways" in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is forever tampered with on Twitter for his aggressive behavior, that he didn't present any specific facts, or that in the past he's been setting up false accusations, and then he's renouncing them.
Trump read the article and began to ask the staff about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that the then Chief of Staff Raines Prius and the Chief of Staff, Rob Porter, "tryed to build a system to control and document Trump's flow of paper."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same.
He may be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature, and his associates are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
The Tumen Public Prosecutor ' s Office is fighting an HIV dissenting woman
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the ruling of the Kalininsky Rye Court of Tumeni, who had dismissed the criminal case against a local woman who had died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child was killed because the mother was an HIV dissenting woman and refused to be treated.
The court, however, absolved her of responsibility for reconciliation with her father.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished without setting a precedent for other HIV dissenters.
The case against a Tumenian woman was initiated in April, following the death of her three-year-old daughter, under article 109 of the Criminal Code (death due to carelessness).
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
"The woman was not treated herself and refused to treat her daughter in the belief that there was no HIV infection," explained the Tumen State Attorney's Office.
The criminal case was brought to the Kalininsky Rye of Tumeni, which decided on 25 July to put an end to it.
The dead girl's father made an application for this, explaining that “he has pardoned his wife, has no claim against her, has made up for the harm, and has apologised”.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office disagreed with the court ' s decision and filed an appeal, demanding the annulment of the dismissal order and referring it to a new hearing.
The girl is dead, and it is not possible to make up for the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the advice of the doctors, refused to examine the baby and to treat her against a dangerous infection,” reported the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In the view of the supervisory body, it should be punished, otherwise it would be followed up by other HIV dissenters.
According to the Tumen AIDS Center, there are now about 12 children living with HIV in Tumen oblast who do not receive health care due to parental failure.
"And this situation has already improved -- in the year of the work of the special group, half the parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV have changed their mind -- they have made it possible to have a diagnosis, they have started to take medications," said the Spokesman of the AIDS Center, Elena Loseva.
According to her, it was not possible to have a legal effect on the parents, and as a result not all HIV-infected children were found, the mothers were not allowed to examine them, to hide themselves, to run away with the children from the hospitals.
The risk of HIV dissenters
At the end of last year, the peterburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called HIV-dissent movement.
HIV dissenters call people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take drugs.
Medics and activists in AIDS service NCBs call such views anti-medicine, and they are seen to be a serious threat to the spread of such views.
A terrible photo session, which ended in a tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the Greek rail station in Khmelnitsk.
The cheerful company of drunken young men was walking over the railroads, where the freight train was standing.
One friend had an idea to make an imaginary selfie on the top of the car, and he told FACTAM in the Hmelnica County Police Communications Branch.
The guy started getting off the bridge to the train, but due to his indiscretion, he clinged to the power line and got a shock.
Luckily, this incident was reported to the station's controller, who immediately called an "emergency."
Prior to the arrival of the victim, the doctor was transferred to a safe place and then hospitalized in the burning section of the Khmelnitsk Regional Hospital.
The men were diagnosed with 1 to 2 levels of body burns.
His condition is now assessed as stable.
Lawkeepers recall that, in recent times, extreme selfies on the rooftops of multi-decks, bridges, and mobile transport have become more popular.
The police call on people to be watchful and to prevent such photographs, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the oceans to exist on the ancient Venus
In the ancient Venus, there may have been oceans.
That was an assumption made by French scientists.
The experts have created a computer model that has demonstrated the formation of water on the surface of the planet, and it is written by Science News.
It turns out that in Venus, at the beginning of its history, there were oceans with 10% more water than it is now on Earth.
Previously, "Argument of the week" had written that, according to the scientific hypothesis, the ocean could have existed on Mars four billion years ago.
In the course of their research, the foreign experts concluded that the water object was located on the Northern Hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were shot in a park in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were shot dead, handing out the Associated Press.
The incident took place in Dolores Park, with a significant number of visitors.

One of them took out a gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the intruders could not be seen, as they had all but their eyes closed.
Another was provided with medical care, after which he was released.
The third wounded is a minor, no details of his condition.
The Dolores Park Hill is a popular place for locals and tourists.

Luna's rock band will present a new album in Barnaul.
The Luna rock band concert will be held in Barnaul on 17 October.
The band will present their new album, "The Wonderful New World", which was one of the most expected releases of the year.
The group is preparing a concept show, which will be the brightest in the band's live history.
"The Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Luna.
His name is related to the famous O. Hucksley Antiope Romany "O Wonderful New World."
The new songs don't relay the book, they talk about a society that lives by the law of anti-Utopia, " blindly believing in propaganda and imposed values."
The band was helped to raise the money for the album: on the Planet.ru website, the project was supported by more than 1,200 people.
Her first album, "Make Louder!", was released in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians introduced the record "Time X", and in 2013 they recorded the album, "We are Luna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, Luna played a symphony band at "Crocus City Hall" with the "Songs of Peace" program.
The group was composed of Lusine Gevorkian (vocal), Vitaly Demidenko (bas-gitara), Ruben Kasarian (gitara), Sergey Poncratew (gitara), Leonid Kinsburski (Arabs).
The concert will take place at the Barnaul Club, Faraon, on October 17, at 7:00.
The price of the tickets is between 1200 and 2600 roubles.

The collection was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The band won a number of wins in the different titles of the Blue Dome.
The gypsies overcame the trench and returned to the "millionaire street"
Some of the richest landlords in West Midland are again in conflict with the strong Gypsies, who have overcame the moor that has been dug by the municipal authorities in order to re-enter the field next to their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 homes on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihalla street, which was a funny name for the millionaire street.
With horses, infants, and a lot of wheelhouses, they returned after being kicked out no more than in May, and they were not prevented by the moor dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactful company found a rift in the defensive and shredded its vehicles through a section that left unsolved to leave space for the path.
Angrily residents attacked the city of Solihal, saying it was “unable to solve the problem.”
Anonymous local lady said, "They arrived here on Monday night after being driven out of Bentley Heath, where they threw rocks at passers-by."
The city should be shamed and forced to act, because it is not able to solve the problem.
The gypsies were here in May, and they were banished, and now they're back again.
Last night, more gypsies arrived, and today perhaps even more.
"The Birmingham city knows how to deal with this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like the fact that I'm still paying the municipal tax, and the municipality can't even put an end to it.
A local man who wanted to stay anonymous said, "This is funny, we just saw these gypsies leave the previous time, and here we go, this attack is going on."
This time, there are more, and we even saw a horse graze on the meadow.
A representative of the city of Solihalla stated: “We know about an illegal camp on land near Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solival Police; we are taking the necessary legal action to get them out of here as soon as possible.”
To help us gather evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police on the phone 101.
This gives us a picture of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea's a new-world champagne plant.
The PCO of the Republic of Crimea, the “New World Champagne Plant”, has decided to take action by transforming the “New World Champagne Plant” into the OAO, following an order from the Minister of Property and Land Relations, Krim Anna Anukhina.
100 per cent of the company's shares will remain in the state of Crimea.
The fixed capital of the stock company will be 595.5 million roubles, and will consist of 5.955 million common shares at a nominal cost of 100 roubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Crimea, has stated that if funds are not available for the upgrading of the plant in the next three years, the plant will be at risk of shutting down.
In the company, the cost of basic funds is between 60 and 70 per cent.
Modernization of a business requires 1.2 billion roubles. By virtue of the institutional and legal form, it is required to pay 50 per cent of the income to the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"It's not easy to get money from the owner, to talk about borrowing money from big credit organizations," said the head of the crim minehouse, Sergey Petelin, in April this year.
The Crimea Parliament has included the business in the privatisation plan for 2017.
It was suggested that he should be arraigned and put on a bid.
The source of Interfax in the Crimea authorities has estimated the possible value of the business's sale of $40 million, and the investor's investment in the modernization of the company has been estimated at $30 million.
The New World in 2016 increased the production of game wine by 2.8 per cent over the 2015 level, to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New World intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lion Golitsyn as a production plant for the production of playful wine in the New World property he acquired.
The plant is located on 11 hectare of land.
Suburban third graders shattered over 40 gravestones
Members of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Nizhgorod oblast have identified the citizens who have demolished 46 gravestones in the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
Intruders turned out to be third-class students.
The first claim that the tombstones were damaged by unknowns was made to the Russian Department of Internal Affairs on 27 June in the Liskowski Region.
In all, 24 people approached the police.
As a result, criminal proceedings have been instituted under article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, “Destroying, damaging or desecrating the graves”.
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, two of whom were children at the age of 8 and 9.
Young offenders told the police that they wanted to see the monuments fall, and that prompted them to commit hooliganism.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening the tone with regard to the ships of non-governmental organizations saving migrants.
Italy has warned the NGOs that own rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue if they do not comply with the new rules governing their operations.
“Unless NGOs follow the new code of conduct, it is hard to say if they can continue to do so,” said the Minister of the Interior, Mario Minniti, in an interview with the Turin daily Stampa.
A warning was given to Minnichi the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Retette on the basis of suspicion that its crew was in fact cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has been working for only a year, has declined to comment on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Kartozio.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we are very sorry we can't continue to work in the search and rescue zone," states the organization's statement on social media.
"We will be able to assess all the charges that have been brought now, only after we have gathered all the information and have an assessment of the situation."
The Italian authorities have been following the Juventa ship, which belongs to the Jugend Retette, since October.
His crew is suspected of having taken migrants on board by lifeboats, who were sent directly to them, and allowing smugglers to leave with boats they could use again.
At least one such meeting is expected to take place within 1.3 miles of the Libyan coastline, as is stated in the prosecution file, the content of which was published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the orders of the Italian shore authorities, which control rescue operations in the zone, on the basis of humanitarian zeal rather than on any other ground.
The Code of Conduct presupposes, for the most part, that a “Juventa”-type court will have on board an Italian police officer to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue have agreed to submit to the Code: Save the Children, Maltese MOAS, and Pro-Activa Open arms from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new rules to be unnecessary, but acceptable, on the condition that they would not cause any “significant change or hindrance” to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is MSF.
In the meantime, Minnichi said that the dramatic decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations in recent weeks indicated that efforts to support the Libyan Coast Guard and co-operation with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In the last days we began to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the Minister said.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict."
The authorities of the Russian Federation have recently significantly stepped up their policy on the Libyan track, and with their visits to Moscow, the delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have become more active.
The head of the Russian contact group for an intra-Libian settlement at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, the assistant head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Degov, told us what the objectives of Moscow in the region are and on whom he is betting.
The contact group on Libya, which you are chairing, is almost unknown.
Let's say the contact group on Ukraine -- everyone knows about it.
And here is a cloak of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The contact group was established at the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
It is run by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mikhail Bogdanov, and Adam Delimhanov.
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan track by the Speaker of the State of Vyacheslav Woldin.
The reason for the formation of the group was the detention in Libya of a Russian tanker, the Chebotarev Mechanic (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board).
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military experts, representatives of the State, was set up, and our work was supported by the head of Checheny Ramzan Kadirov.
How come you're the one who led it?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group.
Our work has not been limited to the release of seamen from the Chebotarev Mechanical.
We have been able to reach out to the representatives of all major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict, as well as to Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government is based under Faiz Saraj. - "Oz") and to Tobrook (the parliamentary section that opposes the Government and supports marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern part of Libya. - "Oz").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (the Libyan Vice-Prime Minister) we have been able to quickly agree on the release of Russian seamen.
It was then decided to make better use of those contacts, to set up a contact group.
Its task is to analyse the situation, to identify key factors and players, and to engage with all parties to the conflict.
I want to stress, in particular, that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict; we are engaged in a dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group, and how many of them are in Libya on a permanent basis?
The contact group now has five members.
Among them are people with experience in the security forces, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to include in the group of regional experts from the Institute of the Middle East Rana.
There is no permanent presence of any of our staff in Libya, which is not yet necessary.
Is there any Russian military advisors, instructors in Libya now?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All the talk and publications about this are not true.
But in your contact group, the ex-military include...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
Like when we go to hot spots.
Or cities that have been closed to a certain point for us, such as Misurata (where the militias that have played a role in the overthrow of the Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, in 2011 and have been significantly intensified in the years to come.
We arrived in Misurat in January this year.
We're scared, they're saying it's all Islamist, terrorists.
But it was important for us to take stock of the situation, to take stock of the real military potential, who was responsible, why such rumours, what the real role of Islamists was, was going on.
In Misurat, we met with all the members of the units that were involved in the destruction of IG in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was taken away from the Russian-prohibited “Islamic State” - UO).
We wanted to see them, meet these people, check out the information that they played a critical role in the destruction of the IG in Libya, not the Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these to himself.
And what do you think?
Is it not Haftar who won the Islamic State in Libya?
He didn't do it.
Haftar was operating on another front, in Benghazi.
And with the IG in Sirte, there was a struggle between the structures under the Government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we have invited to Russia the people who have been conducting this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived -- the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, in Douma, MIDE, and Rosgwardia.
You, as we understand it, are in all the Libyan regions, and you probably imagine the sentiments of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the cease-fire agreements, the elections reached at the end of July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as has been the case many times in the past, the agreements will be shattered, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to take power alone?
The fact that Saraj and Haftar have agreed to another meeting has been a good signal to us, not long ago.
In the recent past, both leaders have been very negative about each other.
And as for Russia's position...
It is often said and written that Moscow has been active in support of Haftara, and many believe it.
We were in this situation when we were in Misurat, and Haftar was on the same day on board a Russian air carrier, Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurat, they didn't believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people who came to us today."
But our task is to show that we do not support just Haftar, we are engaged in a dialogue with all the key players in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar have been in touch.
Does it make it easier to have an understanding with Russian partners on a human, emotional level that he has been studying twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
Russian, if he knows, it's very relative.
But the fact that he learned from us, of course, makes it easier to talk to him.
And by the way, it's not just him.
When we talk to the military in Tripoli and Misurat, we meet the generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And now they're very good at speaking Russian.
And it goes to Russia, it's kind of nostalgic about it.
Do you think it is possible to lift the arms embargo imposed on Libya as soon as possible?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian arms?
Of course, but, as I said, we don't take sides in this conflict, and we don't want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be in an almost equal position.
As far as the arms embargo is concerned, there are constant calls from the Libyans for Russia to help with the lifting of the arms embargo.
The process of constitution-making is now under way in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromises, reach an internal consensus.
The election is to take place, as was the case at a meeting between Saraj and Haftara.
If the elections are held and the legitimate power is finally elected (and none of the parties now has such a status), the question of lifting the arms embargo can be raised in the UN Council.
To raise this issue now is pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
In the media the other day, it was reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees moving from Libya, felt left behind by EU allies.
Can Moscow, in this situation, help Italian partners by using its links with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is it that the Haftar forces will take control of the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers moving immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We're working hard on it.
The Italians need the support of Russia, because Moscow has a dialogue at the same time with Haftar, Saraj, Misurat, and the south.
The tribes in southern Libya play a major role in this matter, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it a question of the South to stop the flow of migrants on long-distance fronts?
So, by the way, they've been unrolling back the bus with the Nigerian migrants on their way?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups have an interest in keeping these streams going.
We hope to help bring the South together in the negotiation process between Sarajé, Haftar and the tribes of the South.
But first, we would like to see a unified view on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered to be an Islamist, a supporter of Shariah in the country.
How radical is he?
Would this not be an obstacle to building up relations with Russia or the West?
I'll tell you my personal opinion of him.
In my view, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists are part of his coalition.
Yes, but it is his own position that Libya must be a completely normal country - a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he is also active in the fight against terrorists.
How does he have such a reputation?
It is created by those countries that do not want Russia to be in contact with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, and there is a legislative, executive, and judicial power.
There's a national oil corporation, a national bank, and other State entities.
Of course, some countries wanted us to stay out of it.
And we mixed up all the charts and began to be active with both Tripoli and Tobrook.
We are already reaping the benefits of this work: Rosneft has entered into a cooperation agreement with the Libyan State Oil Company, NOC.
The director of NOC, Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, made a deal, himself from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, there was the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft.
What will Russia do with it?
I'm guessing to resell.
What other economic interests do Russia have in Libya?
Plans to re-sign the contracts under Muammar Gaddafi.
These include previous transport agreements (railway construction), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay for?
Well, they have oil.
So this is, as in the case of Iran, the oil-for-service scheme?
I don't know what the pattern will be, I don't deal with these very things.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We're actually doing peacekeeping work there.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans to negotiate with one another so that they can establish order, and Libya has ceased to be a propitious environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, the main task is to help the Libyan people and to get the terrorists out of there.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that, to date, no one from Russia or from other countries of the former USSR has been there.
He said he's got about 50,000 phone records from Islamist and radical groups (in Libya - OS) and there's no Russian talk.
And from what States, then, are these militants?
I don't want to go into this detail.
Then we'll put the question differently.
How many of the Muslim militants in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are virtually no Libyans among them, not more than 5 per cent.
The rest are incoming.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libish talks like Paris?
There are plans.
We are engaged in intensive negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have indicated their readiness to go to Moscow or Grozny again.
And when can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say right now.
A number of visits are still due, and I hope that the time and place of the talks will be clear.
At the Czech Museum, the charities raised money for a dear gift to a sick boy.
A nine-year-old boy, Sacha Machola, who has a DCP, a brain hydrocephalus and a complete blindness, will receive a special runway on August 5th.
Sashe is the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region, Oksana Kosareva, and the Director of the Museum, Constantine Bobkov.
The money for the train was collected during the Charity Marathon "Don't Get Tired of Doing Good", which was held in Melihov on July 15, on Chekhov's Day of Remembrance.
On the eve of the marathon at the museum, a letter from Sacha, who lives in the village of Manushino of the Czech Region, was sent, "I don't see any eye, so I asked my mom to write this letter."
"I'd love to get a runaway to make my legs strong, and I'd learn to walk a bit."
And now Sashina's dream has come true!
After the performance in the Museum of the Preserve, there will be a "Concert Postscriptum", a well-known pianist, a well-deserved Russian artist, Alexander Gindin, who will perform a purry of popular classical works.
During the Melihov Charitable Marathon, the Choir of the Easter Dawid Desert, the callers of the Ilya Drozdichin workshop, the students of the Moscow Conservatorium, P. I. Chaikovsky and the Russian Academy of Gnesin, and the artists of the Melihovo Theatre of the Chekhovsky Studio.
An auction was held for visitors, a book fair and a donation of souvenirs with a marathon logo.
The Melikhovo Museum took the initiative to make Chekov Day a single day of charity in all the Museums of Moscow on 15 July.
A 30-year-old in Olevska, Gitomir oblast, near the local football stadium, shot several times at the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was aroused by the noise, and was told by FACTAM in the Communicate Department of the Gitomir Region Police.
Afterward, the man entered a cafe in the area.
There was a conflict in the building, in which a man used rubber bullets to fire a shot-off device, wounding one of the visitors.
A 34-year-old victim was given the necessary medical care, and there was no threat to his life.
The police and the ambulance arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled by then.
The law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man couldn't explain his actions.
He's got a device to fire off the rubber bullets that was sent to the lab.
For this reason, criminal proceedings have been instituted in accordance with article 296 of the Criminal Code.
The detainee is liable to 3 to 7 years ' imprisonment.
In Kyiv, on Lukyanovka, on the street of Tatar on the night of 28 July, there was a shooting attack.
Michelle Carter's conviction for messages that led to Conrad Roy's suicide
A resident of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment for using text messages and phone calls to induce her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to kill.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five more years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roe's father said at the Thursday hearing, "My family has been saddened.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appeal.
She was facing a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy had mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing up, shrugging her hands and lowering her eyes.
"In her actions, she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She cut off his life to improve hers.
She didn't accept responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a tragic incident that she deeply regrets."
But Judge Lawrence Monice said that in his view, her "age, maturity, or even mental illness didn't have an appreciable effect on her actions."
The Prosecutor read out the statements of Roy Lynn Roy's mother, which said, "it's not a day since I didn't mourn the loss of my dear son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I'm doing it - I'm trying to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will stay with us forever," he says.
Roy's sister, Kamdin Roy, said that she was incessantly persecuted by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become an aunt of his children.
"Like a man who's always been with me since I was born, it's a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case is likely to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that would make it a liability to counsel a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in the car with symptoms of CO2 poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The incident drew the country's attention when it was reported that he was forced to kill Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don't know how many ways," she wrote in a number of messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before suicidal, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monice said Carter wanted to get attention by means of Roy's death, and he barred her from talking to the press to keep her from getting what she wanted.
The legal opinion on this matter was divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for the murder of her British roommate in Italy and was acquitted two years later.
The 30-year-old Knox published in The Los Angeles Times her dissenting opinion, saying, "Michel Carter deserves sympathies and help, not prison."

Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played UNIX for three seasons, and in each match he played a high-level, 100%-performing game.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and his game career.

Today, Adieh rescuers by helicopter evacuated from the mountainous area of the Republic a Moscow tourist who had been hit with extreme solar burns.
The man was resting at the Fish Home, at an altitude of 1,600 meters.
A 27-year-old tourist was under a lot of pressure as well as pain in breathing.
Pre-diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescue team was approached by the head of the tour team, who told us that the man had been burned on a camping trip.
Up to 850,000 diesels are to be modified by Audi
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW announced that it would be an offer to update the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The president of BMW stated that the company was of the view that “there are more intelligent ways than restrictions on driving”, with reference to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is located – that were considering the possibility of prohibiting or limiting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler stated on Thursday that he was modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel outflow.
None of the companies called their step a renunciation.
European automotive manufacturers have been active in promoting the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to help implement CO2 regulations.
But nitrous oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automotive manufacturers of equipment that neutralizes the exhaust of diesel cars is also rising, and it is becoming difficult to maintain a competitive car price.
While German automakers are under close scrutiny, the Government of chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of subjugating powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies try not to repeat the Folxwagen error, which concealed the use of so-called “default devices”, which, during the test, were able to correct the amount of harmful gases that were released to conform to the rules, and in normal driving conditions were deactivated.
In the United States, several leaders of Volkswagen have been convicted, and the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in Germany, a former head of the Thermodynamics was arrested as part of the Audi engine development team.
Ex-manager, Zackeo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, and therefore not protected from extradition, and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was subject to a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to bypass European emission regulations and expanded the investigation, which was previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation can cause serious problems for Volkswagen: the producer of elitary cars is the source of a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s income.
In Astrohani, a visitor to a cafe paid off with false money.
The police received a report from a member of the bank office about the discovery of a suspicious sum of 5,000 roubles in the recalculation of funds from the general supply point.
A study at the Forensic Center found it to be false.
According to the U.S. Department of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Astrakhan Region, one of the visitors to the coffee shop, who bought the shawrum, paid a bill.
It is worth noting that the cashier was not equipped with a device to determine the authenticity of the bill.
At present, the police have identified persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a well-known forged Russian Federation CB ticket.
Such offences are punishable by up to eight years ' imprisonment with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs calls on the people of the Astrakhan Region to pay attention to financial transactions; it is recommended that traders install instruments to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers have found a hellish planet where even iron can melt.
For the first time, after studying the properties of the stratospheric giant exoplanet, called WASP-121b, astrophysics were quite amazed by its temperature, which can evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts have noticed that water molecules are so warmed up by the light of a star that they release infrared radiation.
The Hubble Telescope has captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant, which is the high temperature that makes the water in the planet's atmosphere glow infrared.
WASP-121b is a so-called hot Jupiter, a gas giant, in size and mass, comparable to the largest planet in the solar system, but tens of times closer to the parent star.
This is why the exoplanet has only 1.3 "earth" days, and its gas casing has been heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change is threatening a lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but there are now fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has become worse because of the dry weather and the insect-borne diseases; this has led to the constant headaches of scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the Provence Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM, says, "Lavanda in Provence is indeed at risk, because in recent years the plant has been experiencing the effects of climate change: in the spring, and especially in the fall, the rains have been much lower.
This has an impact on the lifespan of a lavender.
And there's a little cicade that jumps over the leaves of insects that transfer microbacteria; in the very dry weather, there's a lot of them."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavendel not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very much needed in perfume and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says, "Besides very long grains with a lot of big colors, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened, or no.
So we've got less parts of air oil."
The solutions currently under consideration include better water distribution and slower evaporation from the soil, as well as plant spraying with a mix of clay and water, and more drought-resilient varieties.
Ambassador of the Winter University of 2019 met with the red-haired students
The two-time world hockey champ, Ambassador of the Winter University of 2019, Alexander Semin met with the start-up hockey player the previous day and gave autographs to the fans.
The meeting was held at the 2019 Winter University in the context of the theme week of hockey with the puck.
Any visitor to the tent was able to skate on a field with artificial ice.
In addition, relays, quizzes and play-offs of student game souvenirs, and aerobics reunions were organized.
The event was attended by 50 students.
Alexander Semin advised the kids to do as much sports as possible, and stressed that the most important thing at the start of their studies was to work hard and to have a big will to do hockey.
"Great, there's a place in Krasnoyarsk like the Winter Universidad 2019, where beginners can ask questions directly to the team's coaches," said the champ.
Let us note that ambassadors of the Winter University of 2019 help to promote student sports and a healthy way of life among redheads.
The university's tent will work for the entire summer season until September 25, reporting to the Department of the Winter University of 2019.
The State Department commented on the words of Medvedev.
The U.S. State official Heather Nauert, commenting at the briefing on the remarks of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of the Russian Federation, said that there was a need to find “areas for interaction” with Russia.
Such areas, she said, must be found to “improve the two-way interaction”.
As an example of such successful cooperation, Nauert referred to the Armistice Agreement for Syria.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"And people all over the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the diplomat.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev’s claim of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said so, it certainly has the right to say it, but I can't say anything more about it," said the representative of the State Department.
Previously, US President Donald Trump had signed a bill to tighten the sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the Head of Government of the Russian Federation, Medvedev, said that Washington had declared Moscow a full trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that US sanctions would be in place for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister believes that Trump's U.S. student "smartly beat up."
The guy who was missing in Pod-Moscow was found at another man's house, who lost his memory.
Bodibilder Shamil Hanmetov went missing on the road to Noginsk on 25 July under very picky circumstances: he left the car's lounge to go to the toilet.
Seven days later, he was unluckyly searched for by acquaintances and locals.
And there was Chamele on the street in Ramenski.
He was found completely naked in his toilet owner.
A Dougestan sportsman was unable to explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was missing.
Announcing his missing person was used to identify the identity.
Doctors who have been on the bell have found a partial memory loss and a brain injury in Hanmetov, reports the Massh public.
Athletes may also have other surprises.
The intruders who abducted Chamil may have already been to his apartment, the keys of which were also stolen from him.
Oil and gas revenues in July outperformed the forecast by 7.4 billion roubles
In fact, the oil and gas revenues from July 2017 outperformed an estimate of 7.4 billion roubles, reports the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, the agency explains, was due mainly to a higher exchange rate of the United States dollar per ruble than the monthly average of June used to estimate, as well as to the excess of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of oil exports at the projected levels.
“The deviation of the federal oil and gas revenue from the monthly evaluation in line with the Federal Budget Act for the period 2017-2019 is projected to be +40.2 billion roubles in August 2017,” states a report by the Department of Public Information.
Thus, the total amount spent on the purchase of foreign exchange on the domestic currency market between 7 August and 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion roubles.
As a result, the daily volume of foreign exchange purchases will be equivalent to 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.
Every working day during this period, the BC will enter into foreign-exchange purchases on the organized tenders of the Moscow Exchange on an even-handed basis during the course of the trade day.
The acquired foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist underscores that Mexico is becoming more and more dangerous.
The weekly newspaper Riodos usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa State related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about safety.
They were told to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children to an office where a grenade was already thrown in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the table in the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They asked the reporters to give names for each column - no proof, no suspicions, no inner senses will be enough.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held by the government or cartels, a list of scumbags who make it dangerous to cover the chaos in Mexico.
The violence has not given rise, and there are more and more journalists in the country: according to the Committee for the Defence of Journalists, no less than 25 since President Henrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people, after the attacks and threats, have been under federal protection; and this year, at least seven people have been killed in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspirator, co-founder of the Riodos, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," he wrote in one of his many books on violent drug-related crimes.
His absence is very acute, although his presence is everywhere - a big picture of Valdez, displaying his middle finger, with the sign "Justice" on the front of the Riodos building; two reporters in the 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smile, his face in his glasses, or his brand panama.
The seminar is held less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although an office of a special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, so far, according to the Committee for the Defence of Journalists, only two cases have been investigated.
As in the case of most of the thousands of homicides committed every year in connection with drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Journalists in Riodos insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they have been slain with grief, even though it's much more dangerous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice from talking about the security at the meetings, it's not good enough, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to spend time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
In the morning of May 15, Waldes left the office of Riodos in Kuliakana State.
He was only able to pass a couple of blocks before his red Toyota was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "the 12th River."
The shooter left in his car and hit it in the vicinity.
Waldes was 50 years old.
He still has a wife and two adult children.
Rumours tend to split up on Kuliacán fast.
But there's almost no one talking about Waldes.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill the resulting vacuum.
Let us not say that one or more people are being killed every day in the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is full of two-story mausoleums of drug kings, which are more than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a moment that a state of "serenity" is just when one of the cartels takes control of a maritime state with important ports and drug routes in the United States.
Despite this, and the fact that Waldes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, was crushed by guilt for failing to protect a friend.
He thinks it's two wrongs to kill him.
First, an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, who is at war with the sons of Guzman, was published in February.
The publication might have angered the sons; the people who were allegedly gang members bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second error was that he didn't force Valdés to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper was seized, which was writing about the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was viewed as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been out of danger for so long, and his friends and coworkers thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroste, and in 2003, he, along with five co-workers, founded Riodos, selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was not possible to do journalism without the subject of drugs," said Bohorkes.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for being brave and fair in publishing, selling, and advertising.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censoring, and readers were drawn to the fact that they could read about what no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its foundation, Riodos won a prestigious award to Maria Moores Cabo for her Latin American reportership.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Prize for Courage in the Mexican Drug Trade, no matter where it went.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ award.
The Sinaloa drug trade is "this is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompepiento TV.
"You have to accept the tasks that lie on you as a journalist - either that or you're just fooling around."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there was so much death... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The staff of Riodos misses Valdés, a joker who scolded like a port porter, a friend who was generous in hugs and tips, a teacher who knew how to fight alive.
They relied on the order they had put in place.
He was always supposed to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, a bar in front of the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask, "Has love for one order destroyed him?"
His death led them to question how to do their job better and to stay alive.
"They don't like it when you know about their wives, their kids, their legal business, and their underground airports to transport drugs.
"These things were beyond the line," said Bohorkes.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-sustainability.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says the editor of "Riodos" Andres Villareal, is that "beating can be fooled... and then what happened to Javier."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer work in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states, where there is a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions, and corrupt officials.
Landscape changes all the time.
In the room where the Riodos met for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to bring mobile phones, and a few days earlier it was known that spying programmes, which were sold exclusively to Governments, were being used in Mexico to monitor journalists and social activists.
Outside, two policemen are hiding in the shadow of a tree from a 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They have been assigned by the state government to guard the office of Riodos, which is located in a four-story building in the Bourgeois district of Kuliakana.
Some journalists in the middle of a joke asked if the police officers were part of the 50 per cent of the members of the police who the Governor himself said could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that was de facto controlled by drug gangs.
In the nearest issue of Riodos, it was based on three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of Julio Cesar Chávez's brother, a former boxing champ.
They also had to expose government spending, which was concentrated in the Governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of Kuliacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the DA's office.
There was no official announcement of who was abducted or how it happened, so care had to be taken when it was time to write that everyone in the city knew that it was the favorite restaurant at the same time as the drug dealers and the authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a policy of the ruling Revolutionary and Institutional Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of government for almost the last century.
A number of PRI governors have recently been the subject of high-profile allegations of corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of El Chapeau Guzman escaped the military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for a column of Waldes with the most reliable information on the kidnapping.
"Before we'd know what happened," says 46-year-old Villareal, for his skinny bodywork, called El Flaco.
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources have been cut off."
Valdez's office is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, because the employees have become what they never thought to become: activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez picked up a number of posters and went to a local prosecutor's office show the next morning about another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in Michoacán in the west of the country three days after Valdez was killed.
They found the body burned down, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA.
Journalists all over the country began to speak up, organize protests, and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and the walls of the homes.
That day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., trying to get international support for the Valdez justice claim.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdes Ramirez, she accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then asked for no more tasks to cover the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Valdés has said many times that journalists in Mexico are “circumcised” by organized crime, its partners in government, and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Drug Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not being killed just by gangs of drug traffickers; they do so on the orders of politicians and security agencies in collusion with organized crime.
The Articulo 19 Press Protection Committee is of the view that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out on the orders of the police and Government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up," says Ramirez.
Of course, killing terrorizes people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Massias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
There was a note on her body supposedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones were next to her head cut off.
Some of the newspapers preferred to shut down, as the El North newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after her correspondent Miroslava Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on to the El Manyana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez made a public address to drug cartels by means of an editorial on the first page entitled "What do you want us to do?"
Some journalists have left their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
In exile, it is hard to find a job, and they still look out for danger on the street.
And sometimes they're killed, as apparently happened to a photographer, Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015, along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after he left Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance every day between risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits he's afraid to write about the drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I've become a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for press, the publishers of Riodos sat on the sidewalk next to the office and drank beer when their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the Masatlan resort city left, according to confirmed evidence, 19 dead.
The war continued to rage, as promised in a series of messages from the cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they put the news on the Riodos website via their mobile phone.
The next day, we had to redo the first page.
The sirens were picked up in the vicinity, another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes saw if the guards were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a massive picture of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was put on the lookout of all of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodos continued his work.
"How can you think about shutting down," said Bohorkes, "if on the very day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her out to do a report?"
Dinosaur used a camouflage to avoid his enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though it is horrifying.
The researchers said that the first found remains of an incredibly sized creature, found by a Canadian miner, were so well preserved that the experts called it "Mona Lisa among the Dinosauriers."
It was so well preserved that they could even determine that the color of his scavenged skin was redish-brown – and say that he had, in a way, a "dark past."
In a report published in Modern Biology, it was described as “the best preserved in the history of Tireophorus and one of the best copies of a dinosaur in the world”.
It is a fossil, a recently found copy of a nodosaurus in the middle of the chalk period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly good state stunned the researchers, who call it “very remarkable. ”
This herb-eating thyreophorus is the most well-preserved fossil of this kind in the history of the discovery, according to the National Geographic.
It was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the Sancorh Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in North Albert, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled on something that seemed different from the surrounding rock, and decided to look at it more closely.
The fossil he found was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, an animal was found inside a ground depth of 2,500 feet (100 kg).
Now that all this hard work is done, the complete result can be shown.
"It's just a bit of a squealing, and you can almost believe he's sleeping," said the lead author, Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tirell Museum of Paleontology, where the creation is shown.
"He will enter the history of science as one of the prettiest and most well-preserved dinosaurs, Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs."
In a study of his skin, researchers found that it was herbal, even though it was covered with a shell and was like a walking tank, and it was likely to be a major threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful shell-covered Dinosaurier used red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators, and used protective techniques, known as protective colors, which are also used by many animals in our day.
This would make it possible for him to blend in more quickly with the environment and avoid meeting the enemies, say the experts, presuming that he was being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This creature, which is 110 million years old, has been widely publicized in the press in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tirell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have already studied the animal and given it the name of Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the museum lab, Mark Mitchell, one of the band members who spent more than 7,000 hours after his painstaking excavation.
The surprising preservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the drawing and shape of the scales and the pancreas on his body.
They found a protective color, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although protective coloring is very common, the discovery has become a surprise, as the size of the Dinosaurier Borealopelta is much greater than the size of the living animals with a protective color.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so heavily hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred the camouflage of confrontation as a way to survive.
But most modern animals with protective colors – such as reindeer, zebra, or armored mantles – are much smaller and are more accessible, indicating that nodozaur has had to struggle hard to survive.
"The serious threat from predators to a massive, powerful shell-covered Dinosaurier shows how dangerous the predatory mercenarisms of the Measles were," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the husk of a dinosaur also indicates that his skin was to be red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They think that when the dinosaur died, he fell in the river and was taken to the sea, where he sank and his back down to the bottom of the ocean.
In those days, Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and the rivers and oceans are likely to have spread farther into the land than they are now.
“This nodosaurus is indeed remarkable in that it is completely covered by the remaining shaved skin, while at the same time being completely preserved in three dimensions, while preserving the original form of the animal,” said Brown.
"As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it was then, in the early chalk period.
You don't have to use your imagination to re-create it, you just need to snuggle a little bit, and you can almost believe he's sleeping.
The mellow period is an era in which giant theropods, carnivorous, two-legged dinosaurs, wandering around the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, lived a million years later than the Borealopelta, one of his fearsome ancestors may have hunted a thyreophorus.
These include the acrocantosaurus, a monstrosity of 38 feet (1.5 meters) and a six-ton weight.
Scientists, whose latest discoveries are published in Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after his death and mutilated in the sea.
The creature was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the millenium mine near Fort McMurray in North Albert, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it's the world's most well-preserved thyreophorus, along with the skin and the shell, and it's still, from the face to the femur.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (5 meters) in length and weighed up to 3000 pounds (300 kg).
Their hallmark was two 20-inch spikes out of their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herb - edible thyreophorus has been hard on what is now Canada, until the spilled river has taken it to the open sea.
But the underwater grave of the dinosaur kept his shell to the slightest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular copy have been so well preserved that the skin remains still cover the bulwark pancreas along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Gresko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, the degree of security is “several as a lottery win.
The longer I look at it, the more astonishing it is.
Fossil fragments of the skin still cover the ragged pancreas that surround the animal's skull.
His right foreleg is stretched along the side, with five fingers on it turned upside down.
I can count the scales on his sole."
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without an I.D.
Mikhail Saakashvili, a former head of Georgia, and then Odessa State in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
In doing so, he did not have the documents to prove his identity and nationality.
Saakashvili's arrival is reported by the Polish Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his performance on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili addressed an event to mark the anniversary of the Warsaw Revolt against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not know Polish, even though he was trying to start a speech in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish interpreter.
In his speech, the politician addressed the subject of Georgia's cooperation with Poland, as well as Ukraine.
That the Ukrainian Migration Service had deprived him of his citizenship, the opposing politician found out when he was in the United States.
It is not yet known how he was able to make an undocumented trans-Atlantic flight.
The former Governor of Odessa oblast, Mikhail Saakashvili, had previously stated that his signature on the application form for the acquisition of Ukrainian citizenship had been forged.
The politician stressed that he had not completed any forms.
The investigation of the Wynzeher and Olkhovik case has been extended until January.
The pre-trial investigation of the co-owner of the group of Renova, Yevgeny Olkhovik, and the head of the T Plus energy holding, Boris Weinzeher, was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court is considering the extension of the accused ' s house arrest.
The UK representative at the meeting reported on the decision to extend the pre-trial investigation for the last time.
“The particular difficulty and length of the investigation is due to the need to seize and test a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigations on the territory of several constituent entities of the Russian Federation”, the investigator stated.
He added that the suspects regularly bribed the Comi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion roubles.
According to the investigation, Wynzeher, Olhovik, as well as Mikhail Slobodin, the former head of the Central Energy System, who led the company Vimpelcom until 5 September, have been handing over bribes to senior officials of the Republic of Komi for setting the highest possible rates for thermal and electrical power, as well as for creating an enabling environment for business.
Wynzeher and Olkhovik were detained, staged in Siktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped from the investigation and was reported to a federal search.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question "Who Streets? "
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the depths of her heart.
Just a day after her arrival in New York on a tourist trip, St. Louis was sitting on a bed in an apartment leased via Airbnb, looking at a Facebook tape on her phone.
She ran into someone from high school.
It said, "Police just killed an 18-year-old kid, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
After noting that none of her tapes had ever posted this information, which was puzzled, she closed off Facebook and Twitterd.
There was a lot of posting in her tape with @TheePharaoh.
A rapper from the Greater St. Louis, in real time, tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of Brown's lifeless body, spread out in the street, where it would be for four hours.
"It's wild," Ferrel thought.
But death was not new to her and her circle.
She put off her phone, and later in the evening, she went back to the tweets about people getting on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of signal tape and people yelling and a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who had a poster saying, "The Ferguson cop just killed my unarmed son!"
She was watching a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another cop, she said, pulled the trigger of a rifle and yelled, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals!"
"This is a non-standard situation," said Ferrel, by his own memory.
"This is not a murder like the one we're used to and we can call it typical.
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was mad and weeping."
She took a flight back and went home the next day.
Landed at 11:00 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson in the next three years was the theme of a new documentary film, "Who Streets?", to be released on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and perseverance from the point of view of the people who live in the community and fill the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrell was on her way to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower dress and a wreath of color, they remembered a conversation that had been held up to this morning countless times, “on the experience of blacks and their situation.
She remembers saying, "Remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now, because a cop killed an 18-year-old boy, and it was wrong.
"I couldn't help but take it," said Ferrel later.
“What is happening today is the climax of what has happened before.
She has to know about it, see it, and learn from it.
It must not only be well-informed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black people's experience and status, and what we must do to be free to be free.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she herself will not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done her a bad favor if I had kept her out of it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, the first stop they made on South Florida Road, on a site across the street from a police station that was a sort of camp camp, while the activists were waiting for reports of Officer Darren Wilson's total non-indictment.
There Ferrel and his daughter joined a local businessman who was making lunch packets.
They packed up the packets and helped hand them out to protesters.
A little bit in Ferrel's mind has found the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism has completely changed since August 9,” she said, noting that, as a student at Missouri-Saint-Louis University, she was the president of the Association of Nurses, National Minorities, and engaged in food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
"I didn't have the experience of an organizator.
This has come on its own."
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Foleyan, one of her co-directors.
Foleyan said that she and her main operator, Lucas Alvarado-Ferre, "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrel came up with the question, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?"
This scepticism has been engendered by a number of people, often white, who have come to the community to benefit from his pain and endurance.
As Foleyan explained in a recent interview, "We have heard that the voices of people who were born and grew up in Ferguson are not getting the focus of attention, and we wanted to do it differently."
The Folyan had by then joined with her co-director, Damon Davis, a local artist, who was known to be active on the death penalty.
His participation created sympathies for the project with Ferrel and with the six locals with whom the Team of the “Which Streets?” project has been in touch for years since Brown was killed.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, we say it ourselves," Davis said.
"It was the most important thing to me, as these people will be represented, because it is how I will be represented."
And while the project was not to focus on Ferrel’s experience – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the leader-pattern, but about how the community is united, ” as Foleyan said, it was the most open of the film’s participants.
As a result, "Who Streets?" displays the unexpected personal aspects of Ferrel's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrel, laughtering about the first time I saw a finished product.
"But I realized that when you do this job and humanize blacks, you have to have some level of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's history rediscusses and emphasizes the role of a black gay woman in the wider context of the Black Life Movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- the ones who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after the murder of a black teenager, Treyvon Martin, in 2012 -- are considered to be gay.
"Black gay women in leadership are supporting all this movement," says Ferrel. "And all because we're always fighting on a number of fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all this burden.”
Folyan agreed with this statement, noting that “the movement is in fact supported by black women and a wide range of gay black women”.
However, she insists that “this is not a case of positive discrimination” and that Ferrel was not selected as the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
"She was the man who woke up this energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that she was in the first place, because when."
You can sense her energy through the screen."
In the meantime, there have been no cameras in Ferguson for a long time, but there are still complex racial links between the community and the police.
Ferrel will be on probation for another two and a half years for blocking the road during the demonstration.
It describes the social and political atmosphere of a place called home, just "Bardak."
She's still holding on to the talk she learned when she got out on Ferguson Street three years ago.
We have to fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.
Two Salvadoran footballers disqualified for biting US players.
The footballers of El Salvador, Henri Romero, and Darwin Serene, received long-term disqualifications for unsportable behaviour.
During a quarter-final match, the North American-Caribbean Football Confederation (CONCACAF) was bitten by Salvadorans.
First, Henry Romero's protector.
The Salvadoran bit the attacker, Josie Altidor, and then pinched him by the chest.
Serene, a mid-defendant, was then bitten by Omar Gonzalez, a United States defender, when he served an angular in his square.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches, and serene for six.
The meeting itself ended with a win by the Americans with a 2-0 score, handing over Goal.com.
There's a resemblance: an artist is making portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA.
In the middle of the hall in Friedman Hall in New York City, people's faces are hanging out with the ceiling on the wire -- white, black, and brown, all of them inconceivable.
These 30 portraits were made by the painter Heather Dewey Harborg from the swabs of her cheeks and the hair trims sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent trims from Fort Levenworth, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition on August 2 is called "The Rise of Affinity."
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art brings together technology, informatics, and art, and Manning, a transsexual woman and a prominent dissenting woman, who Barack Obama commuted her sentence just three days before the end of her presidency.
Analysing DNA from Manning's computer program and using it to make three-dimensional portraits of people with such a genome, Dewey Harborg created a deep, though not easy, manifesto about not only the plasticity of DNA data - the different ways in which they are interpreted and the ingenious determinism of these interpretations - but also the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born in the name of Bradley Edward, but who was a teenager who openly said she was a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Spy Act, computer fraud, and theft.
Her picture in the prison was not available, so there was only one picture of her: a grainy black-and-white selfie, where Manning in the platinum color of a wig, clearly uncomfortable, was driving a car, and this picture was associated with it.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg successfully completed his 2012 project, Visions of Strangers.
In it, an artist created images of unknown people using forensic evidence such as cigarettes and gum gum, extracting DNA from this rubbish, and creating images of how these people might look.
And that's when she got an e-mail from the Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a picture to illustrate the article," she explained to Dewey-Hagborg at a pre-show of a new press exhibit.
At the time, Chelsea was not allowed to go and take a picture, so they contacted her and asked her if she wanted to get a picture of her DNA.
In this unusual way, the painter and her incarcerated muse have become friends by letter and have exchanged a number of letters for two years.
They even wrote a comic book, "Depressed Images", illustrated by Choili Kanungo, who pictured how the president would lighten Chelsea's punishment in the future and be able to attend the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book was out of the world was a welcome surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There's something deep and strong about the show opening right now, when Donald Trump is declaring war to people who tell secret information in the government, and inventing new ways to stir up the rivalry he's supposed to soften on Twitter.
When Dewey Harborg was asked about the timing of all this, she said, "Nothing happens."
In a statement by an artist on the wall of the galley, Manning's massive signature at the bottom (with a heart over "i" in her name) calls for an end to the "automatic division based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the other hand, her mitochondrial DNA, a long russet of pencil C, G, and A.
Using 200 letters (or nucleotides, as a scientifically exquisitely expressed by an artist), Dewey Harborg was hoping to show us how surprisingly similar we are, in any case, by our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open the genetic data is for interpretation, and how subjective it is," said Dewey Harborg; her 2007 video work "Fog Memory" is also here.
"The DNA can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here."
The last part of the show in the same room is the novel in the comics mentioned above.
It features Manning in King Kong style over the United States Correctional Cazarm with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they'll win," it says.
"So don't ever shut up."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says an artist welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I'm still freaking out when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't seen the show in person - as it was visually pictured in the comics - but when it comes, it'll be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genome simulators, as a crowd of protesters.
It's also premeditated, just like everyone at the exhibition up to the height (5"2, Manning's height), where the pencil was drawn by genetic helogroups.
"Before I'd put them on the walls, but now I want them to look like a crowd of people," says Dewey Harborg about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like a mass movement that shaped around Chelsea, like a movement that stood behind her release."
Professor of Northwestern University and a staff member of Oxford University, wanted by the police for murder
According to the police, a national raid is under way on a Northwest University professor and an Oxford University employee, who are wanted as suspects for having been found dead in a luxurious room in Chicago.
According to the Cook County Court records, a warrant was issued on Monday for premeditated murder without the right to be released on bail from 40-year-old Wyndham Latham and 50-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the records, the 20-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after he was hit with multiple stabbing wounds.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was found on 27 July.
The police got a call, went to the Grand Plasa complex, and found the victim with a number of wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and the detectives are now investigating the death from stab wounds, considering her to be a murder, while the police are looking for two suspects.
Latham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwest since 2007.
Alan C. Kabbage, Vice-President of the University of Liaison, stated in an e-mail application that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was not allowed to go to Northwestern University campus.
“This is a criminal case that is being investigated by the authorised persons, and the University of North West is cooperating with the investigation,” said Kabbaj.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
A representative of the University and Somerville College, in an e-mail application, said, "We have been in contact with the British Police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. Investigative Authorities."
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to give up.
The Chicago Police Chief of Liaison, Anthony Gullelli, said he was very encouraging the suspect to turn himself in to the authorities.
“The police have any idea where they are, but our attempts to find them are getting worse,” Guillemi said.
According to Guillemi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
Guillemi said that the police called the manager of the Grand Plasa Building, who had just received a mysterious report that something was going on in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene terrible.
Guillemi stated that it was not clear whether the incident had taken place on 27 July.
According to him, the data from the videos confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We think Professor Latham and the victim were in a relationship,” Guillemi said.
The Grand Plasa Manual issued an address to the residents, which stated: “The police are currently working on a chronology of the incident, gathering information about the victim, and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
Russian vice-premier Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the VADA Road Map in the near future."
Russian vice-premier Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be met in the near future.
“A stage in the implementation of the requirements has been completed, and RUSADA has been given the right to plan and run the tests in conjunction with the UKAD (Anti-Doping Agency of the United Kingdom).
The BADA Road Map was updated accordingly,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the Road Map of WADA to reinstate compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of the work of RUSADA and has recently been published on the organization ' s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that would present a problem for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future,” he added.
But one of the requirements on the list is that the Russian anti-diping structures should publicly accept the results of the VADA-ordered investigation of Canadian jurist Richard McLaren, who claimed that doping in Russian sports was controlled by the state.
On this subject, Mutko said, "We are investigating, as our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there have been no government programs, and we will not accept what has not happened."
Mutko echoed the words of William Smirnov, head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of the Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged the previous problems in the Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to take this report, without a doubt,' Smirnov added.
WADA removed RUSAD from doping control in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
In June this year, however, he was allowed to plan and coordinate the test under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After a visit to the Moscow office of the organization in July, Olivier Niggley, Director-General of WADA, stated that RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” to re-establish its work.
The fire in the 79-story tower in Dubai has been extinguished.

It is noted that firefighters have been able to cope with all fires by 4:00 local time (3.00 msk).
The local authorities reported no injuries as a result of the incident.
As the fire was extinguished, the streets surrounding the skyscraper were closed down.
The cause of the incident is not yet known.
It has been reported that there is a 79-story skyscraper in Dubai, the Torch, which is one of the highest buildings in the world.
All the tenants were evacuated on time.
The unimaginable robe of the Booze shaken the fans: trousers that don't cover the panties
Olga Bouzova, a skandal host of the "Dom 2" reality show, hit the viewers of the Europa Plus Live festival with a dance in her underwear.
In front of thousands of fans, a new singer with a duet from Nasty Cudry sang the song "We're gonna be hot."
The two girls went up on the stage in a provocative "blums" so that the underwear of the singers turned out to be in the open.
Buzova and Cudry were inscriptions on their trousers.
In the past, it has been reported that the changes in the appearance of Bouzova have been commented on by a specialist in a Moscow Plastic Surgery Clinic.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
On Friday, 4 August, Radio 4 reported it to the news service, with links to foreign media.
He said that it was the Russian authorities who were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and “destabilisation in eastern Ukraine”.
Still, Stoltenberg assured us that a dialogue with Russia was possible, and that a further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of the participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump stated that the US-Russia relationship was at a dangerously low level, and he blamed the US Congress for it.
The Yekaterinburg metro is learning a new way to pay.
In October, it would be possible to pay a bank card for a trip to the ekaterinburg subway, as said by the CEO of the UAO "I-Net" Pavel Vedernikov in an interview with the State Gazette.
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 World Cup the same system of subway fares as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nis Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, the guests of the Mundial, to use the subway with their bank cards, without getting tokens or standing in line," he said.
Starts that will help your company not become another Uber
Aimee Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among his startup staff in the area of electronic commerce, but the polls didn't work.
The answers were often vague, pointless, or, worse, untrue.
And even though she promised anonymity, some staff didn't trust the process.
“He has never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, the manager of a 75-person company in San Francisco, “Madison Reed, an e-commerce company in the area of hair care.
She therefore sought assistance from third parties.
A new type of start-up in the area of staff is now emerging, helping companies to find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licenseing software, which is designed to measure the involvement of staff members, they enable companies to make prompt inquiries, to refer to certain teams and population groups, to offer staff anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and, in some cases, to allow whistle-blowers to pass down the top management and to address the directorate directly.
"Now we have such tools as Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, and where is Fitbit for your company? ", says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Glint startup in Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
Errett told us that she has gained a better understanding of what her staff think and feel in three years of Glint use.
In addition to the express polls and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a company's thermal map and illustrates which units have more complaints and which managers have a low rating of approval, so that it can understand why.
The companies are a bit aware of the need to control the workplace, or they will become the next Uber, who was involved in the scandal when a former employee posted a blog that described the aggressive environment in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For start-ups like "Glint", this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for profit-making business.
The “Let's Talk About Pay” Internet Portal, dedicated to financial technology, estimates that the global governance, regulation, and alignment industry can cost over $118.7 billion by 2020.
The "Convercent" start from Denver, Colorado, helping companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a small increase in interest and activity earlier this year against the background of the fall in Uber's reputation.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber has recently emerged as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized interviews of the staff's views, to collect confidential responses in real time, and to view thermal maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages, which allows staff to report bad behaviour.
And if the top manager is involved, the complaints go straight to the office.
“The court of public opinion has overtaken the powers of the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company is not treating the staff or acting unethically, even if the inspector does not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of client boycotts, staff outflows, and lawsuits, Queenlan reported.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, has used Convercent for over a year to make sure that the staff are aware of the rules and procedures, and to suggest a simple way to contact the company's head office.
In the past, if the staff member wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look for a phone number or a head office e-mail, file an official complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a frightening and awkward experience, reported James Vitrano, the head of the legal office of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to follow up on the staff's complaints.
Now, when the company is using Convercent, the problems that used to be hidden from office managers in other cities or states – such as discrimination, charisma, and unfair pay – can be detected and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to a complete, comprehensive understanding of the situation of the staff,” said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Team of Ruby Tuesday.
“And we are protecting our shareholders from legal proceedings with the staff.”
According to Queenland, companies began to take the ethics, values, and involvement of employees more seriously in 2002, after Arthur Andersen’s accounting firm collapsed on account of ethical irregularities as a result of the Dela Enron.
But it was only when “social networks have become massively common,” that the companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from viral distribution on the net.
“Before starting to use technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both "Glint" and "Conversent" offer their software as a service, charging companies regularly for the use of their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that won the approval of venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, "Conversent" received $10 million in funding from firms such as "Sapphire Ventures" and "Tola Capital", bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly astonishing given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of research has shown that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they used to do.
In markets with strong competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages, and interesting projects, they are just the necessary minimum.
The employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they are devoting their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in a company, feel that they are being heard, and that the work they do is a result, they're trying to make such a company a success,” says Nina McQueen, the vice-president for global benefits and satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors receive income when business from their portfolio goes well; business from companies goes well when employees are loyal and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase the commitment and involvement of staff, it is not surprising that they find support.
In the workplace, culture experts argue that it is important to have data on the involvement of staff.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback, it can give the impression that a change is coming.
And if changes don't come fast enough, or if they don't come at all, there can be frustration, and the staff lose interest.
“If you're going to ask for 4,000 offers, you have to be ready to hold 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Rut, president of the management firm of Kotter International, who had to see companies make a mistake, relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't go to the end, the staff will wonder, "Do you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why don't I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly staff interviews, is in a position to take action on the same day that someone reports the problem with the help of Glint.
And after gathering feedback from the staff, dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize a number of teams within the company and introduce a communication training to address the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is learning new things about its employees and hopes that in the long run it will be able to more effectively retain its staff in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose clients.
And if you lose your clients, you lose your company.
In Barnaul, they open a new asphalt on the Krasno-Armee Prospect.
Barnaul has taken major steps to address the cause of the failure of the Asphalt in the Krasno-Armee Prospect.
The place where the holes on the newly inflationed carriageway (the junction with the street of the young) have been created twice has been decided to open up.
Let us recall that the collapse of a small section of the road in the vicinity of the tramway was due to the swelling of the land in an unsustainable network.
According to Ivan Garmat, the Vice-Chairman of the City Committee on Road Management, Upgrading, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be carried out for a detailed survey and the elimination of the preconditions for the collapse.
Depending on the results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that the shell of unsustainable communications will need to be rebuilt and concreted.
This is reported on the official website of the capital.
The Breens team has to work longer because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled the training twice a day.
The time is approaching at 11:00 p.m.; a crowd of footballers from the University of California in Los Angeles is being held up to chat on one side of the team's new campus training field.
Some of them pulled off their t-shirts with their backs bare, shining from the sweat after the stressful first day of the sports camp.
For many of the team's players, these moments of idleness are a break in the middle of the day.
After three hours of training, the gamers will go back to the dorms to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning they will return to the Wasserman Football Center to meet at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, the coach of the Breens team, Jim Mora, said, "The next three days, these guys are gonna have a chopper."
The fact that the National Student Athletics Association cancelled the training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on the players, actually extended their working day – at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
So the start of the first three trainings at the University of California in Los Angeles was set at 7.15 p.m. to fit in with the already dense player schedule.
The side effect of the lack of two trainings a day has been more days with one training, and Bruins is moving the start of the camp for almost a week from last year and is conducting summer school training for the first time in the six Sea seasons in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to do 18 trainings up to and including August 20, before starting the formal preparations for the first game in the season against the Texas A&M team in September.
Maura said he was in favour of a change of rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that he made another point in the game's dense schedule.
"For three or four days, we're giving them this massive burden, it's a big test," said Maura.
"And they just overcame it, they're working, they're great kids.
I think that when we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's gonna be really cool."
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make the training closed; this is not an easy task, since its fields are in direct view from the nearby parking lot and from the next Laskin Center, a dear hotel, which has been bombed with footballs that have overcame the protective net outside the gate.
Players from Bruins have to borrow a hotel from this weekend, but Maura admits that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
"We're gonna have security," Maura said.
"This is a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger, assuming that someone can get a room, sit there and record the training in a video.
If you have a video of the training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security at Parking Number 8.
We'll do what we can with what we have.
I'm not gonna be too worried about it.
We have a plan."
All the victims of the attack in St. Petersburg have been discharged from hospitals
All the victims of the attack in the subway of St. Petersburg in April have been discharged from hospitals.
This was reported to the press office of the vice-governor, Anna Mithanina.
At the end of July, three people remained in the infirmary, handing over the TV Center.
To recall, the explosion in the subway of St. Petersburg took place on April 3, this year.
The bomb was bombed by a suicide bomber, Akbarjon Jalilov.
The attack killed 15 people, as well as the perpetrator.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer of Abror Asimov, have been arrested.
Let us recall that the previous day, Rostpresnadznadzor recommended that the metropolitan of St. Petersburg review the transport security plan, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook reinforces the fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts that are suspicious of mysticism to independent experts, and show their opinions under original postings, on Thursday, the world's largest social network, which is trying to combat so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible mysticalities, send them to the test, and possibly show the results of the fact-checking under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main means of disseminating so-called faking news, which, in the view of many, has had an impact on the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue is also under active debate in Europe after French voters have been misled by false reports before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany, before the September elections, they have expressed support for a plan to fine social media if they do not quickly remove hate posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook announced a test of a new fact-checking algorithm, which was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which messages are challenged by independent checkers, people want to have a wider context to make sound judgements about what they read and what they share," writes Sarah Sue, the Facebook news manager.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of "linked articles" and work on other changes in the news feed to address the problem of online news.
Create a novel-comic: One lock in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's small castle was filmed in a music video called "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s served as a shelter for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy spot in the Bule Valley in Kent County, he was watching a turbulent history around, and now he inspired Jamie Rhoades, a yorkshire with a filthy hair and a tendency to have a history, to a Roman-comics.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says.
"You feel it in person when you hold this letter in your hand."
"The Castle in England" ranges from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and speaks of families who lived in Scotty; each story is illustrated by a young British artist, Isaac Lenkevich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhoades, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "The Tooths of a Dead Man and Other Stories", a collection of British Library records; this project suddenly touched him to the depths of his heart.
"I could have just been touched by a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites," he says.
"This is his fingerprint."
And the emails always smell like smoke, because in those days the light was lighted up.
And in 300 years, in the future, you think you're there too.
Ah, I love the archives!"
For a man who has such a passion for old papers, to receive support from the National Foundation and the English Arts Council, and to live in a castle for four months ("I've been a bit there") seems too good to be true.
Rhoades spent all day studying the "new" Victorian lock, walking through the archives, and looking at a lot of property treasures and antique things -- like the head of hyena on the walls or the bottles of centuries in the shatter.
He was walking through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to the foresters, the gardeners, and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations to his book.
Then at night, he "dranks whiskey and sits down to write."
The history of the Castle of Scotty is not very well known, because the National Foundation was not able to gain full access to it until 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassy, died.
When Rhoades arrived ten years later, the staff was just beginning to deal with the archive, which he described as "what the aristocrats have been down in the attic for centuries."
The journals, the British Empire e-mails, the charts showing who owned what you think land disputes are boring, Rhoades says, but two families have been fighting for this berth.
You know, it's like that, guys!"
In some of the history of the compilation, the lock is becoming a starting point for the wider search in English history: for example, in "The Workman", the hero is leaving the newly built lock to join the Christian Revolution of 1381.
"There is evidence of a mutiny that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called "The knightly families of Kent and Sussex," Rhoades says.
"The Crusade Revolt began in these places, and I thought the revolt was a good start.
Maybe they were bound."
Other narratives are closely related to the history of the castle, such as the Priest, which speaks of the Jesuit priest, whom the Darryl family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Smuggling" about an 18th-century smuggler, Arthur Darryl, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (this was found a few years later when the coffin was dug up).
The Darrells are the favorite family of Rhoades who lived in Scotty: "The Gentlemans seem to have been a complete scam, always in debt, and spend money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darryl men have been able to solve their debt problems by marrying rich old women -- I imagine them as a company of pretty guys who know how to take care of the heirs of big fortunes."
After completing his work at Castle Rhoades, he's looking for other ways to get a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the countryside, where he wrote a graphical novel about Elimenmeki, a place where there was a sanatorium at the beginning of the 20th century, and then it fell back into the woods.
But Scotty is still a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he said.
"I felt like, damn it, I have to go back to my real life."
The top 15 banks choose Russia.
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, TBT, TB24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhosbank, Binbank, and FC Open, another seven credit organizations are about to leave this public organization.
Thus, no less than 80 per cent of the market will be the share of out-of-area organizations.
But this is not just an option - all the banks that have declared a break-up with the ADB are negotiating with another social organization that brings together credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks, Russia, led by a well-known politician, Anatoli Aksakov, the Chairman of the State Committee on the Financial Market, recognized, by the end of the last session, and the most effective head of the Domestic Committee, and a member of the number of draft laws.
The outbreak of the conflict within the ARB was a part of the Federation Council ' s discussion, when the Inter-Regional Banking Council was considering new draft laws, including a new classification of banks according to the size of the capital of the statute.
At that time, Gareguin Tosunyan, President of the ARB, said that the association considered the bill to be in the interest of the major banks, which were thus trying to limit the capacity of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clients.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which, in Tosunyan ' s view, did not always justify the withdrawal of licenses from some banks, which was, of course, subject to an objection from the representative of the Central Bank: many of the heads of the bank, such as the External Bank, were part of the ADB ' s governing bodies.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment has become a visible reason for the 15 major banks to start to prepare for joining the association “Russia”, noting that “the effectiveness of the work of the ARB will be low, and a constructive dialogue within the banking community is in fact not taking place”.
The Treasurers will be better off.
How will this end?
Let us immediately answer the fundamental question that arises in the event of the slightest failure or conflict in or near the banking sector: the depositors are not at risk, but rather the credibility of the banking system will be improved.
He is the head of Russia, Anatoli Aksakov, a high-level expert who is highly valued at the Central Bank, who is known for his sensibility in all the interests of banks and their clients: almost all the CB leadership is present at the annual events of the association, and all the relevant legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through expert assessments of the “regions”.
In terms of human resources and organization, there are also apparently no major shocks to be expected.
Undoubtedly, the ARB is in a difficult financial and management situation once such strong and powerful participants with their contributions and lobbying capabilities have been deprived.
However, this oldest organization, established in 1991, has the potential to continue to improve banking law and the area of monetary treatment in general.
It is not possible to say that in the association Russia, with open arms, they are ready to receive new members on any condition, according to the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("may be too much to want"), who, on 21 July, at a briefing to the parliamentary press center, stated that “literally the next day, the representatives of the Banks who have left the ARB have asked me to consider the possibility of building up the potential of our association Russia.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of the bankers in the Association's Council, as well as to give more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiating process is under way, the proposals of the two parties are under consideration, and an agenda for the association ' s Extraordinary Congress is being prepared, to be held in Sochi in mid-September, as part of an international banking forum.
That's where we'll find out.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, emphasizing that “the chair is not holding up,” called a possible new head of the renovated “Russia” association, George Luntovsky, who is leaving the post of Vice-President of the Central Bank in September, with a high degree of characterization of his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoli Aksakov, who is now resting in Crimea, is planning to break off his vacation for one day and to come to Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Russia Association Council, which is scheduled to consider the agenda for the “Russia Extraordinary Congress”.
The entry of gas-powered vehicles to the major cities of Russia will not be restricted
The deputy head of Mintrans, Nikolai Asaul, said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of gas-powered vehicles to the major cities of Russia would not be restricted.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to step up the environmental class.
And there, the concept goes straight to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, from what year?
It's the same as the slogans of the phrase - let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Shall we shut down the whole city?
"In 20 years - I don't know, maybe this will happen," quotes the Minister's "Prime."
The newspaper Izvestia previously reported that, by 17 August, Vice-Premier Arkady Dvorkovic had been instructed to study the proposals on possible options for the control of electric transport submitted to the Government by the CEO of PAO Kamaz, Sergey Koghin.
Among the suggestions, according to the newspaper, are the use of UXO vehicles in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a green card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump has announced that a new US immigration plan will be adopted to change the rules for getting a Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for temporary work visas, and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and are supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two Houses of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save the taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so by altering how the US delivers greencards to the citizens of other countries.
The Act will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will give advantage to the English-speakers, have the cash resources that enable them to support themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said, according to the American media.
Sex robots are real, and it should be bothering us.
Before we thought that the year 2017 could no longer get worse, a new report on technological progress in the production of sex robots was issued.
Yeah.
Sex robots are at the center of attention right now.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) has recently released a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5 to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharky, a well-deserved Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and FRR co-founder, we have to take them seriously.
Users can choose the color of the eye of the robots, the shape of the nipples, and the type of fingernails.
"People are giggling about it, but firms are already sending it to their users, and we're about to see a lot more of it," said Sharky at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable companions to robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and with almost human lines, which are controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robots by choosing everything from the color of the eye and the shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and color of the fingernails.
But the fact that a lot of robots have "personality" in comparison to which the Stepford Wife would seem very progressive is even more worrisome.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix Robot allows users to set up quality in robots that they find attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxy Gold sex robots, developed by "True Companion", which are supplied with an already-programmed identity, such as "Cold Farrah" being shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "smart" character.
"Roxxy Gold has a character that fits you well," the website "True Companion" exults.
So she loves what you love, doesn't love what you don't love, and so on.
She's in a different mood during the day, like a real man!
She can want to sleep or talk, or she can be in the mood!
The emergence of sex robots is a source of concern - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the most worrisome is the subservient image of a woman, an association with rape, which is causing the acquisition of the Cold (read, resisting) Farah.
On the "True Company" website, Roxxy is compared to a vibrator, for men only.
"If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxy?" said on the Web.
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and ever-growing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a shift from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex, subjecting to the option as an additive.
Most men, of course, will not be buying sex robots, and while FRR has their growing popularity, they are still at the periphery of consumer culture.
But what has come to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meaning of the era in which we live.
And many people are neither stupid nor aggressive until the free market gives them an opportunity to do so.
It's not a coincidence - that these complex sex robots are just when the rights of women around the world are at risk, when the White House has a president who braggs about what he's doing to women.
The scariest thing in the TV series, "The Story of the Servant," is not graphic images, twisted bodies, and ejected eyes, namely, how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it doesn't seem so big.
The purpose of the sex-robot industry is to bring about the physical likeness of real women (only with the ratio of porn stars) that technology can afford.
Their creators want them to look like humans, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's the robots that don't look like real women with their "characters."
They cannot break up with or leave their partners.
They don't have a life or a biography -- nothing that would point to independence or anything else that would destroy the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, they're beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, the maids.
A native of Los Angeles, Jeter, who has been a member of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which will start on August 31.
In an interview with the BeBasket Portal, the General Manager of the Blue-yellows, Andrey Lebedev, reported this.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately he's not coming for family reasons.
We're gonna go to the Eurobasket without a naturalized player, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will enable our young players to develop," he said.
With Jeter's direct participation, Ukraine's team peaked at number six in Eurobanket 2013 and first won the World Basketball Cup, where "yellow-blue" failed to break the group stage, and the United States national averaged 15.4 points per game, 3 picks and 5 assists.
Jeter has ceased to stand for Ukraine since he left the position of Chief Coach of our national team, Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
Men's Eurobasket-2017 will take place simultaneously in four countries: Finland, Turkey, Romania and Israel.
The Ukrainian team will hold their group tournaments on the Earth as promised.
There will be five contests in group B, with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3 September), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparations for the tournament, our male team held two test matches in which the Dutch and the Belarusians gave way.
Trump's grand feat?
To be Mita Romney seems very sensible.
In the Trump era, the commonplace was the fact that the political disputes that polarized the American electorate had broken up some families at the micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the American newspapers have been talking columns about how to deal with the terrible family who vote for Trump.
I think we're all so strained we're about to burst.
There's less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, the left-handed poet from Chicago, who's been on knives with the Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting in the fight against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knew, including her Republican brother, with whom she had been arguing about politics for decades, was suddenly and bizarrely on the same side.
At dinner, it's certainly good; but I can't help but think that in a wider context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump's inhaled the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we're talking about the unlikely possibility that one day we will not be hit by his actions.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the background of its standards, will suddenly prove to be a model of common sense.
I've caught myself missing Mitte Romney's old-fashioned madness today - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like) - compared to Trump and both seem very small.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candid will just be in his mind to see a big step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Parks Department, and the best way in the city to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are horrendous and massive, the images of glass fiber on the central drum - the grinding clowns and the pets, who, in a state of terror, look at their backs, are extremely vile, and the ringing music is, astonishing as it may be.
So many things in this city are frustrating: the species from the skyscrapers are getting old, the silhouettes of the buildings are too silhouette to cause trembling, and the reality of the city is not going to keep up with the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still going through the day I found out that the Suiss Cottage is not really a Swiss chalet (the "Ye Old Swiss Cottage" Thematic Puzzle) but a big roundabout in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two 40-year-old women can have a great time.
If I could put the carousel on the score, I'd put a five, but luckily, no one asked me to.
And at the department store this week, I was asked to evaluate my "experience" shopping on a scale of one to five stars before I put a card on the terminal.
In a coffee shop on the corner of my street, the same plus the option to keep a tip of 15% is for ordering at the counter.
As a result, not only does the neutral interaction slow down, but it also has to be personalized in a situation that does not involve it.
The poor lady at the department store was in a bad way smiling while I was tired of my five-star credit card experience.
Oskar Pistorius was transferred from prison to the hospital for chest pain.
Pistolius is leaving the prison for a second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of cartilage in the wrists, which the prison authorities claimed he was given as a result of a fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of premeditated murder following an appeal from the Public Prosecutor ' s Office for an initial sentence for manslaughter.
He killed Steencamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, shot her several times through the door of the toilet in his house in Pretoria.
Pistoryus said he thought his friend was a night thief hidden in his toilet.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office has indicated its intention to file another protest, this time against the six-year period of Pretoria, which, according to it, is too lenient.
The Attorney-General ' s Office stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be heard this year.
Pretoria may be extended by 15 years if the Public Prosecutor ' s Office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect in the beating of a NTV journalist has been selected for a non-removal subscription.
Capital law enforcement has selected a restraining measure in the form of a non-removal note for a man who attacked a NTV journalist, Nikito Roszajev, during live airing from Gorky Park on 2 August.
This is reported by TASS with a reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Irina Wolf.
“In the context of the investigation of a criminal case brought under article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (Bots) against a 32-year-old man who hit the face of a reporter of a TV station in the Central Park of Culture and Rest of the Name of Gorky, the suspect has been ordered to take a restraining measure in the form of a non-removal and proper conduct” the Wolf clarified.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative report had been drawn up on the suspect for insubordination to the police.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during live airing, a drunken man approached the reporter and hit the face.
As it later turned out, the bully had nothing to do with the UVC.
On the other hand, they tried to detain Moscow, according to Rhozzhaev himself.
Two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal tentage
According to BTW, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarians have been detained in Greece for illegal tentage.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people was arrested in Sitonia, who had placed tents in an uninstalted place, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, while the investigation is still under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed BTW that Bulgarians had been released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camping and have already imposed severe fines on all those who have been caught while parking in a place that is not available.
The tests will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may order a fine.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia has accused the US Vice-President of retorting during the Cold War.
The statements made during the European tour of US Vice-President Michael Pence were criticized by the Russian MID.
“Unfortunately, Washington is getting deeper into the primitive, ideological strains of the Cold War, which are completely detached from the reality,” states a statement by the Russian foreign government.
So at the MIDA, Pens's words about the “Russia threat” and the attempts to force the border to be closed, as he said in Podgorica.
The Russian MFA pointed to the destructiveness of the choice of “or with the West or with Russia” and the invisibility of the hypothesis of the alleged non-alternative entry of all South-East Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the US that had violated international law, using force to dispel Kosova from Serbia, and thus created another hotbed of tension.
“Inviting American colleagues to stop the scoffing at Russia and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and a willingness to work together in a constructive manner, on the mutual consideration of interests,” states the statement of the Russian MIDA.
Felder was hit by an ambulance in Podskovje.
The accident occurred in the Moscow Stupino, and a paramedic was hit by an inomarcus with an ambulance.
Today, about 08:10 a.m., a Mitsubishi car clashed with an ambulance in the city of Stupino, Moscow.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance has been overturned," said the TASS in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Moscow Region.
There are law enforcement officers at the scene of the accident, and the circumstances of the incident are being investigated.
In Odessa oblast, a woman threw her newborn son in the building, wrapping her in a cellophane bag.
On the evening of 3 August, the Division of Police received a report from a local resident that he found a bag of a baby in an unbuilt private home.
“At the scene of the incident, the law enforcement officers and the doctors, who promptly took the child to a medical institution,” the Odessa Chief of the National Police reported.
The doctor found that the boy was born a few hours before he was found, as indicated by the navel.
A 36-year-old local woman has been identified as having been given birth in priority investigative measures.
It has also been established that a woman has three other young children.
As the Chief noted, the family has not been placed in the field of law enforcement before, nor has it been placed on special account.
The police are currently setting out the circumstances and the reasons that led the woman to do so, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under the supervision of a doctor.
As previously reported, in Nikolayev, a 21-year-old woman threw her pre-mature child in the trash pipe.
Gregory Lepps: "I'm going to fight, though 55 isn't 30."
One of the most successful artists in Russia, Gregory Leps, will be celebrating his 55th birthday next Sunday.
Before the event, the singer spoke to the news columnist.
I remember your "Potkinnik" on the show.
A special tent in the Lunches, Gloria Gainor sang for the birthday boy, a strong salute over the Moscow River.
I bet you were pretending to spend your next five-year-old.
Plans come true?
As far as the profession is concerned, it was a good time.
I've been working hard, I've been touring the country three times, doing 120 to 130 concerts a year.
He released two good albums.
Of course, I'm not what I was, say, 20 years ago.
Biology watches don't fool you.
Singing like I sang at my 30s is getting harder.
Still, I'm in the middle of a fight, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm on a different level.
That's where you write the new album, the first in three years.
Yeah, we're working on it now.
In fact, we've already recorded it in my studio, and now we're gonna send it to LA.
It's called "What are you so serious?" by a single song written in conjunction with Timati.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't put her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we make a video of it.
And we'll present the album in November to a series of my anniversary concerts at the Moscow "Crocus City Hall."
Chris Coleman, the cool American drummer, put his hand on your new record.
Do you think you wanted to get him into your tours?
In my view, Coleman is one of the world's most prominent drummers today.
He came to see me at the studio, and he was recording his parts.
I asked him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson.
But for a long job in Russia, they put out, to say the least, superfluous conditions.
It was about the royalties from Y35,000 to Y45,000 a month.
So I thought I'd find some decent musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found a great drummer, Max Baby.
In fact, it's better to feed your own (smile).
Sometimes I want to pick on one of them, not for anything.
For example, the guitarist Fodor Dossumov is highly quoted at the international level.
He's in Western music magazines, and he's been invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wye, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists, with another performing technique, has come."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you still can't come to the U.S.?
Are you trying to lift this ban?
I'm not doing anything right now.
There are a number of lawyers working on the matter.
As a musician, I'm really sorry I can't get to America.
I've said more than once that I'm studying there.
The more you talk to real professionals, the more useful.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years have not been given the tasks that American musicians have always met.
They wanted to make the best sound possible.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has refused me entry for ten years.
But I'll still apply for a visa every year to the British Embassy so I can go there again, and most of all, to work there.
The rest of Europe is kind to me.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a custom, but a poster, right?
Yeah, there's a good sports hall in Monte Carlo, and I've played it once.
Now we've been invited again, and as far as I know, all the concert tickets have been sold out.
To "Randew of Lima Wykule," which will start on 20th of July in Jurmal, will you go?
She invited me, and I, of course, responded.
Lyme is a great singer and a great woman who can present herself with a beautiful voice, even a whisper.
After the tours and the jubilee concerts, as far as I know, you're going to turn to the creative work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You've already got two albums with his songs on it.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done in a very different way.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of the High-Society in about the same show as he did.
Just a voice and a guitar.
There's no other arrangement.
I'll be accommodating our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I'm gonna try to get Alexander Jacovljewicz Rosenbaum on the album.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see what happens.
You and Boris Greubenshaw's songs have been gradually introduced into your repertoire.
Why don't you write down his stuff album later?
Boris Borisovich is a fine man and an excellent musician.
I ran into him a number of times, and I asked, "Can I sing one of his songs?
He said, "Grigory, I write songs to be played."
Please try, sing.
I think it's interesting to write a record like this.
So far, I don't have a task like this, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn't mind, I might be doing a project like this.
If you don't focus entirely on your own production center.
I presume, before you realize his potential, you don't sign contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I'd like to have under my wing, but they're separate, people.
You mean Sergey Lazarus?
Serezha is a brilliant singer, and I invited him.
I may not agree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center, there's Alexander Panayotov, who I led in "The Voice."
We made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It would be a real pity if he didn't get to the heights he deserved.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, I'm filming.
I hope it's a good result.
I'm also trying to promote other artists in my center: buying them songs, crying to poets, sometimes their tracks in the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they don't get high, I'm still going to bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On their way out, they'll get a record album, a few clips.
And then, if they want to, they can go their way, and I won't insist that they return their money.
Although I'd like one of them to make a commercial success and pay me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if it doesn't, I'm not gonna shut down the oxygen.
Let everyone work, get in, prove, like I used to prove.
If you're offered a tour of Ukraine tomorrow and you're guaranteed entry, will you go?
I'm still being invited.
This is mainly a closed exercise.
And as for the big tour...
I was a man of my country, a Russian, and I was convinced to fly to Syria on the same plane that went down.
If they say tomorrow they need to fly to some other place in the public interest, I will.
And I don't care what the bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret the situation with Ukraine.
Because I think we're the same people and we have to be together.
I'm sorry it's not gonna work, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40 to 50 concerts in Ukraine in a year.
We met like nowhere.
A very grateful public.
And with a number of Ukrainian artists, Ani Lorak, Light Loboda, Artem Loick...
There are a lot of talented people in Ukraine, and it's a real pity that they can't put their talents into a wider Russian audience right now.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I'd love to invite a classy Ukrainian performer to Russia, like Slava Wakarchuk, and to do a concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at this point...
Andrei Opacova was moved from the cosmodrome.
The technical director of the East Andrei Opacov Space and Science Centre (SSC) began work at the State Space Science and Production Centre (SSC) of Chrunichiv.
In the past, he was de facto involved in the construction of the East Space Station, but due to disagreements with the management of the Centre for the Operation of Ground- and Space-based Infrastructure (CENCI), he was transferred to a company in the Moscow Fields to coordinate the production.
Mr. Opackov will not have a changer: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished, and the function will be placed in the units of the Centre.
That the Technical Director of the East and the Deputy Director of the Centre for Technology Development, Andrei Opackov, had moved to work at the Hrunichiv GNCP, “OK” was told by the top managers of a number of space-based industries, as well as by an employee of the Government.
"He's been working on a new post for weeks," he said to the industry.
It was not possible to receive an operational comment from the Centre on Thursday, and Mr. Opskov himself was not available for comment.
However, the "OJ" information has been officially confirmed by HCPCP.
He decided to take over the position of Director of the Coordination of Production, he said at the company. Andrey Opskov has fully completed his task of providing a minimum launch for the first launch on the East Space Station.
Mr. Opskov moved to work at CENCI in 2013 with his support in the space forces, in particular in Bykonur, and in Plesetsk, on the “north” launch site, was the first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Opskov became a criminal figure.
The investigation accused him of bribing: allegedly from his application, regional businessmen received for the rebates of the State order, but failed to meet the commitments made to clean up the separate parts of the launchers in the Archangel oblast and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him not guilty.
Its technological development responsibilities in the CENCI extended to a number of projects, but the main one was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
The Federal Space Agency, then head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ospenko, in an interview with the U.S.A., explicitly said that the state of affairs in the East "was critical as early as October 2013.
The fact is that there was a strategic error in planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launcher was planned for the same time, at the end of 2015.
In order to complete the launch by the end of the year, the completion of the project was decided six months earlier and was rescheduled from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, it was a trick, with the specialists of the Centre starting to install the technology in a parallel way on uninstalled facilities.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Opskov.
Despite the risks and the transport that took place (instead of December 2015 the Soyuz only left on April 28, 2016), this idea was justified, says the source of the "O" in the cosmodrome, "or we would still not have made any launches from the East, but would have been doing construction."
The vice-premier, Dmitry Rogozine, in charge of the creation of the cosmodrome, in a joke called Andrei Opackov his "space susan", but he's the one who almost always asked for information on the progress of the construction.
Mr. Opskov remembers, and he's right, for example, in an interview with OS, he suggested that the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Specstre) should be depriving itself of the status of the sole East performer, and that we should work directly with the sub-contractors, "why do we have to put all the eggs in a single basket of Specture?"
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, the Centre has assumed the responsibilities of a general contractor to complete the construction and construction work at the start-up and technical complex by the planned launches in the fourth quarter.
According to OS, the reason for Mr. Opackov's move to a new place of work was a disagreement with the management of CENCI on how to complete the construction of the spacedrome and how to work with sub-contracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be the best for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the East.
The government official, in turn, calls the decision a strange one: "He was one of the best professionals, it would be hard to find an equivalent replacement for him."
According to OS, this will not be necessary: the post of the technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished and its functions will be distributed to the units of the Centre.
A two-professional programme will be introduced in music schools
In the future, children ' s music schools will be able to receive two courses at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture of Saintoslav Bluenko, for this purpose it is possible to re-read the repetitive disciplines of the students, and the question of the payment of the rest of the classes in the second profession can be resolved by means of special grants to RIA News.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will enable two occupations to take place, but will at the same time not be in conflict with the existing educational legislation,” said Bluenko.
Last Friday, during the “Non-Childly Talk” by Vladimir Putin with the children of the Sirius Children's Center, a student, Maria Andreyeva, stated that she was forced to pay for the repetitive items in the second profession in the CMS at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me that she was in violin and piano class, and that she was awarded competitions on both fronts.
The Head of State recognized the issue as very relevant and pledged to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian was detained on the wall.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian, Kirill N., who climbed the wall on the top of a high-rise building, reports the Al Universal Portal.
The incident took place in the capital city of Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, climbed a three-metre fence into the Nestle office building complex and himself climbed one of his towers.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance or rope.
Got a young man on the roof.
Members of the Ministry of Public Security landed him on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Migration Institute.
They find out if the young man is lawfully present in the country.
In the meantime, the video of a young man climbing to the highlands has become popular on the Internet.
Users called the boy a Spider-Man.
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy and chocolate can help lighten the VOC.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent studies suggest the opposite: a diet rich in meat squirrels and dairy products can help to alleviate the symptoms of inflammable intestinal diseases.
It is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, leading to colicing and excrement, chronic or bloody diarrhea, loss of weight, and extreme fatigue.
Normally, to alleviate the symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy, but researchers at Washington University have found that the main amino acid of triptophan protein contributes to the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the intestines in the intestines are making sure that the harmful germs that come with food do not penetrate the body.
Cells that can start an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance by protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is overstated in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammable intestinal diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacterium in their intestines have an increasing cell tolerance.
And this bacteria needs a triptophan, one of the building elements of a squirrel, to start the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a link between one type of bacteria, the Lactobacillas reuteri, which is part of the normal intestinal microbiomy, and the evolution of the cell population that increases tolerance.
The more the triptophane was in the mice's diet, the more these immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same would work for people: a combination of L. reuteri and a rich triptophan diet can contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation in the intestines.
Postdock, Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganwas, in a study of a type of tolerance-enhancing immunocells, found that one group of test mice had these cells, and the other group, which belonged to the same line but was kept separate, had none.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by mice's intestinal germs, by the communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the intestine cells has been sequented, and six species of bacteria have been found in mice with immune cells but not in mice without them.
Mouses grown in a sterile environment that didn't have a good microbiomy and didn't develop this kind of immune cell have L. reuteri, and they have immunized cells.
To understand the effect of bacteria on the immune system, the researchers raised L. reuteri in a liquid environment, and then moved a small portion of the liquid, without the bacteria, to the non-deficient immune cells separated from mice.
Immune cells have become more tolerance-enhancing cells.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it was a by-product of triptophane treatment, known as indol-3-milk acid.
When the researchers doubled the number of triptophane in mice's food, the number of these cells rose by about 50 per cent, but when the triptophane level was halved, the number of cells also fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same tolerant cell as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether by-products of the L. reuteri have contributed to the development of cells in humans as in mice, but people with inflammable intestinal diseases have been found to be deficient in the genes associated with the trictopane.
She says, "Perhaps we need to step up the development of these cells, because these cells are dependent on inflammatory processes on the inside of the intestines.
High levels of triptopane, with L. reuteri, can potentially result in an expansion of their population. "
According to José Mourinho, Manchester United hired a “genia” in the form of Nemania Matich
Manchester United hired a "genia" in the name of Nemania Matich, who he considers to be José Mourinho after a semi-defense debuted in a match against "Samporia" on the evening of Wednesday.
The player, purchased for £40 million from Chelsey, began with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last pre-season game of the UEFA Super Bowl against Real Madrid on Thursday, and impressed the role of a semi-defensor, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira ran ahead when they wanted to.
However, since Matich was not part of the pre-season tour of "Chelsey" in Asia, he was seriously short of preparation for the game, and he was able to withstand just 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, required further development before the start of the prime league.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in the way he thinks -- he's thinking football," said Mourinho.
"We're gonna help him get ready sooner than later."
Like Matich, his new-players, Victor Lindeloff and Romano Luka, began the game at the Victoria Stadium, when Mourinho began to form his core by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
"I'm grateful to the club for getting three out of four," he added.
"I'll be even more happy if they get me four out of four, but they've done a lot for me."
The former leaders of the social demokrats of Lithuania are conspiring them to stay in the ruling coalition.
The former Presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, ex-Premier Algirdas Butkjavicius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former Speaker of the Sejm of the Social Democratic Party of Cheslovas Jurschenas, appealed to the same party to stay in the ruling coalition.
According to The Parliamentary Gazette, a discussion has been initiated in the Social Democratic Party on whether to stay in the ruling coalition due to the tensions with the Union of Farmers and Greens.
And here are three senior experienced comrades with an open letter to their fellow parties, which states, inter alia, that “it is understandable that the party's partners are disillusioned with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the “crusades” has created for us, though not very light, the conditions for the further realization of the social justice goals, which we have set out in the Government's programme, and for the continued political domination of the left centre over the right parties.”
In the view of the former party leaders, the debate so far has “revealed an emotionally based expression without a specific argument”.
The authors of the letter fear that their party ' s unthinkable actions can lead to political, economic and social instability in Lithuania.
The disabled Anton Mamaev was fined
Mosgorsud commuted the sentence of the disabled chariot Anton Mamaev from four and a half years ' imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
The convicted person was previously released from SIZO by a decision of the Tymirezev court.
At the same time, Mosgorsud confirmed that the accused was a criminal, as he organized the robbery and abduction of a motoraller from a former SWAT combatant.
Mosgorsud summed up Anton Mamaev ' s sentence to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
“Mamayev is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes a crime, and, accordingly, such a person must be held criminally liable,” explains the “OJ” press secretary, Mosgorsud Ulyan Solopov.
In the present case, the court took into account Mamaev ' s state of health, the facts of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
The court also applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, according to which a sentence may be imposed below the lower limit.
As for the assistant of Mamaev, Vasily Serostanov, the court has not established the circumstances that would have led to a change in the category of the severity of the sentence and a change in the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that he was dissatisfied with the Mosgorsu decision.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legal solution would be to justify, to continue to fight for justice.
His counsel, Andrei Orlov, did not rule out an appeal to the Mosgorsud Court of Cassation and the Supreme Court.
"We're gonna use all the leverage up to the European Court of Human Rights," he said, "RIA News."
Remember, 28-year-old Moscow Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a criminal figure in the fall of last year.
The disabled man claims to have bought a scooter from a friend for 160,000 roubles to sell.
However, the proprietors of the motoraller, including a former SWAT combatant, claimed that the disabled and his assistant, Vasili Serostanov, had taken property from them, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Tymirezevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasili Serostanov to three years ' imprisonment and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years ' imprisonment in a general-regime colony (art. 162, para. 2, of the Criminal Code).
After the motionless disabled person was placed in the SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Office of the Attorney-General, the Human Rights Commissioner of President Tatiana Moskalkov, was involved.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from SIZO by a decision of the same Tymirezev court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Mosgorsuda.
UNF will report to the President on the environment
The final Action Forum of the All-Russia People's Front (FON) in 2017 will focus on environmental issues, report to the “News” source in the FNL, and confirm the head of the Alexei Ansim movement.
According to him, as a result of the “Frontics” forum, it was planned to report to the President on the problems of the domestic environment, as well as to propose a strategy to address them.
The interviewees in the UNF note that the report of the Head of State will contain a “deep analyst” on the situation in all the federal districts of the country.
According to The News, the FNF final forum will be held in the fall.
The exact date of the event has not yet been set, and it is generally adapted to the President ' s schedule, who is the leader of the movement and has traditionally been present at key FNL events.
The Front held several inter-regional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts, in Rostovna-Donu, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulaan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be made at these events, we will form a system-wide proposal to address environmental problems, and we have told the “News” of the interviewer in the FNL.
The Co-Chair of the Central Staff of the Olga-Temotheev Movement, head of the State Committee on Ecology and the Environment, said that the “Frontics” would report to the Head of State on the work carried out in the context of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The outcome of the EfE Forum and the EfE Action Forum are likely to be combined.
Over the year, we've grown up with a strong team of experts in the field of environmental issues, we've seen gaps in the law, we've stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be part of the report we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the “frontics” also report on the work on priority FNL projects, she told Olga Timofeyev's News.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues, Sergei Ivanov, would also be invited to the forum.
He had previously participated in the UNF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will be history, and the most important thing we need to do today is to start up environmental mechanisms to work for years.
To keep these questions on the agenda, she added: "Olga Timothy.
The head of the regional policy lab of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), Andrei Kolyadin, said, in raising the environmental issue, the FNL is in line with the presidential agenda.
A lot of things they, as experts, offered in various fora, and these initiatives received the support of the President, he said to the news by Andrey Kolyadin.
He stressed that, to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be ruled out, which could give the regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the FNL, the regions will be able not only to address their environmental problems, but also to develop ecotourism, the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the Balashije dump (already closed) and about the coal dust in the port of the city of Nevodka (a bill to prohibit the open trans-shipment of coal in localities, one of the authors, Olga Timofeyev, has been drawn up).
Ecology experts believe that the legal basis for dealing with environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been set up, and the question is the further application of the law, as well as the position of civil society.
A clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State is needed - the head of the Charitable Foundation “Ecology for All” Leonid Bochin.
HRC member Sergey Tshiplenkov, head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace of Russia, in a conversation with the news, stressed that a responsible approach to society and business was needed to deal with environmental problems successfully, and there was little legislative effort to do so.
As soon as society and business realize that the solution to environmental problems is a much more lucrative step in a strategic perspective, the situation will change, says Sergei Chickenkov.
The expert stressed the need to reverse the trend that the violation of environmental law was a cost-effective solution for business.
The British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and the car at the swing of his hand.
The British inventor was the first man in the country to have a microchip set up to open the door to his house, to go into the office, and even to start the car with a simple swing of his hand.
The 33-year-old Stephen Northham put a tiny chip between his big and indexing fingers and now, through his company BioTek, offers this service to firms and private individuals who want to make their lives simpler with technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from the Royal in Winchester, to ensure that the infusion procedure was in line with medical standards.
Technology is like a microchip that is used by cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds.
Northham also replaces locks in homes and cars with a chip-compatible value of £300 per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House Requisition cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars.
According to the records of the armed forces given to the magazine Time, the White House's decision last month to bring a Marine Helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost the taxpayers a total of $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One", when the president is on board, has become a central feature of a White House event on 17 July, at which American construction programmes were shown.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence, and White House top officials have been looking at the tech products from all 50 states.
The helicopter in Connecticut was positioned next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a freighter from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the Division for Helicopter Management, the White House Military Department ordered the presence of the Helicopter in a private order, or “FRAGO”, just 36 hours before the Helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an “unusual” event.
“I just wanted you to know that you know, because this is an unusually well-known press event,” wrote the commander of HMX-1 in an e-mail to his head, the first deputy airmaster of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive in the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on 17 July to attend an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and would stay there until the lawn was freed between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be needed to return in accordance with the time limit.
The first crew was escorting a helicopter during the event, and the unit's security officers remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was not clear from the records received by the Time Journal whether a second crew was needed at the end of the day.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using State property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 specified whether the activity was in conflict with the order.
“We asked, among other things, if it was a violation of Hatch's law, and we were told no,” the commander wrote.
“You don't seem to have a place to go,” the Deputy Chief replied.
The event "Done in America" was declared an official event by the White House, and it was not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even formal events have political notes.
During the event, the President made an effort to advance the reform of health, which was at the time in the Senate, and lauded the attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft, known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes, is hardly new.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's unusual to ask for them alone in the interest of photography.
Trump was already the subject of a discussion in February, when the presidential plane passed in the background during his first election meeting in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was full of complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House is fascinated by the "made in America" show, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American material,” said Lyndsey Walters, the White House Press Secretary.
HMX-1 crews often fly around the Washington Agglomeration and on the South Lawn to train the President of the United States to transport to the White House to an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 carried out 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight for the "Done in the Americas" event was counted as part of a month's training.
The unit ' s rotary-wing aircraft also overflyed 11 additional hours on that day as part of the “non-presidential support tasks”.
According to the White House, the taxpayers did not spend on any of the other items presented at the event.
A representative of Sikorsky reported that the company was not part of the South Lawn Helicopter Demonstration.
HMX-1 does not account for the budget for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to Department of Defense time-rates for the fiscal year 2017, the VH-3D rate of reimbursement is US$24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records that air time in air was 30 minutes each way from its airstrip at the Quantico Marine Airbase in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than this rate.
“Telling the cost to the taxpayers on the basis of an estimated rate of reimbursement is very wrong,” says Walters.
“These indicative rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual allocation”.
According to a study carried out in 2015 by the RAND Corporation, the rates of reimbursement do not include the cost of the personnel, but do take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and the costs specified in the contract.
At the time, the former White House Spicer Spokesman spoke out to defend the use of a helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to show this week things done in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to national security, and that there are, I guess, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose job is dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of this chopper and other military equipment, which so many Americans have been working so hard on.
Therefore, of course, it is entirely appropriate to take note of this.
It was not clear if Trump interacted with a helicopter by looking at the South Lawn during the event, but he was exactly in the driver's seat in a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump approached Sikorsky for a joke with the press on the company's own fleet of products.
"I know very well "Sikorsky," the president said. "I have three."
Moscow will provide grants to the ICUs of urban hospitals
Every year, “Save Life” grants will be allocated to the intensive care units of the capital health centres.
Funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobyan, visited the Yudin City Hospital.
In the course of his examination of the clinic, he provided a thank you letter to the orthopedic doctor, Victor Procko, who led the most complex operation to reconstruct the adolescent ' s foot.
Sergei Sobyan also spoke of the decision to grant grants to the ICUs and ICUs of the city ' s clinics each year.
Funds will be allocated to the promotion of doctors and nurses.
According to the city head of the city, the Yudin Hospital is one of the largest in Moscow today.
In recent years, new modern equipment has been made available to the clinic to enable its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at the Columinian Rural Hospital.
The health-care units are now available for over a thousand patients.
In addition to the ICU and the infirmary, there are day wards.
The staff of the hospital is 2,800.
The total area of the health centre is 23.7 ha.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a member of the short-term infirmary pilot project.
They are designed to carry out relatively small operations.
In the process of intervention, advanced medical equipment has been used to significantly shorten the period of patient rehabilitation.
After an inpatient operation, they spend only a few hours.
In the first half of this year alone, 36,000 patients received in-patient care at the Juda Hospital.
The medical staff of the clinic performed 15,800 operations with varying degrees of difficulty.
NBU reported no buyers of Ukrainian Sberbank's daughter.
In the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) no bids for the purchase of the Ukrainian Sberbank.
This is reported on Friday, 4 August, by TASS, with a reference to a representative of the NBU press service.
The NBU confirms that, on 3 August 2017, a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Victor Prokopeni, for the purpose of agreeing on the indirect acquisition (through the Paris Bank) of 100 per cent of Sberbank shares has been withdrawn.
“No documents have been received from other potential investors to buy Sberbank stock in the NBU”, states the report.
On 3 August, a Belarusian businessman, Victor Prokopenya, withdrew an application for a subsidiary of Sberbank.
On 28 July, it was reported that the National Bank of Ukraine had refused Russian businessmen Said Guteriev and Gregory Guselnikov to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank.
The regulator based his decision on the failure of businessmen to provide the necessary documents to check for compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian law.
Sberbank announced the sale of his Ukrainian "girl" to Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The major shareholder of the consortium was Said Guteriav, the son of a Russian businessman, Mikhail Guteriyev.
The sanctions against the five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
In the course of the year, they are not allowed to withdraw capital from the country in favour of parent organizations.
Trailer of the third season of "Drug": The Cali Cartel is central to the popular "Netflix" show after the death of Pablo Escobar.
Despite the fact that in the second season of "Drug" the identity of Pablo Escobar's killer was discovered, the "Netflix" show was far from finished.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons are planned, and the third has already been introduced by the first trailer to show the villains of the upcoming show.
In the third season, the Agency's attention was drawn by the richest drug-dealing organization, the Cali Cartel.
The organization, led by powerful godfathers, works as a company on the Fortune 500 list, with only a large number of government bribes and acts of violence.
The leader of the Cartels is Hilberto Rodriguez Orehuela (Damian Alcasar), Miguel Rodriguez Orehuela ( Francisco Denis), her brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of relations with Mexico, and Chepe Santacrus-Londondoño (Pepe Rapasote) is working in New York.
In a newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character who brings American and Colombian law enforcement to help in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Mathias Varela, Michael Stahl David, Matt Villan, Igel Angel Sylvester, Kerry Bichet, and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Drug" will be on screen on September 1.
Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, said the United Nations.
The elections can be representative only when all members of society, including women, are involved, and on Wednesday the head of the United Nations mission to Afghanistan has stated.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for vice-presidentship, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
The choice can be fully representative only when women are fully involved and included in all stages of the electoral process.
The provincial council and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban threaten to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year's election, power is for the first time moving in a peaceful way from one democratically elected Government to another.
Heisom said that the promotion of the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The Attorney-General confirmed the indictment in the case of Nikita the White
The Russian Attorney General confirmed the indictment in a criminal case against the former Governor of Kirov oblast, Nikita White, who was accused of receiving a major bribe.
This was reported on Thursday, 3 August, by the agency, to the RIA News.
The material has been submitted to the Presensky District Court of Moscow for consideration on the merits.
In Venice, the fines for tourists for improper conduct have been tightened
The Venetian authorities have tightened the canals' fines from Euro50 to Euro500.
Walking around the city in a bathing suit or with a head bare will now be fined 200 Euros.
For 100 Euros, those who make a public picnic or ride a bicycle in the walking areas will be required to pass the TASS with a reference to the Russian Association of Tour Operators.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide a fine for the inscriptions on the monuments of 400 Euros and for the trash of 25 Euros.
To inform tourists of the need to observe the rules of conduct in Venice, a special company, "EnjoyRespectVenezia" (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) will be used to inform them of the need to observe the rules of conduct in the city's website, on billboards, and in the most crowded tourists.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the Tourism Adviser of Venice, Paula Mar, the fines will be sent to home country embassies to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she remarked.
In April, the Italian city announced plans to limit the flow.
In Venice, the number of visitors to the city centre has already been successfully restricted.
Instead of the 100,000 people who wanted to watch the Festival del Redentore festival, only 60,000 people were admitted to the site.
In addition, a moratorium has been put in place on the creation of new fast-food hotels and restaurants in the historical part of Venice.

FS dismissed Lake from head of the committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday supported the statement of the Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, Victor Lakeov, and dismissed him from his post.
He's still a senator from Khabarovsk province.
An application for his release from the lakes last week.
He explained his decision to rotate and to change the rhythm of life.
The Senator also noted that the decision to leave was not a short-term one.
Victor Lakeov has been a member of the Parliament of the Khabarovsk Region in the FF since 1996.
The Senate has been in charge of the Defence and Security Committee since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for both the inhabitants and the producers of the storm.
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electric energy users have been beginning to bear fruit for more than a decade.
Since 1 September, the cost of low-tension electricity for industrial recipients has fallen by 25 per cent.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country, in accordance with the Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation “On the introduction of changes to the Regulation on the Optical Market for Electric Power and to the combined prognosis of the production and supply of electric energy (power) within the framework of the Russian unified energy system for the constituents of the Russian Federation” (No. 842), has set the indicative prices of electricity and power to the industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electric energy for drilling manufacturers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have overwhelmed the thresholds of the Moscow cabinets in a futile attempt to level the region with the next Irkuta region with a cascade of hydroelectric power plants in Angara, which stems from the Baikala, for which Buryatia is the main catchment area.
And it was only this year that the changes began.
In March, the rate for electricity for the population of the Republic was reduced from 4.24 roubles/kWh to 3.93 roubles/kWh, or 7.3%.
With the inclusion of the Bourging by the Federal Government in the list of bulk-market-price-zones for which the characteristics of the operation of the bulk and retail markets have been determined, the turn of industrial consumers has come.
Analysts believe this is just the beginning, as the population in Irkutsk Region pays for a kilowatt/hour of 1.01 roubles.
But no one dares to give at least an approximation date for new tariff shifts down for Buritia.
Scooter didn't fear the Office of the Attorney General of Ukraine and flew to Crimea
The legend of electronic dance music, Scotter, came to Crimea without fear of threats from the Office of the Procurator-General of Ukraine.
"The flight went well, and I'm gonna have a concert tomorrow," quotes the RIA "News" by the frontman of H.P. Baxter.
Previously, the German edition of Bild, with reference to Ukraine ' s Deputy Attorney General, Yenin Yenin, reported that for a visit to Crimea, which is considered to be a temporary occupied territory in Kyiv, musicians may face up to eight years ' imprisonment.
Scotter's performance at a festival in Balaclave, called #ZBFest, is scheduled to take place on August 4.
#ZBFest is hosted by the Golden Balk to mark International Champagne Day.

Ace's last album was released in 2016.
In addition to Scooter, the festival will be attended by Sergei Galanin and his band Serga, as well as Garik Sukachev with the Brigada C.

The National Union of unskilled, municipal and cottage workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment in the McVitee's in Glasgow Factory.
The trade union requires guarantees from the manager of the biscuit producer McVitie's in connection with his long-term obligation to produce at the Glasgow plant.
The Scotland office of GMB states that the company has been silent on the issue of future investment at the Chicago site.
The plant, which produces, among other things, Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, reports that over five million pounds have been invested in the facility in the last few years.
The company adds that, in the event of any change in the work of the site, the employees and trade union representatives “are the first to know about them”.
In a letter to the company's head of the facility, the Scottish GMB office required McVite's response to the concern that funding would not be used to upgrade production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy stated: “The members of our trade union are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the business manager-general and investment plan for the future of Tolcross.
Families have been working here for generations, and the concentration of workers is high in local society and in the territory of the Greater Glasgow; this is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, in terms of jobs, wages, and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, the growth of the subsistence minimum and the chronic decline in production, the East End Glasgow is desperately in need of a flourishing production in the McVitie's factory.
According to a representative of Pladis, “the head of the Transversian site just yesterday received a letter from the Scottish office of GMB, and the company will respond immediately, as we value our constant cooperation with the employees and trade union representatives.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolkrossa with GMB staff and representatives, at which a number of issues were openly discussed.
We talked to the staff about how, like all companies working in the most competitive and fragile economic environment, we are constantly re-evaluating our actions – and this is the case for all of our facilities and activities – to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our interpretative object, especially in production lines and improved performance.”
We are fully cognizant of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and in the event of any change in the work at this site, the staff and trade union representatives will be the first to know.
Putin said that the authorities would not give orders to Rosneft and Gazprom.
Wladimir Putin stated that the issue of gas supply to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNAC) should involve the Kremlin and the Cabinet, but that no one would give instructions to Gazprom, like Rosnefti.
So Russia’s President, Wladimir Putin, responded to Igor Sechin’s request to help resolve the contradictions.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that the relationship between Rosneft and Gazprom should be based solely on market-based principles.
Previously, the head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of a gas agreement with Gazprom for VNHC jeopardized the project's duration.
Sekin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on the subject was ongoing.
Gazprom is proposing to find gas from Rosnefty's perimeter, but we don't have such resources," he added.
Recall that Rosneft has asked for permission to use gas from the Kirin Gazprom field on the Sahalin shelves for the East Petrochemical Company.
In June, Gazprom stated that the negotiations on the issue were still under way, and there were no “speaks”.
Did SVU warn Barcelona about Naimar's transition three years ago?
A member of the La League may regret his interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris St. Germaine will not stop following Naymar after the club has offered £189 million for his ransom, but have they warned Barcelona about the world record of the attack three years ago?
The sensational proposal revived the summer transfer window, when League 1 was ready to break the world record at the cost of the transition, more than double the previous mark for the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transition is over, Naymar will become the world's most expensive player, as well as the world's highest-paying professional sportsman, as SGW offers him a wage of more than £500,000 a week clean.
It is well known that Barcelona has been furious about the way in which the proposal was put forward, and how Neimar broke off the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the Catalan Club, the club has always been doing its best for the player since he moved out of Santos in 2013.
But was not the football world warned of such an opportunity three years ago by the President of SVU?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in the recruitment of Blaise Mathuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a strong warning to any club that would like to lure one of the best players in SVU.
“I'm not worried, because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we're going to stand up to them, we're going to propose to their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they'll have consequences.
It appears that Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed an interest in Marco Verratty's SVU parafector.
SVU has made it clear that it will not release the Italian player on any condition, and now it is likely that Barcelona is experiencing the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neimar.
Poetin's been assigned to take care of the payments made to the forest fire victims.
Russia’s President, Wladimir Poetin, has instructed us to look into the material assistance that is being given to the forest fire victims and to the construction of new housing.
Today, I would like to hear how the work is going.
In particular, please report on the status of the payments made to the affected citizens.
I've got a bit of a misunderstanding.
“In this regard, I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues questions about how much money has been allocated,” said Putin at a meeting with the leaders of the Baykal regions.
On August 4, Wladimir Poetin visited the Baikal State Natural Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by a full-time representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District, Sergey Méjlo, and the head of the FGBU branch office, Glovebud, Leonid Mikhaylik.
They talked about the work on cleaning the lake.
The boys were then shown in an open container next to the container, which was prepared for breeding.
First, Putin let a few kids out of the sack.
And then he pulled a special lever on the top of the container and let the others out.
Also during the visit, the leader ordered an environmental response to Baykale and to build a road on Olhon Island.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, one volume is needed, and another volume is required.
"I want to figure out what's going on with the funding, in fact," stressed the Russian leader.
Recall, during the forest fires of 2017, the towns of Buritia, Irkutsk oblast, were hit with fire, and homes and constructions were destroyed.
In Ukraine, a Russian was offered to go to prison for illegal border crossing
A bill has been registered in the Supreme Council of Ukraine, according to which Russians may be subject to criminal penalties for illegal crossing of the Ukrainian border.
According to RT, the document in the Ukrainian Parliament's electronic database presupposes a three-year prison sentence for Russian citizens who try to enter the country illegally.
It is noted that for a reoffending offence or an act committed by a group of persons, the sentence may be extended to five years.
If the intruder was held at the border with the gun, the time of his detention would be eight years.
It has been previously reported that Ukrainian border guards have detained Ukrainians who have tried to enter Russia outside the designated border crossing points.
"Magnet" went out in the open.
The second food retailer, Magnet, announced the opening of three test shops in a new format, Magnet Opt, which are designed to buy small bulk.
At the same time, the option of purchasing the goods in a separate way is maintained, as stated in the company ' s press release.
The shops in the new format have been made in Krasnodar, Saratov and Ulyanovsk.
Their range is about 1,500 items of food and non-food items.
“The new service will enable companies and businessmen to make purchases with financial gain, and the people to buy supplies for a week or a month,” they believe in Magnet.
In the small-scale segment, Metro Cash & Carry and Selgros Cash & Carry are already in operation.
In 2017, Lenta launched a special program, Lenta Pro, which invited legal entities and private entrepreneurs to buy on special funds for hypermarkets, to receive invoices to account for costs and to return VAT.
The project is focused on the HoReC segment, small differences, and offices.
There will be two new territories in Russia that are ahead of economic and social development, Abosa and Novotrowitzk.
The relevant decisions of the Government of the Russian Federation will enter into force today, 4 August.
The boundaries and economic activities of the Torra have been defined in the territory of the city of Abaz in the Republic of Haqasiyah.
In a city of 15,000 people, there will be a special legal regime for entrepreneurship, as well as a minimum capital investment of residents, and a minimum number of new permanent jobs.
This is expected to attract about 2.5 billion roubles of investment into the city, and more than 600 new jobs will be created.
The list of economic activities in which ABAZ has a special legal regime for business, such as crop production, livestock, food production, non-alcoholic beverages and clothing.
Already, the Government of the Republic has signed framework agreements for the implementation of eight investment projects.
It is also planned to reduce the Territory's dependence on the Abakan Mining Company.
In January 2017, the authorities in the region reported that Hakasia had met all the conditions of the Mino-Economy for the creation of the TOR.
The Orenburg State has also done the same.
There, the city of Novotrovitz will also have an area of pre-eminent economic and social development.
This will enable the mono-urban economy to be diversified, less dependent on the U.S. company, U.S. Steel, and more than 2,300 jobs and more than 8 million roubles of investment.
The list of economic activities in which the new TOR will have a special legal regime for businessmen includes, inter alia, freshwater fish, fodder, medicinal and medical materials.
Novotrowitzk was the first monocities in Orenburg oblast to become TOR.
Let us recall that the pre-development area is an economic zone with tax-free conditions, simplified administrative procedures and other privileges, which is created to attract investment in the improvement of the life of the population.
The following are among the benefits for the residents: a profit tax of no more than 5 per cent for the first five years, and at least 10 per cent for the next five years, a social contribution of 7.6 per cent for 10 years, a free-customs regime, a preferential regime for connection to various infrastructure facilities, as well as favourable rents.
The vine called Manson "screw" and threatened to "screw the face."
Yury Loza expressed his resentment at the American rock musician, Marilyn Manson, who offended Moscow.
In an interview with "Comsomol Truth," the Russian singer called Manson "unsatisfied" and "rebellious."
According to Loza, foreign artists who make such statements do not need to be invited to Russia.
Also, Loza thinks Manson has to be punched in the face for what he said.
To recall, the American artist, who was known for his erotic actions, spoke rudely about the Russian capital at a concert in Kyiv.
Previously on Thursday, "Arguments of the week" wrote that Manson's statement was commented on by a national producer, Joseph Prigozhin.
In Moscow, a policeman shot a man in the leg, shielding himself from the attack.
