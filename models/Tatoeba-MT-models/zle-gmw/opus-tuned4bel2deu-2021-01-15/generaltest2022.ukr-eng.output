Good day, I'm so sorry, I didn't have a small Internet, and I couldn't send it any faster.
Can you please tell me the exact address to go to the cleaning tomorrow, what's the code for the key, and what's the time tomorrow, the guests go out, and the new guests move?
I'm sorry, I have to give up your offer, because I really have found a job in this time.
I'm sorry, but I can't say no.
I sometimes think that, through a translator, my thoughts in the Czech language differ from what I write in the Ukrainian language.
We promised you a surprise when you went to school.
Good day, I'm taking the course.
But please tell me if there is a time earlier.
Because I don't live in Prague, it can be a problem with transport.
If there are no options, I'll still agree.
Thank you well in advance.
In Herson, the people went out again, the Russians didn't get a chance to break up
According to the West Watch, the Hersonians had been able to hold a meeting before the military FF and technology arrived at the site.
"We've been able to hold a meeting, and now there's a flu tech," said one of the Westers.
In the past, the townsmen have traditionally been gathered to protest on the Square of Liberty, near the ODA building and the city hall.
The area is now controlled, as is the building, by the armed Russian forces, which use weapons against protesters and steal people.
On April 3, armed Russian occupiers reportedly used weapons against peaceful protesters in Cahovca.
According to Ucrynform, people in Doneca regularly wage peaceful protests against a Russian agressor.
Russian military forces use force and weapons against humans, are wounded and detained.
Russian invaders also steal the inhabitants of the region.
President Volodymyr of the Greene won Herson the special title "The City of the Hero."
On February 24, the President of the FF Road began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The Russian forces are firing and destroying the key infrastructure, carrying out massive shellings of the residential areas of the Ukrainen towns and villages, using artillery, fire-fire jets, and ballist rockets.

Hey, I'm sick, so it's better to take this meeting to the next weekend, I'm sorry.
I know how to cook, the main thing to do is to make a recipe, but I like to bake.
In Ukraine, borsche, cookies, and others are common.
I don't have any favorite dishes, I like to go through a wide range of foods from country to country.
What do you like about food, you like to cook?
I want to be busy.
There's a train, and there's no place.
Sorry, we're a little late.
Lucia, can I go to the kitchen as a helper?
It's a good thing Julia's gonna be able to go to work.

If Nazar works at 5:30, he can use any train:
Green: Mariopole - the heart of war, stop fighting - we will have weak positions
President Volodymir of Zelenski believes that the fight for the East of Ukraine, and in particular for Mariopole, will determine the course of the war – and if the USB is defeated there, the Russians can give up their negotiations and re-emerge the de-occupied areas.
The direct language is, "Mariopole is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It's battling, we're fighting, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have a weaker position.
They (the city's protectors, Red.) are people who have drawn on a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariopole, the stronger our position will be in the East, in the (area) OSV, and if they are stronger, the table of victory will be closer to us, and we will have the advantage of a dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all of this, we may not be able to wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to the cities we've been depriving us of.
They can go for this too.
Then our win-win situation will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting to the Russian side.
Sadly, we do.
We believe in our result, in our victory... "
Details: Greenski also said that it was hard to go to the talks after the torture of the Ukrainians, but "we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if we have one."
The real language is, "People will see peace in any case, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something – and I don't think any peace will please them on any condition.
But if we don't talk emotionally, the war has to end in peace, or it's gonna end in millions of casualties.
And even where there are a million casualties, all come to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight – but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for the dust when there's nothing, there's no man."
Good day, do you have any more space for a Czech class for adults from 7:00 a.m. Tuesday?

I'll text you when the place is ready for the guests.
Dominique, who buys the material?
This is a constant procedure, do you have to order it as far as it's done?
In view of the change in the aesthesia of Ukrainian literature, new concepts are needed to describe its new quality state.
In fact, it's an analysis of the metaphoric space of Ukrainian literature, a state-of-the-art study.
The Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows for a postmodern context to be analyzed as such, where the metaphor is an acsiological criterion

Code is needed for the food
The Department of Defence of Ukraine's main intelligence agency has published a list of Russian military officials who have been involved in the commission of war crimes in the city of Bucha of Kyiv.
According to Ucrynform, this is reported by the Department of Defence of Ukraine in Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian has to know their names!
The MoU of Ukraine has obtained a list of 64 individual combat crews who are directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Butch,” is in the report.
The MOU GUR states that for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and held accountable.
You can view the list by reference.
According to Ucrynform, Irpin, Bucha, Hotel, and the entire region of Kyiv were freed from Russian invaders.
In the freed towns and villages, there are mass killings by Russian military civilians.
On April 1, the city head of Butchi, Anatoly Fedorouk, reported that 280 people had been buried in mass graves.
The Attorney-General of Irina Venedictov stated that 410 bodies of dead civilians had been removed from the Russian invaders in the Kyiv Region on April 3.
On February 24, Russia’s president, the ruler of the road, announced the start of a full - scale invading Ukraine.
The Russian invaders are firing and destroying key infrastructure, carrying out massive shellings of residential areas in Ukraine's cities and villages, using artillery, fire-fire jets, ballist rockets, air bombardments.
Good day, I'm sorry, but I can't work for you, 'cause I'm gonna fly to Canada for the next time.
Right behind the dash, there are formal names, and at risk, there are lazy expressions, in the strings, the shortcuts, which are used for hours.
I don't want to disturb you. Rest.
I've been looking at the prediction of the weather.
I don't need brandy.
It's just a nice dress at normal prices and size.
We were at the shop at the train station.
The professions that offer. Can be unfamiliar?
It's important, if there's a tradition, I need to know what I'm gonna do.
I was thinking in a week, but we're getting hot in here, okay?
Tomorrow might be a bad connection on the way.
I thank every man for his experience, even if he's a pain.
I think I've learned from every situation for myself so I don't want to make any more mistakes.
The directives are in the form of numbered written supplements, which are part of this Regulation.
I'm sure it won't be a problem.
In Ukraine, a lot of people are also celebrating this week.
It depends on the belief.
Whether a man is a Greek-Catholic or a Catholic.
at the start, you can try it free of charge.
Maybe you can write us an algorym to pay for it, we can pay for it.
We have the paper the kids get at the end of the school year, this is a table, and the witness is given at the birth and the wedding.
He's on it as an experienced driver, but I don't know if it's any better.

I'll try to catch up, 'cause I'm still in the city hall to sign the papers.
Wife is not mad you're on the phone
In my daily prayers, I thank God and God for you.
Let them cover you with their cover of love and warmth this night.
My heart belongs to you.
Do you mind if I come right after the war?
a place, a day, and a time will be specified according to the interests and opportunities
We promised you a surprise when you went to school.
Bolob is great, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouca the area is irrelevant, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply appalled by the news of the brutal abuse of the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photographs of people who have been shot and shot have perplexed the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other, how could this have happened in the 21st century?
And I'm not surprised at all, and it's just what I've been waiting for.
I got the kids and the old parents from Kyiv on the second day of the war.
And then the girl coworkers with the kids, and then he went back to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have been helping the USB in a series of ways, and I have no doubt that, in the case of the occupation, my family will not be spared.
Because he was, and I'm absolutely sure, that the essence of the rotting Communo-CDBist regime has been constant since 1918.
Without terror, it just can't exist, it's built on a terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in Gitomir.
A few years ago, the U.S.S.S.A. was given a copy of the arraignment case: the whole thing is over a hundred pages, and the death sentence is very simple, and it's even more frightening.
The accused was unlettered, denied the charge.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was a free man, a poor "one-street," never went to the fortresses.
The fact of living on the courtyards and having a number of cows was enough to disqualify a farmer and a breadwinner of young children to be put to death.
The family didn't even know the place to be buried.
My grandmother said that almost a hundred people had been taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
There's the name of the scissor.
Our former Speaker of the Supreme Council is from a nearby village.
I believe in genetics, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGB informer.
The apple from the apple is not far from falling, as we know...
The shooter who ordered the villagers to be killed was the ethnic Russians.
In analyzing the case of the great-grandfather, he was interested in a variety of informational resources.
There are excellent (no sarcasm) information resources in Russia, like "The Infinite Baracke," which are reminiscent of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NCV-Dists have found ways to punish and kill almost everyone who has been seriously investigating the crimes of their ancestors 70 to 80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves of the victims of the Stalinist repression and publicly wrote the names of the murderers — the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It's like a computer found files of child pornography, put in a prison for it, and it's gone fast.
The KGB is still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly amazed at their actions now?!
There are the most repugnant traits of human nature.
Over the millennia of Ordinary tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism began in the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then a wild genetic experiment was done on what came out, cutting the brains out during a few waves of red terror.
Look at the semi-French movie "Cheqist" of 1992, so it was.
Zo you've seen my picture in my bathing suit
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from a cough?
I'm sorry, I don't have anyone to ask.
I also wanted to ask you maybe you know where the kids went, 'cause Galia can't know them.
Sweetheart, Igor asks if it's okay for you to go tomorrow. (It's free and can go because the car hasn't been seen at the station yet.)
We're very uncomfortable with you so much to worry about.
You're very helpful, thank you!
* In the berothian near Kyiv, the bodies of seven civilians have been found in two multi-surface homes in the process of clearing the rubble.
* Mariopole’s backers claimed that an unknown poisonous substance from a Russian unmanned man was spilled over the city.
Three people have been killed.
¤ Some 1,700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians are held in Russian jails.
Of these, 500 are women.
Germany will allocate 1 million euro to support the International Criminal Court, which is investigating the war crimes of the Russian army in Ukraine.
Canada has implemented sanctions for 33 enterprises in the Russian defence sector.
* In the past days, one enemy tank, three armoured personnel carriers, three artillery systems, 24 units of car technology, one helipopter, and three unmanned men have been destroyed in the battles in the east of Ukraine.

I've got my first Cycle after my son.
When girls come back from school, what do they do?
We've come to the place where we've been put down from the center in the parish, the conditions are good.
But there's a big one, but there's a man here who drinks and smokes in a room, sound music is the very least that's "concerned," the smell of cigarettes by drunken men, and me and the kids... it's scary to go to bed, to be fair.
Please help with the house, for the money, please.
But where it's safe and not stoned.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is like this, and it's like they're smoking right here.
I beg you very much, one of them is barely standing on his feet, something yelling, something he won't like.

Last night, things went very well.
We've been talking about kids with special needs you and the system of teaching them in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shahova introduced me as a Fpoint worker, the first question was how the dog was found, how the mop was found.
Everyone's watching the Facebook page.
They asked me to give you a welcome and tell you what's very interesting for them to read the news.
We also talked about people of Roman nationality who have the privileges in Ukraine.
And we made a deal that if the kid came in and the parents didn't even understand the Czech at all, then after work, I could help them in the phone mode.
I need to change bedwear, two sets.
That's what I'm doing on holiday days.

Everyone has a chance.
The main thing is that love is real and mutual.
I don't know how to do it in Europe, but in our country, people get married for a variety of reasons, most of the time, it's a mercantial goal.
And I have a problem with that if I don't love a man doesn't work out.
Yeah, we took my aunts home right away.
She was very grateful, she was crying.
I told her about you and how you help the Ukrainians.
The tears were in her eyes.
Said if it was possible, there might still be some old blanket and a pillow.
But it doesn't have to be, just if it is.
I was sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I had a lot of questions about God, why my life was going on, and I was just made to distrust everything.
I need to buy bread and other things.
I just decided to go and you made the meetings.
That's right, but we don't even know where it is, and we don't know where it is. We've been looking for an hour today and we've been back on foot.
Even now, I was thinking about you, and you texted me.
Does your dad know how to speak Russian or any other family?
You can get the kids to go to Wally and play holy.
All right, let's take a chance:)
I'm glad I met you, too.
The house was talking to Volodymyr about whether to check me out while they find or look for themselves told the lady here who lives with us that we need to go to the metro station of a museum there is an institution that helps us find a place
For a small one, I'm going to cross the barrier.

So would be good for Thursday if possible
I can't call the doctor 'cause I haven't done a food license test yet.
But I can't call him, 'cause I ran out of money.
I can't fill out the phone 'cause I don't understand the Czech online banking, and I don't get the U.K. bank card.
In addition to the water phone, I can't change the rate so I have normal phone calls and the Internet don't fill out the number.

I'll text you anyway.
Hey. Concerned to help. I've come to pay for March. It's just us and Julia, or just me, I can't figure out why this sum is.

I'm having fun with you, and I like it.
Called to the caritas, there was an offer of temporary accommodation for a week - two, but I need a permanent place where I can be with the kid, and why there's less and less left.
The blossoms are polished. It's okay. Everybody's resting and very good.
According to "European Truth", this is what Welt writes with a reference to the sources in the U.K. government circles.
According to the publication, an appropriate offer was sent to the Department of Economics of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 goubits, including a teaching kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euro.
As is also proposed in the 1.2 billion euro version of the Boxer APC.
While tanks in combat have to come relatively close to the targets of the adversary, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can drive fire more than 30 km away.
The U.S. government circles with a link to KMW's offer report that the supply of self-sustainable goubles is going to go round.
The Bundesvere, in the shortest term, will give Kyiv 100 of its hubites, and the spaces that have been created will then be filled with the industry at the second stage.
The first new Hawaiians can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed by 2027.
Is this us in the first half of the day, or in the second half of the day together?
Thank you.

Thank you. I'm working on it. We've been talking about it in the Czech classes on Wednesday.
For the last four years, I've been out of touch, I've been reading a lot of books in philosophy, and I've been looking at myself.
It's hard to trust you when it's very painful.
But you have to try again, everyone goes through something that changes it forever, it's life.
Martin, we're going to bed.
Thank you for such a good and fun day.
We really loved it.
We feel like we're in our family.
The kids all night told their dad, all their grandparents, how good it was for you.
We're the best wishes for the festival.
And now we've been watching.
I hope the son will come out alive from this meat cut.
Let's go today, maybe something will be needed.
How do you get in touch with them to open the door?
Is there any improvement in overcoming the coronavirus?
Thank you very much for helping people.
We're in Slape right now, we've been backed up by friends for a while.
My family is a man, a 6-year-old daughter, a 11-year-old son.
The man has already found a driver’s job.
I'm a masseuse, a rehabist looking for a job.
For the kids to go to school, and for me to work, we need a place to live close to civilization.
I just needed to give it to the country today!
I didn't know even the big shops would be closed.
I make the doves like this: in a pot of tomato paste, I make a tomato of 0.5 liters of water of 3-4 canteens of tomato paste, it's going to make it boil.
I'm putting the doves in a pot and pouring this sauce.
I've been carving in the oven for about 1.5 hours.
How much do I have on this room?
I have to bring all of this.
From Monday four.
4. In 2022, refugees from the war in Ukraine can ask for humanitarian assistance at the new place of work of the Labour Administration in the Pryce Market.
The branch office in Hall No. 29 is dedicated to providing and processing requests for help, so there is a translator in the field.
Lidia's been sent to school, but we're going to go to school on Tuesday. I told you today.
I sit down, I hold headphones on my ear, I listen to music, and I think about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, love, how are you?
I know you're having a hard time.
But I think we're together, that we're a couple.
I'd say there's gonna be a lot of work after the war.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I know a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into one of them.
I just don't know what's gonna happen to the house.
I need to get a food license test, can I do it in you?
Please tell me, tomorrow for five guests to get the apartment ready.
Is this the fifth place I understand in a room with a TV?
Planting and fixing the sofa?
Can we stay at your place until Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to live?
Don't worry about it.
Not the new one that's been used, but it's a workman, but it's not needed.
Write the address in Czech, let's see the map where it's from us.
I don't know how much free space there is so I can't plan with the furniture want this week to finally look at that apartment and then figure out which furniture I need
I'm sorry I've been answering for so long, it's been a day, it's hard to adapt.
Is that enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, to have this opportunity to hug you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how you feel.
For the kid, there's already a bed and a bath, something for the first time I've found
Don't forget that you promised to help me as soon as you can, but don't give me the last one.
I want to make a haircut that's called a hat.
Oleg's sick, diet and cough.
I'll just be a little bit later - about eight, okay?
I don't want any misunderstandings with you.
'Cause I'm worried it's gonna be okay!?
'Cause we didn't even talk about it with these excerpts!
I know how important this is to you!
I'm not talking about myself.
How are you feeling today?
Hey, I'm sorry, I just woke up, didn't sleep well.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
I was saddened that we had a bad start on the test last night.
I'm going to ask if Gregory Denissenka or Jonaszek) to help me at least a little bit with the math.
Maybe there's something I can do for them, too.
If this is possible, I want to pick up the math in the weekend.
Geometry is actually hard, but we have to work with the wheel so that we can make no mistakes.
Thank you for the Test Jobs
We're very much looking forward to that, too.
Well, she's very happy about any gift.
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number
Last night, at 402 bus stops, I met a girl in Ukraine, Victoria.
This girl is a kid, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay out of it.
Now we agreed to be friends.
And last night, I thank God for this girl, for this is the first man in Ukraine to have a heart-to-heart relationship.
The branch office in Hall No. 29 is dedicated to the provision and processing of requests for help
found out so I ordered a spare card
No, I'm just a man.
So she wouldn't be afraid no one's come
I didn't go, yeah, it's hot, I can do it, the main thing is you've taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you're out of town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babin Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we celebrated 80 years of mass shots by German soldiers of the U.S. Jews in Babin Jar.
I had the privilege of speaking after three heads of State, including the President of Germany.
He was talking about "the common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their way and life in a territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
This is the basis we need to defend, as well as part of our responsibility for our history.
If "the evil demons of the past show up today in new clothes," he said, "then for us Germans, there can be only one answer: Never again!
The fight has to last."
Today, Russia has attacked a country of peace, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved the inhabitants of the cities it has blocked, and lets them die of disease.
Russia’s forces have fired massively at the Ukrainians, even visibly like the one in Babin Jar.
For over a month, the Germans see it in real-time news.
Yes, Germany implements sanctions, provides humanitarian assistance, as well as weapons, which, not long ago, was unimaginable.
Germany is delaying the delivery of the heavy arms needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means more than just opposing the swastika.
This means fighting all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risk and sacrifice to conquer evil and to stop the atrocities that take place in Ukraine.
One song for you tonight
We agree, talk for a tour, and write when to be gathered
All the sick only Lydia didn't get sick they had umicron a new kind of horse
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
That's the ticket I'm using instead of the car.
Defend for the lateness of the documents.
The ticket cost me a 2000 guinea piggy.
Sergei Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO has no longer been a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of the Ukrainians were against joining NATO, and only 18% of the interviewees spoke in favor.
After the Revolution of Greed, the flight of Victor Janukovich, the anexy of the Krim, and the start of the Donbasi war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and the supporters, on the contrary, to grow.
After the start of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian socialists have recorded a record level of support for Ukraine's entry to NATO among Ukrainians – over 75%.
Despite the support for Ukraine's entry into NATO and the help that it has provided in the context of war, there are now many criticisms of the Alliance and the country members – for the untimely provision of arms, the refusal to shut down the sky, the reluctance to "freak" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to give up its desire to join the Alliance through the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will be given secure security, including military guarantees.
In the new era of the Podcast "The Curse of the Question" together with the editor of the "European Truth" talk about how the Alliance has been helping Ukraine since the moment of the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance has been critical for no reason, why our prospect of joining NATO is as close as ever in history, and why the security guarantees discussed in the wars with Russia can become the second Budapest Memorandum.
What do you think is here
I have a volt partner that my application is on the table.
I've been putting it through this mobile plugin
We don't have a visa, we have to go to the convention center and find out how to do it, because it was in Poland, where we didn't get a visa, and we got a pesel.
We'll send you a message!
I was going to go to Denis in a good mood today.
I made a deal with a boy from Ukraine who I met yesterday, to meet in front of the school to show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
Because this is how I don't love, I don't have enough for a long time.
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks and combat vehicles to Ukraine.
I'm gonna leave the kids alone waiting for 3-4 years and go home 'cause I can't leave any more.
And we'll go with us for 6-7 in the morning.
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had a sincere feeling for this man, but he didn't do very well and I left him.
After a while, he returned and asked me to forgive him.
I said no to him.
After a while, he called for a heart surgery.
Asked him to just catch up with me, and I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported it for almost half a year.
In that time, we had a lot of communication.
I had a problem at work in parallel.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual help.
And I was thinking, maybe you really need to look at it differently.
And he asked me to get married, and two days later he died.
So it was God who decided on our fate.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he only speaks Czech.
I wanted to tell you that I was able to find a place to live, and I'm very proud of it. I have a place to live and a place to be with a kid.
Did I have to remember earlier?
( ) After all, I was helping to watch the kids in the family.
Just write down the sentences you didn't get.
I understand myself that the translator does not always translate the text properly.
I don't know how to talk to the doctor, do you think she's supposed to give the paper?
This must have been forgotten, I put it in my cupboard.
Maybe it's time for you to go to bed to work tomorrow.
Can anyone help, the things needed for a woman the size of an XS or a S is 165. And for her daughters (8, 10, 12 years) Thank you.
That time in the ice, I bought two packs, and my mom bought two.
It's very nice of you, thank you.
You made me feel better.
All right, let's talk about something else, and I'm not sleeping, I'm still sleeping, and I'm dreaming about bombarding...
God is never late, all his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I understand very well the cost of incompetent work, and I know that the kind of work I had at home in Kyiv I can't have the money I've made at home, and I don't get it here either.
But just sit down and do nothing, I can't do it, because then all the bad thoughts in my head are dripping up so you have to do something physical.
At the airport, the documents are from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m., and you can just wait another time.
The Lord returned at 4:00 a.m.
So we took them with us.
We slept in the kitchen with Vic, and they put them in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job and go to the airport with them.
When you have it, write and find out what's next...
'Cause I don't have a place anymore.
Mr., please, these are the invitations of the Ukrainian children who will be joining the gymnasium.
Yeah, but I'm doing it hard.
Okay, text me when it's handy.
I don't know about work yet.
It's better if we change things sometimes.
I'm sorry, I don't really have a missed call in the middle.
I'm offering work, cleaning up the bathroom and toilet, washing three windows, washing the dust.
Work is about 3-4 hours, 800green is one-time, from 1904 Tuesday, from 2:00 p.m.
I hope I'll just tell you that we're good.
Can I call you?
Or can you write your wife's contact?
Grisko started coughing, I want to ask you what I can get at the pharmacy.
I'd like to ask you some advice.
We have Anna as the root name of Anja.
She was handed by her uncle from the house.
Made the English version, added new partners
Write to him if you need anything.
Just don't forget me, please.
Are the classes on Monday and Wednesday different?
Thank you very much, you're doing a lot for our family, we're all very grateful to you.
You need help to stay in the pool
But that's what I think.
She was out of the house my uncle passed the rollers and the skateboard, she rolled at home, so it's got
I got up at 9:00, too, and I'm just getting my breakfast ready now.
I'm very sorry you're in touch with me on your weekend, and I hope I'm not very irritable.
We want to report a change in the home and also submit the documents for the card extension
We're now delivering medical oxygen to all the hospitals in our country.
I also forgot to tell you there's gonna be lunch tomorrow.
One mom said she'd make doughnuts with jam for the kids.
He's coming to you at the house.
Please tell me, do you have even an approximation of the month-to-month schedule, even for a reasonable understanding of what days?
I don't remember any of this schedule )
The Russian army is threatening to launch a missile attack on Kyiv, saying, "No, we haven't done it before."
Conashenkova's direct language: "We're trying to sabotage and try to hit the Ukrainian forces on the subject in the Russian Federation.
If such an incident persists, the Russian Armed Forces will strike the decision-making centres, including in Kyiv, from which the Russian army has previously been held.”
The Russians launched rocket attacks on Kyiv from the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces into Ukraine.
On February 25, the rest of the Russian rockets that hit the U.K. PSP system fell on a multi-family building in the late months of the city.
On February 26, a Russian missile landed on the Valery Lobanovskiy Prospect.
On March 1, the Russians hit a TV on the Roads near Babiny Yarou, killing five passersbys.
On March 2, the U.S. POS system bombed Russian missiles in the direction of the Ministry of Defence building over the South Railway Station.
On March 14, the wreckage of the hit-and-runs of the occupier's rocket shattered a building and a trollbus in Kurenivica in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a living mass on the vineyard, killing one man, and wounding another 19 people, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets destroyed the modern RETR Retroville on the Vineyard, killing at least four people.
The mayor of Kyiv, Vitalia Clichko, announced on April 13, that the city’s people, who had been evacuating the city, were still on their way back.
The army explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still launch rockets at Kyiv, and there were a lot of mines and undisturbed ammunition in the area of the capital.
The Department of Defence of Ukraine’s main intelligence agency warns on April 12, that the Russians are planning a series of terrorist attacks in the Russian Federation to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, a naphtobasa exploded near Bjelgorod in Russia, as a result of an air attack by U.S. helikopters.
At the beginning of April, the local authorities of Belgorod claimed that a “Ukrainian projectile” had fallen near the city.
Evidently, the elites in Washington, D.C., and Berlin, thrown in a cold sweat from the very idea that the Nazis would kill the Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky is not talking to them as much as to their choice and society in general.
With his speeches in Parliament and before the thousands of crowds on the major cities of Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that none of his predecessors have been able to reach.
Green won't convince European politicians to do anything for Ukraine, he's persuading the European peoples who choose the politicians.
And these speeches, this elegant alloy of power, the touch, and sometimes the despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
As long as the same Biden is categorical against the closing of the sky, 70% of its fellow citizens are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is against the speeding up of Ukraine's entry, this process is already under way.
I know what you mean, so I don't want to be seen as a con man.
The things you're going to pick up are better to give to people who need it more.
I can come to you and we'll figure it out.
But the air's clean, this is a plus.
It says I have a two-on-the-on-one fare, and I asked you to do the Internet.
I don't understand the terms of the fare
Do we have any other space today, or, as always, just go up and down?
So I'm on my way in that you're a train
But I won't stop loving you, you're everything to me.
This is a loan from a financial consultant.
So it takes a few days.
Kate asked for an Internet, can I give her a password?
I thought you and Milana didn't shoot each other.
Super then my man's gonna give me a ride 'cause he's got a car for today from the company where he works.
We are very happy and grateful that our Nick and grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you very much for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war we can invite you to Ukraine!
one has to be cut into four parts.
one of these can be used for two or three days, but splash every hour.
I'm interested in architecture and color.
I'm so glad you're okay.
At 4:20 p.m., the concert will start at 6:00, and then I'll be free again.
And now I want to eat something sweet
So I'll make a cup of tea and we'll get some candy.
I went to the school page and I'm gonna try and order ana lunch for tomorrow.
But go out on weekends in a lot of love
So can we go there tomorrow, find out the terms?
My name is Sacha, and I have come from Luganski to Prague.
I'm a certified masseuse and a 27-year-old nurse in neurology.
I'm offering medicinal massage, a rehab gym for children and adults.
I speak Ukrainian, Russian, and Czech intensively.
Contact: ---- I'd like a letter so that the Czechs can write to you via a translator, SMS is not here, they don't have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they do, you don't have a deal.
You really don't want this?
It helps people to see what they are worth and what they have for it.
If you don't need a primelist, I won't put it on.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I'll do it.
Dores you didn't want to write to me today... something
Don't worry, I didn't come to ask.
Actually, I'm just asking for attention today.
I have so much to say today, so I ask you to be patient.
Are you all right with your imagination?
You live your normal life, you go to work, you plan on shopping, you plan on vacation.
You have dreams.
You're going to buy this dress you saw last night at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can't take it.
He's flirting with the old reality.
You call at work, see if you can go out to work today or not.
Children decide to stay at home.
As long as it's clear.
There's hope... it's not all for long.
Now... they're gonna make a deal... something's gonna happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where do you want to go?
I've got $50 in my pocket.
A lot of people who are the bosses, we don't get a wage on our work.
Where do I go? Who needs me?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything from the house... you're gonna drive 1,000 miles.
You don't know what to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you're dragging the kids all over Prague.
We don't know how much, we don't know how much.
And we don't have one of every irons.
We have a choice -- to stay there and bring the kids in danger, or to try to get out of here.
She was very happy with the hearts and things the kids gave her when she got to school.
You needed to call me when you got here.
I'll text you at dinner.
Yes, I believe in God alone, and I believe in my life.
I don't have the strength to do it all.
I thought you'd been in love with a Ukrainian girl and you didn't have time to talk to her.
On the menu, I sorted it out, even ordered
2. Would you be interested in sharing with your Czech neighbors, friends, and the community?
If so, what type, type.
Please send a page with a Visa or a stamp (red with a date).
Without a visit for the refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian help.
Mrs. Libuche, you're the one who paid for the cradle?
I don't get it.
You're doing us so much good...
We owe you a big... thank you!
Yeah, I know it's very good.
I'm gonna send you a picture of a lady's visit I'm learning English.
Well, you can write it down tomorrow, see you or not, maybe you'll change your plans...
Good morning. We've got enough. It'd be so good to know a man from Ukraine.
If you want to, you can be with me after work.
Don't you want to meet me after 4:00?
What is your general impression from the first week
Corina brought us the meds the other day, and we drink them.
I can work with bedded sick and invasive kids.
But you have to tell me I'm talking only in Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have one.
Can I smear you a sweet for a trade?
'Cause it's just anti-bacterial gel.
I don't know, or I'm not much in the city... about half 12 yet.
What services/activities do you think are needed/unavailable for old people?
I don't know, 'cause there was no text from the bank and I didn't take the bank card, and the kids took out the bank attachment with it, and they made me very sad.
Then text me if you want to go.
Today we have the joy - our city of Butch was freed from the occupiers, and our wars prospered.
Now, if the enemy is cleaned, they're looking for the Russians in the basements and apartments.
The whole city has been replaced, and the change work will begin.
And Ivan would see if something needed to be repaired or something else done.
Diana, as you like.
Our mistress wants to stay at home, says he's getting tired of us, and he wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We'll do the masanne and do the homework.
These are the small businesses that have opened up the volunteer headquarters in their spaces and shops.
These are the tractors, who are actually going to the field under the shots, because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who agree to go in humconvoys today to temporarily occupied areas in order to get help and get the people out of there.
They're heroic leaders who go to the combat zone without fear, calm and help the refugees in the trains, and at the peaceful stations help the volunteers to load the humanitarians in the trains.
These are the gas stationers who were on the Gitomir Road in the early days of the war and patiently served the frightened and nervous.
They're communicators who take out trash under fire, fix pipes, and power lines to provide the people with the right things.
They're doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining about anything, and at the free moment they're still volunteering to pick up the meds on the front.
We're in Ukraine, running out of juice when we have little leaves)
Say, please, little kids-- what age do you mean?
My daughter's eight years old, is that age acceptable?
I'm looking for a home for my daughter and me for three or four days every day to go to the Czech Republic and hand over the passports for a visit to Canada.
In Warsaw, there are a lot of people in the Visa Center and there's no on-line queue.
I wanted to come one day, but it's far, it's taking a long time on the train, it's gonna be hard for the kid.
So I decided to look for a place in or near Prague.
No, we're fine.
Last Hardware to drop
But I can't change the passphrase when I follow a link, because I have this error:
It's in the microwave, something's burning.
In Ukraine, the operators of the largest banks are always in contact with clients 24 hours a day, and all questions are resolved quickly :)
Well, it's okay to get used to new realities.
I don't like it, and I want you to know it.
You can edit the report.
Yeah, TV's full of it.
We've already arranged for the fridges. Some Chechen guys have responded at 1:00 and help us move it.
I want to go to you, give you a strong hug, and kiss you.
At 7:30, I'm reading the history of the world's theatre to performers, directors, and theatricians.
I'm gonna appreciate the object tonight. After supper
Grisko still sleeps, at night weeping very much, licking the tooth .
I'm on the phone right now with everyone I know about Lvov, and a lot of people are dead.
The Czech Republic began to issue a visit after March 22, according to me.
By that time, you'd put stamps like this and then you'd match those stamps to a cab.
Ukraine's U.K. (U.S.A.A.) is an elective district that unites the elective areas outside the territory of Ukraine and consists of voting rooms in the embassies and consulates of Ukraine and in the military bases abroad, [vinc 1] where the country's peace-keeping forces (Cosovo and DDR Congo) are located.[1] The role of the District Election Commission for the Concord Election Circuit is played by the Central Election Commission.
In the foreign electoral district, there is only a state-wide vote: the election of the President and the people's deputies, and the universal referendums.
Local elections are not held.
They're at the train station at the mother's and child's room.
Says he doesn't know where to go any more.
Are you mad at me?
I'm gonna get a picture in my bathing suit.
I don't need any more money. I borrowed a long-term friend.
I wanted to say I've already connected a Czech mobile number.
So I didn't need another device, so I went to O2 and they made me an email SIM card, which I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
I'm very uncomfortable, Sunday is working and I can't.
You said you had a washing machine broken, take it for yourself, you need it very much, too.
We don't have enough carpets, swollen carpets, dishes. The kids don't have pyjamas and nothing to move into.
Good morning, I'll be on my way out at 10... write the address again, there's a text missing.
I don't want to torture you or myself, I'm gonna get in there somehow.
So it would be good, but I know there was no free space, and in principle, they now have all the classes on schedule, and they're doing pretty well.
Do you have a meat cutter to make the stuff?
Well let it be after the day.
Did your mom say something hurt you last night?
She can't tell them what she wants, and she doesn't know what they're talking about.
I went to school today, too.
I saw Christina's mom today, but she didn't even say hi (
Very tasty apples, what kind of class is this?
The head of the Office of President Andrew Jermack has informed us that Russia is starting a “fee-operation” on the arms that the allies are handing over to us.
The direct language of Jermocus is, "They know they're losing war, they see their backwardness, and they want to "kill" the supply of arms by any means.
For example, one of the last fairies is the total destruction of the U.S.S.S.S.S.A. 300.
This information has already been stifled by Mr. Eduard Heger.
We know the scripts of the Russians, the name of one of them.
They can launch the fencing that the U.K. soldiers are making a big deal of arms from the allies, and it's massively moving on to arming the Russian army.
I'd like to warn you about those fags right now.
For the arms in the hands of the U.S.S. Warriors send the enemy to that world.
Excuse me, have you forgotten to ask me how much it cost to have a garden in the month, and will it work in the summer?
Everyone is given the strength.
There are a lot more dubious stories, believe me.
So I needed to live up to this in order to change.
In the Torah it is written, and God created a bad start in man to make it change in the way of life, to become better
This is your home, you can invite anyone you want)
How do we find this lady in social security tomorrow before we go to the hospital wanted to go to the city hall
He listened to his mom and didn't come with us.
I know you've been having a hard time.
And I'll make you happy.
After what you texted me today, I'm happy.
I hope you meant it seriously.
I'm watching the ad a lot of time. Now it's hard for us to do this.
I'm sorry, I didn't get the whole point.
You didn't get a call today to change the mobile operator's rate?
I'm sorry, but I can't count on anyone in this life.
Today, I was offered a job for every day.
I'm sorry, but I agreed to work there.
Thank you for responding and wishing you a good help.
Perhaps your dad told us that there are Jehovah’s Witnesses among us, but I do not profess any religion.
But she was baptized in the Orthodox Church.
I respect all the religions that are based on love.

We cleaned up the whole room and moved to the second room.
The international community has continued to express shock and resentment after the evidence has emerged that Russian forces have committed atrocities against the civilian population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these reports as a “provocation. ”
“The report of dead, raped, and seriously wounded by the Russian forces of the Ukrainian peace-keepers is worth the conviction,” said New Zealand's prime minister, Jasinda Ardern, to the reporters in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia has to answer the world for what they've done,” she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
The Prime Minister of Japan, Fumio Kissida, called the incidents a “violation of international law”.
It was reported that hundreds of civilians had been shot and thrown into mass graves or left on the streets in the outskirts of Kyiv, in Bucha, by Russian forces who had left the area after the occupation for a few weeks.
Photographs of the bodies of the civilians who had been killed with their hands tied up have shocked many, and have led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, announced to the radio interview on April 4, that there are signs that Russian forces have committed “war crimes” in Butch.
“What happened in Butch requires a new round of sanctions and very clear actions,” Macron said, adding that the additional sanctions should be directed to the Russian export of coal and oil.
The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sánchez, stated that Russian forces could go so far as to commit a “genocide” in Butch.
“We will make sure that those who have committed these war crimes do not go unpunished,” said Sanchez in Madrid.
In her national TV appearance late on April 3, Russia’s MSS Spokesman Maria Zecharov rejected the charge as a “prosecution. ”
She said, without proof, that the United States and NATO had ordered a picture to discredit Russia.
“In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the material was made does not give rise to any doubt as to who ordered the story,” said Zechariah.
In the past, the Russian Ministry of Defence has also unproved that the Bouchi image is “a further order of the Kiwi regime” and that all the Russian forces left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Butch.
On April 4, a follow-up committee of Russia issued a statement in which it announced a “investigation” for the charge of “knownly false information” on the actions of the Russian forces in Butch.
The President of Ukraine, Volodymir of Zelenski, spoke on April 3, blaming the Russian forces for “genocide” in the city, and told the Kremlin’s leaders that they should come to Butchi to see what their military forces had done.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being implemented,” said Zelenski in a videotape, moving from the Ukrainian to the Russian language.
And there's a shared responsibility.
For the murders, for the torture... for the shots at the gunman," he said.
He said that Russia’s president, Volodymir Putin, and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of the forces in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don't get it," he said about the scenes of the victims scattered in the streets of Butchi, a city about 35 km northwest of Kyiv.
On April 2, a reporter from the Ukrainian Service Radio Liberty saw a small city on the streets of a body as if it were a civilian.
In just one place, the reporter saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
The AP reporters have seen at least 21 bodies in different places in Butchi.
The bodies of one group of nine, all in a civilian group, were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to the locals, used the Russian forces as a base.
The victims seem to have been killed from a short distance.
Generally, the Ukrainian authorities claimed that the bodies of at least 410 civilians had been found in the area of Kyiv, which had been controlled by the Russian forces until last week.
Thank you, it's all there, we got it from the list.
"They've been told, "Kyiv's not." How the invaders took the Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things, such as robbing, rape, murder, and torture.
There is another point in this list that is now much less known – the removal of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
About the middle of March, Russian occupiers “evacuate” Ukrainians from temporarily occupied localities to their territory and to the area of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko has actually given to the Russian military politico.
"Ukrainian Truth" has found the Ukrainians who have been taken out and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is taking place, and if there are ways to go back to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text have been forced to evacuate voluntarily outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from no means of escape.
Happily, they live and maintain contact with their family.
However, in view of the claims made by the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe duress.
So in Melitopole, the Russians stole the staff of the second courthouse, took the children out of there without their parents, including the 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of a dead U.K. champ from Joseph Zacepinski's swim.
The family of Alexander, Marina, and their 10-year-old daughter, Wally, moved to Guestomel a few months before the war.
Alexander was the one who got a job at Antonov Airport, which is two and a half km from the village.
The family settled in a military town, even though it was a civilian.
As true plumbers, Denis and Marina pre-assembled the alarmed boulders, but in the morning of the 24th of February, they didn't get enough to evacuate.
They didn't have a car, and the suburban bus was gone.
At about 12:00 p.m. on the 24th of February, they saw a helicopter with a Latin letter V, followed by the first rockets.
One of them got into the next house.
The family then went down to the cellar and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, about 40 people were hidden in their cellar.
Not all of them decided.
"On the 6th of February 24th, people who spoke non-Russian and non-Ukrainian came in.
They say, "Anyone?" - I say so. - "Get out!"
They searched me, asked me who was in the cellar, if there were any weapons.
All the men were interrogated if they had served in the army.
The women were told, "We've come to defend you on Ramzan Kadir's instructions."
It was the Chechen OMON, not even the army, the 25-35-year-olds.
They said, "We've been aided in the war by the Ukrainians, Sasko White (managed the nationalist UNA-UNOSO Viking, who was fighting on the Chechen side of the first Russian-Chetsian war, UP), and we've come to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what was missing.
We say the water, there was a big problem with it.
They shattered the shop, took the goods out of there under the "Russians will take it anyway" charge, and brought us six bouts.
There are also videos on the Internet where the kids thank the Cadder for the food.
So they're the ones who, after the shop robbery, brought the mat and said, "We know it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmatovic."
No one really wanted to talk, but they made a pretty cut.
Our kid in there says, "You have seven days to hand over our phones," they laughed.
They also kept separate from the Russians.
They say it's a good thing they're here, 'cause they didn't want war, the Ukrainians are backed up, and they're all good, "Putin's a freak, Kadir too, but there's nothing we can do, 'cause our families are there."
And most of the time, they didn't fight, they used to go robbing shops, they used to rob shops.
The chicken was put on, the one was tied to one leg by a georgian tape, and the other was his white scotch, and it was called a "milly."
They didn't come to Ukraine well-prepared.
I don't know how their intel worked... when they got hit in Butch, so they didn't even take the dead, they asked us, "Do you have artillery?"
More than that, we had a misguided brawl — the Chechens didn't know each other, and in the early days, they asked for passwords to find out whether they were theirs or not.
We had them by March 13th, after which a Russian OMON arrived, followed by an Omian trooper.
They put 30-40 units of technology between the houses -- ours have been in it all the time from the Bayrackers.
But they come and tell us that the VMS is gone, but there's "Azov," and they say, "Azova" is so thousands of hundred in Ukraine.
Called "Kyiv has already given up" and it's been going on since early March.
One day a Russian came to us – either an officer of the station or a representative of the FSB – and said there would be an evacuation.
And we've been listening to the radio -- it was about Bucha, the Hotel, and we thought maybe we'd get a green hallway.
From the start, we gave the Chechens our lists, and they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're being taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
And they said, "Well, you have to feel bad about your kids' mentality!"
As it worked, they put us in the cellar and started shooting from under the house, or "The Mountains" or "The Minomets."
And then it came back... the homes in the neighborhood just burned down, some of them fell down.
There was a direct intervention in our house on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to pass on to the border and the Red Cross.
Part of it didn't go, saying it was for the traitors of the country -- he said, "You're shot up there, you're sold to the organs."
We were taken through the Blackmobile, on both sides of the road, with a decommissioned technique, even though the whites told us that the Russians were moving to them immediately.
There's a lot of caponers, buried tech, and soldiers.
At the white point of the Space pass, we went through an impromptu control, and a lot of people didn't have any documents at all, because they burned down.
We've been set up in the tents of the Red Cross, and we've been given a cup of tea.
And this is where we hear the shots!
Although they from the Belorian Red Cross said, "Oh, no, it's the planes that fly, turn on the border."
But we're from the air, we have an education, we know what this is.
We were then loaded on a bus and taken to the Chonkie sanatorium near Gomel.
His headman, Wenger Vasil Stepanovic, has come, says, "Here, I'm a forelock, I'm from Black.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenk will not stop until your thieves are slaughtered.
The poor people are suffering!
And we've got Lukashenko so good!
He'll say whatever he says."
They offered to give an interview to the white press, but no one wanted to.
The sanatorium administration told us, "You're already a traitor!"
And people from the Red Cross and the United Nations (at least so called) spread misinformation that men cannot go to Poland.
A lot of people believed it, and they were afraid to get out of Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents – our daughter didn't have a foreign passport.
We were supposed to get it on Monday, and the war began on Thursday.
At the U.K. consulate, we had no help, and at the station in Minska, we were told that no one would get on the bus without their passports.
I'll tell you what we've been doing with the help of the Belarusian volunteers.
We were settled in Minsko, and we were followed up.
In the sanatorium, they didn't have any power.
Our second group of migrating representatives said you could live here for a maximum of a week, because Belarus is not Europe, and there's no payment.
We found an inside transporter who wanted to take us to Warsaw.
As we pass near Mosir (about 50 km from the U.S. border – U.S.), we have seen the launch of ballist missiles on Ukraine: the rocket first flies, it is beautifully glows, and then it goes off.
People who boarded a bus in Moziri told us that the Russians there are always shooting with polygons.
But I can say that white men don't want to fight.
The generals are getting out of the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was invited.
But the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, is not at all believed.
They say, "You're lying, we're a people of peace."
It is not understood that their polygons are used to target Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting to take us to Estonia.
Now we're going to go through the registration, we're going to decide what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, the Ukrainian flags are now, of course, as much as the Estonian flags."
Marina lived in a military town in Guestomalie with her brother's family, his wife and two children, 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24, she phoned her nieces and asked them to pick up the most needed items and documents.
In the evening, they went to sleep in the cellar of the next house.
Marina herself has not been able to return home, and in principle she will not be able to do so; the house is no longer there.
No one really knew anything about the evacuation.
Can't you go downtown on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything. We're always waiting for you.

On April 1, the city head of Butchi, Anatoly Fedorouk, delivered a joyful message: On March 31, the Ukrainian military freed the city from Russian invaders.
The next day, the occupiers were thrown out of the whole of Kyiv.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians would have felt at this time was overshadowed by terror and hatred, as it was also known that at least 280 civilians had been shot by the Russians alone.
They've been killed on the street, someone's hands are tied up and shot in the back, some of the dead are underage.
Killed and tracked by torture, the village head of Motizin Olgu Suchenko, her husband, Igor, and Alexander’s son, who were abducted on March 23th.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in a fraternal grave, and Igor in a sewer.

President Volodymyr of Zelenski stated that certain types of armament being provided by Western partners had come too late.
In an interview with the Associated Press, published by the Office of the President, he writes "European Truth."
"All the equipment, all they're sending, for some kind of equipment, it's done late.
So what do we say, for example, when we talk about Mariopole, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, it's true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you can see the value of these changes," said Green.
On the question of whether it was enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president said, "No, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine had been a member of NATO, there would have been no war, or it would have been different.
"It would have been different, we'd have the shoulders of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be a war,' he added.
Remember, the British prime minister has promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armor and anti-ship weapons.

So far, three of us (me and the kids three years and 17 years old) may later have a man move to us, for he is still in the group.
How long are the courses going on, and on what level of language can be calculated after they are completed?
Great, so I'm free on Monday.
And it-it was very good for me.
I'll get all the stuff ready.
I have a superbook where the Czech language is one step at a time.
The only thing I'd ask for is if it was 13:00 to 14:00, 'cause I'm working by 12:30.
To get to that place.
No one after the war. No one you didn't think.
Answer me straight.
You want to be with me?
How do you feel about me?
What can I do to convince you?
You can go there every weekend and don't get irritated.
Can you tell me how to get to the shop?
So the Czechs are very good people, I've come on vacation to my kids 10 and 15 years old and my grandmother (received in Marianski lazna)
These women don't get it.
We're offering a free stay.
We live in a village in a big family home with a big orchard and a closed courtyard between Jevela and Gowlikov Brod.
We have two little kids.
We'll get a room.
Kitchen, bathroom, and other spaces are shared.
But first, the month of study, which will start on April 13.
On the Web, there's a TV picture, please ask if you can come up today.
He says he's comfortable on the sofa, don't worry.
If anything, we'll think of something.
Thank you so much for your concern.
We can meet a lot.
My husband can bring him to your house tomorrow or Saturday, if that suits you.
No phone rings, the guy's chained up, I know God is with him.
Okay, then we can go to the playground next to the river.
For all your time if you don't have your family right now means that you didn't come what it means when you're gonna have it 10 times bigger and closer than it would have been
I can't download, I have an old phone.
I think they're looking for a baker who speaks English.
But if this document is to be unprinted as I have done it, you have to download it to the computer first.
Must look like this.
Give us a pyloscope for tomorrow so we can clean up.
And then we have to ask... it depends on the weight and the size...
Thank you, we've learned something like this.
All right, let's go, get very tired.
So if no one can come, there will be no harm?
I sent an email address to the document
It's just the status we've been spending this time together...
There's resentment in front of you, and there's a lot of it... and I can't hold on to it....
You can get us the papers, the work contract.
This is a big, yellow, and strong robot.
Sending a second message to mom
Thank you for something, but I don't have to go anywhere anymore. I need to get ready and talk, and I can do it tomorrow at half-ten.
Marina, but indeed, if you need help with the city, my husband and I will.
My friend and I baked last night, try if you want.
Everyone was sick, and they had symptoms, but we didn't go to the hospital.
I just got a call from a lady from Dameidlo, and she said that they were e-mailing me information about what was going on, and I never gave an answer.
She spoke Czech, and I got her so clear.
But on e-mail I don't have a letter from the lady
I need a little plaster to get a failure on the plaster.
Type or type of household activity
We're looking for a mistress to clean up the house here in the village.
Offer of 150 kroner/year.
Other cooperation is in line with pleasure.
The date you will agree with the lady on your own.
Of course, but I'm knocking you off the bar.
Men have a lot of nuances, too.
He was a very rich man, but he liked me because I had my point of view in life. I met with him, and then I left him.
He was a very rich man, and after a while, he phoned and told him he had a heart operation.
Asked me to just have a nap with him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man, and he thought I might be his toy, and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer.
"The car was in my backyard, like a crocodile, and she let go of her groves.
And they kept me in the house, and then they took me to the cellar, and there were a lot of people, about 400 people, and there was nothing to breathe.
And what about the place you've taken the picture
I didn't really get there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already simplified this facade.
The last two videos I'll see when the Internet will work normally.
Is there a dress code at work, or can we go in what we have?
Okay, he'll come over there and take it.
I don't want anything
I know I can't sit with you. I have to work.
Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 or even Ukrainian TV.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1+1 is a pro-presidential, propagandist channel, not at all interesting to me.
What happened at the bus stop with the man the police and the ambulance arrived?
Diana didn't answer me, and you didn't.
All right, I just need to print out the picture for the kids, so it'll be okay.
But perhaps you need a more detailed knowledge of the Czech language.
I'm worried you'll be content with my work.
In this case, I know a girl who's a Ukrainian, but she's a student in the Czech Republic, to specialize in tourism.
You really don't want to come in with the kids for a moment, quietly and with your grandmother.
I want you to be with me, wake up next to you.
In fact, it’s a hard thing to do in a foreign country, and every day they want to go home.
Mrs Agatha, if you want this picture, I'll take a picture.
Thank you for trying to get us a better life here.
I'll remember you for the rest of my life.
And I'm gonna remember and laugh at it.
So thank you very much ania still charting a path in the geolocation in the phone so we can get to the quickest
I have to pay the fare, I have to control.
How can I see how much we use?
And how do I pay?
"I'm telling her "the remodeling of the TV and the radio" has been tightened up by the import details, and friends and acquaintances have been warned not to be overwhelmed by the phone."
"For the whole month, we hide from the infu mother-in-law of war.
So far, it's working.
However, in Plymka (Cuska - O.C.) on his nose and his back paws froze, which may be a result of stress, a change in the stern, and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are out, and I don't have the stress, I'm sorry.
The bottle, unlike the beetle, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions."
Because of Olga's poor hearing and spending most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law spent the month in a flat with her "incognito."
And April 1st, 93-year-old Oksana Polova, for the first time in her life, took up arms.
"33 days I, like a partisan, lived with her in the apartment.
The war was hidden from it, and the fact that I was in front of her, was formally coming as usual for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her the receiver -- she listened for four hours, then sang for two hours."
The radio receiver was always at bed.
My mother - in - law spends most of her time in her room.
He didn't hear well, so he let me be inconceivable to her.
If I'd heard the sound of her "things," I hid in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and the TV.
And then I phoned everyone who was in touch with her, and that's 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but war.
I'm asking my friend, she was there from the start to the end
It's April 17th - I've got two apartments cleaned :)
Good evening, I didn't think about it:)
Hey, if we need our help tomorrow, we can come.
Do you have to order lunch, can you take lunch from the house? Do you have to print it out, do you have to print it out and I'll sign it?
I suggest a man's haircut, a woman's hair, a child's leave for you, all the saturated, please write in a personal message, a price:
I understand you, and I don't complain, but in my situation, I'm gonna be looking here for a while.
I'm telling you, the embassy is a bit here,
The British, who in the U.S.A. defended Maryupol, says he's ready to give up to the Russians.
The British, who is a member of the Marine Corps of the U.S. Armed Forces, who is involved in the defence of Maryupol, told his friends and family that they would make up arms and turn themselves into a prisoner of the Russian occupiers.
Source: twitter page of Aydin Aislin, a British who has served in the U.S.S. lava since 2018, Air Force with links to the family and friends of Ayslin, Atlas News with a reference to the words of a friend of Ayslin, who spoke to him
"We've got a message from him, "48 days ago, we've tried everything we can to protect Maryupol, but we don't have a choice but to go into captivity to the Russian forces.
We don't have any food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war will soon end."
Details: Aislin was a member of the 36th separate Marine Corps of the U.S. Marines, who is involved in the Mariopole Defence Operation.
Air Force reporters have been in touch with En Wood's mother, and she has confirmed that her son has been on the phone to tell her that they're planning to go into captivity.
The second warlord, Brennan Philips, also confirmed to the reporters that in his last phone call, Islin had been talking about the plans of their capitulation unit.
According to him, the crew ran out of ammunition and food.
The reporters of Atlas News contacted a friend of his who said that the Aislin unit was going to go into captivity to the Russian subdivisions so that it would not get caught without arms and bullets in the hands of the so-called “coordinators”.
Also in the social media, there was an audio recording of a phone conversation at which Acelyn was supposed to be talking to a friend of his who knew the American who was planning to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Acelyn said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
The British earlier told us that he was threatened at Instagram by a private military company, Wagner.
Aislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to fight against the so-called "islamic State" terrorists in Syria.
In 2018, he officially entered the USB lava and made an oath.
Aislin's friends and loved ones called Johnnie, and in the social media, he's more famous under the name Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know if we're together or not.
But it won't be easy, you're gonna have to find it...
You offered to go with you, I agreed if it was okay.
Thank you, before you need to, you've done so much for us, we're very grateful to you.
If you don't want to write to me again, I'll be waiting.
Hey, Natali, please water the flowers out at the front door.

A brother in the war in Mariopole, a second in Zaporizha, and a man from Kyiv today was transferred to Harkow.
The phones say every day it's okay, and there's someone who knows it, they're still not gonna tell the truth.
I wanted to see you, but I wanted to do some more work.
I'll ask the man in the morning if he can make it tomorrow.
When you get home, write me, please, I'd need to talk to Daniel.
The big-time attackers for their loss played a full part in the fight.
A teacher, Dmitr Paulisky, an unknown relative, was shot by a young man, Boris Alexander.
Their bodies have been thrown into a “threatening filth that has been sown by the earth”.
Behind the memory, “there was some dead quiet in the city. ”
Rarely, one of the residents ran from the house to the house.
On the streets, the bodies of the Bolsheviks rolled together all the time.
And I might actually follow you, I need you, I can't without you.
3. What kind of activity/activity would help you or your friends to adapt to life in the Czech Republic?
But you're not going to get there, because the railroad is being rebuilt and the train is closed.

I want to be able to thank everyone who has helped us, for this was the last hope, indeed.
I'm not afraid of work, as I used to live in the countryside, so I can and I like to work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
It's a very interesting tradition, we do this at Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved the 7176 law-promoting object, which is called "To make possible the monitoring of potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economic field."
Surprisingly, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the field of economics has been the place where the members of the Watchdog Council of Tenders and Banks are meeting.
Initiators believe that the decision-making by the Supervising Council of the Superintendent in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve Ukraine’s national security problems.
We know that there are a lot of new dangers to the hosts, but we don't know yet about any company that has become required to physically attend the watchdogs at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is an excellent basis to “remove” all the gains in the hard reform of the post-revolution of the Government, including the independent oversight of the board, and then set up a manual administration.
It's like it was before 2015.
Why would the company keep the board watch, and who should join them?
And what's more, if, under patriotic slogans, one harmful law-promoting object "flys" tomorrow, other things can fly out – for example, a system of government purchases through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU can be shattered.
A lot of things can be written off for war.
By the way, this initiation was made before the start of the war and the legal object 7176.
So on February 22, this rule was added to the comparative table of subject 5397.
In general, the desire to disengage the board in one way or another has been circulating among some of the people’s chosen ones for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but to show the possible effects of a legal object, let us look at the arguments that explained the need to accept it.
And then we'll give you our suggestions on how to deal with the issue of the management of strings during the war.
The first deputy of the Minister of the Economy, Dennis Cudin, explained the need for such a new kind of risk of Internet loss and other means of communication, which would make it impossible for the remote work of the watchdog board to be done.
In other words, the risk is that the Board of Visitors will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which may result in the paralysis of the company's work.
We agree that such a risk is, but will it be able to prevent members of the Watchdog Council from moving to Ukraine?
Let us imagine a very cynical situation in which independent members of the watchdog board (who make up the bulk of the entire body) put their personal security above the company’s interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In that case, according to the law, they can be freed.
And then, more of all, it's going to lose the cohort, the necessary watchful joy to make any decisions.
On the other hand, it will not work quickly to assign new independent members of the Board of Governors, as the law prescribes the need for a competitive selection, which lasts an average of 3 to 4 months.
So the 7176 law - provoking decision is more likely to not be able to keep the oversight board from losing the ability to make a decision, but rather to do so!
The People ' s MP, the author of Dmitro Natalia ' s law-promoting body, puts forward other arguments to support it.
In particular, he observes: "Many businesses, such as the Defence and Industrial Complex (PPC), are now in need of repositioning" and so "it's hard to imagine that a man can, for example, talk about addresses and other sensational information from Vienna on Zoom."
For starters, there are very few OPCs in Ukraine that have oversight of the board.
The Watchdog Council is not in the Ukroprom Prom, which is actually running almost all of the PKK's guinea pigs.
But even in Ukroprom, according to the law, the board has very limited powers, and all its members do not have a free basis.
The full power of Ukro-Bornochrome is vested in the Director-General, who will, in fact, make a decision as to the need to re-locate a PKK company that is part of the company.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to the criticism, even if the 7176 bill does not make any changes to the law that governs the operation of the PKK structuring.
Mr. Dmitro also puts arguments on his Facebook page that can be classified as "emotional".
Such arguments tend to have nothing to do with the improvement of the efficiency of the work of hosts and bankers, but let's try to look at some of them: "Aweful foreign experts at the first word "war", as far as 2021, leave Ukraine, but they are left with members of the Watchdog Council in Ukraine's state enterprises with a full salary of a few hundred thousand quintiles, while Ukraine itself is in a real state of war."
First of all, it's a manipulation -- most of these watchdogs have never lived in Ukraine and have come here from time to time.
So it's not fair to say they're leaving Ukraine.
Second, as a result of the Coronary Pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the Watchdog Board have long been engaged in online sessions.
This tool has long been common in world practice, and in very different fields: business, education, medicine, etc.
Also, we should not forget that membership in the Watchdog Union is not a full-time job.
Typically, such people have other things to do, and that's what the electronics are doing to help them do.
Third, all of these statements are read as claims to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dimitro does not make an identical claim to the members of the Watchdog Council, who are Ukrainians?
And they're not behind their company's location either.
In short, this is not the first populist attempt to get the foreigners out of the Watchdog Council, and war is just a new opportunity.
I'm in Ukraine, looking for options for temporary family support, with me two kids.

We usually need an adult's passport.
In the Bróvarsk, Vishgorod, and Buchanan regions of Kyiv, which have been freed from the occupiers, they will set up a two-day high commanding hour.
The direct language of Paulus: "In the towns of Brovarsky, Vishgorod and Buchanas, which were under Russian occupation and freed by the U.S. Defence, the commanding hour has been increased!
In the area of these towns and villages, the limits will be from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the shelling, at this time it is categorically forbidden to stay on the streets of localities and other public places, to travel and to walk.
Residents can only go out on an alarm signal to get into hiding.
Such limitations are put in place to deal with the effects of Russian aggression – to clean up and transform the territory.
The scavenger called on the people who had left the area for the time being to stay away from their return.
After all, the commanding hour will last from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day.

The Serbian defense budget has been growing exponentially for a number of years.
In all, over the past six years, Serbia has invested over two billion euro in the modernization of the army, the updating of military technology, and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places on the list of the world's most powerful military states.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the Western countries took a very serious view of the prospect of a possible upheaval in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complex and globalized.

I don't want to take her with me. Baby-sitter services are for much smaller children. Can I take her?
Use of a service car and cost recovery
Not here where we've been with Mr. Peter supper watching this house we've got a lot of fun

Lucašenka’s regime has held three whiterows for 27 and 28 years, involved in the destruction of two relay booths of an alarm set under the Osipovic, which provides for the movement of rail trains.
Source: "Rady of Svaboda", right-wing center of Wisna, head of the MAF criminal police, Gennady Kasakevich, quoted by the Belta.
In the MIF of Belarus, it was reported that on the night of March 30, three Beaver Islanders had been detained for force support from the SDR, one of whom was injured.
According to the "Embark" report, when the men were held up, they were active in resisting and trying to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical institution.
Another was given on-site medical care.
The head of the MBC criminal police, Bilorussia Gennady Kasakevich, stated that "the acts of terror on the RB railroad will be severely halted" by the armed forces.
On April 6, it was reported that on March 30, the police detained another Belarus railroad co-worker, a member of the Baranowitz Division of the BZD, and an administrative officer of the BZD thematic resources in Vkontakte and Valentine Samasyuk's "Single-owners" .
Where he is now and in which state he is unknown, @belzhd_live.
By the end of March, at least 40 railroads were delayed for sabotage in Belarus.
Remember, the formation of the BYpol, which was declared by the Lukashenka regime to be extremist, continues to call on the whiterows to sabotage rail transport and Belarus infrastructure in the Peragogo plan.
The Belarusian "rival guerrillas" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As we know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is moving to the United States to fight, to live in strength and technology.
It's to raise self-esteem.
Do you like to read books?
And in phone mode, they don't work for Easter, either?
Can you do this on the phone any day or no day?
Even a separate law was passed on this matter
We've been here for four days, so it's just a terror, not a road.
They ran through the city of Irpin, Kyiv, and there was terror, shooting, sirens.
I love them, too.
Silvia, Mashie from the Clétsana hasn't got the money yet, can we call them?
Yeah, I'll tell them, I think they'll be home.
There are different Muslims, there are fanatics, and there are true believers.
The meaning of jihad is interpreted in a different way by different Muslims.
But to be honest, I'm very uncomfortable doing it for money.
You've done me a lot of good.
I can do it free of charge.
Temporarily while we're looking for a university, then you'll usually need a permanent stay.
But maybe she'll have a place to stay. (Looking for Prague, Brno, and other places)
I'm not far from Prague right now, we have a car, we're ready to pay for a part of the living.
A city or a village is of no importance, if it is to be a separate home.
I bumped something into the water phone and wired up two unnecessary shares for which the cost was cut and I can't shut it off.
And I also took the money off the card that didn't have it on.
And I don't know what the money was for.
The cost of the repairs is paid by the owner = Mr. Deedina.
Tuesday, stay at home and wait for the repair workers.
Do you need a cigarette?
Can we change the mobile rate if you have time?
The US bans investment in the Russian Federation and imposes sanctions on Putin's daughters.
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is putting in place new sanctions against the daughters of the RF President Putin, the largest banks of the RF Alpha Bank and the Siberbank, and bans all new investment in Russia.
This is in a report on the White House.
Silverbank is Russia’s largest financial institution, which is owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets in the US financial system, and ban U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will impose a complete ban on new investment in the Russian Federation.
To this end, US President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investment in Russia by US citizens, irrespective of their location.
"This step is based on a decision by more than 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The output of the private sector includes producers, energy companies, big divisive traders, financial institutions, as well as other service providers, such as legal and consulting companies,” is in the White House Statement.
The third step in new US sanctions has been to limit the size of Russia’s major state enterprises in the critical field.
This will ban U.S. citizens from doing business with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the U.S. jurisdiction.
A detailed list of Minfin will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the total blocking of the assets of the adult children of Putin, the wife and daughter of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lavrov, as well as the members of the Security Council of Russia, including the ex-president and prime minister of Russia, Dimitri Medvedev and Prime Minister Michael Mishustina.
Sanctions disable them from the US financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.
You can only get to this place, keep the drive closed, and I'll come to you.
Vira, can we wash the dishes in the car?
My name is Olga, before the war, I was a flight manager for SkyAp, my mom was an industrial sewer, my son-in-law, Makarczyk went to the orchards.
We had a fine life, but we didn't even think we'd have to run, for we don't have the strength to hide in the cellar.
I was lucky to find a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
So we have the hope that someone will take us in for the first time.) We can even pay for a room or a flat, but if it's in our pocket.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We don't have bad habits.
Let us be grateful for such help at such a time that is not easy for us.
After lunch, I had a lecture in English, and then I went to work in the children's room.
I was there explaining to Margarity how to fill out all the files.
I hope she's got it all figured out, and she'll do it all right.
And I also met Mrs. Lena and her to talk about swimming for the Ukrainian kids.
She brought an ad from the pool.
It's a free-of-charge swim.
You can call the school, Kiera won't pick up her phone, she won't answer, I don't know if she got to school.
They're isolating the Russian office: stop investment and stop the supply.
But we didn't get it.
We didn't have any military in the house.
Our home is near the military unit and naphtobasa
He was just helping me because I couldn't do it on my own.
Nicely cooked, I don't ask for it, and I give you good advice
I'm doing my best.
I'm having a bit of a hard time, but I know I have to go through this phase.
I'll meet you on Thursday and tell you everything.
Everything's okay.
How often do you clean up?
I clean up every week.
I'm sorry I don't have a program, but I'm gonna try to figure it out.
I Dreamed to be a teacher
My girls can't move out right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you if you'd listen to the information for the house, you'd let me know.
I'd love to get a place to live with a decent girl.
If you can know that, let me know.
On my part, I won't let you down.
Thank you in good time.
Hasn't texted you another man, Natalie, 54 years old. Please write down an exact address and how much the course is costing.
I think you'd better make a copy of our passports, and they have all the information.
I didn't change my name, it's one from birth :)
Mr. Reyard, I'm sorry I didn't see it, I'm gonna do it now and I'm gonna send it to you right away.
We're about to go to the medical board.
I mean, we don't have to work this hour on another day.
What day is it best for her to come early? (Mayn't on what day a bit more work?)
I'll listen to you tomorrow, the Internet is not working well.
You're lucky what you're gonna do.
Thank you... we found something out of the stuff, but there was nothing out of the technique...
Both of us start, but we don't know anything about the object.
Nothing's going on.
Can we do it on Monday 2504?
Kids can be taken with us, toys enough here :)
I'm guessing about my dad.
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'll think of something about this money.
We'll do it somehow.
But how will this be paid, please, no loans.
Text me straight, and I'll help.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know.
Shall we take with us the clothes that have been given?
It's not my day. The blinds in the living room have been broken. One morning.
Something has come from you, I can't see
I'm very sad, too.
I'll remind you of the fact later.
Is it just your dad who speaks and understands Russian?
On what day does a coworker want to clean up a house, and how much of a house has windows?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can't help but share with you.
Rajo to read to Joe Dispatch, he's doing scientific research on the impact of external factors and the formation of new neural connections.
Natalia Nagorna, a 1+1 TV reporter, released a video on April 12, in the morning, which was handed over to her by the 36th Marine Military Team from Mariopole.
In it, the military say they didn't have any weapons left to take part in the fighting, and a mountain of wounded.
They said, "the count goes for an hour."
Prior to this, April 11, 36th, a separate Marine team involved in the defence of Mariopole, published an address to the Ukrainians in the Russian language.
It was said that April 11 might be the last fight for the defenders of Mariopole, and the Ukrainian military command was not linked to the fighters for two weeks.
In the Sociétés, a skepsis was expressed that the application was published in Russian.
Chief Commander of the U.K. Armed Forces, Valery Valery, has assured us that the command of the defence forces in Mariopole is linked, and the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of a public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block U.S. fighters in the Azovstan plant in Mariopole and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russia’s occupiers dropped the poison of unknown origin on Maryupol.
As reported by the leader of Azova, Andrew Bieltski, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the Azovstal plant, which supports the fighters of the Azov regiment.
Thank you, I'm gonna fix it for you.
The situation is the same as we're still here.
Two hours of driving ) outings, mom shopping and back)!
It's not a big deal.
She forgot what she was gonna do here.
The Eskadrilia of the Czech dwarfs has now begun to fly over Ukraine.
Almost 50 professional coppers will serve to detect, and some of them will serve to directly destroy the enemy invader.
Two Zakarpatian and two Czech brothers “birds ” sent to Ukraine the previous day thanks to MP Mukachev of the city of Volodymyr Lubutenka.
Today, for their inter-Green friends, head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/exampleheare101/ Wasil Schur, delivered the drones for their assignment: they have been given special units of the Ukrainian forces in various cities, where fighting is currently taking place.
For the most efficient and safe use of coppers, we're going to keep the location of the coppers a secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop at what they have done, say that in the next few days, there will be many more interesting “gifts ” to be sent to Ukraine to serve the destruction of the Russian occupier and to save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I don't care, it's okay, I love sweet, but I can do it without it.
I'm worried we won't make it.
I'm going back to Ukraine soon, and I'm going to go to work.
Okay, if it's okay, I'll do it.
I'll try to do it myself, but if there's a mess, I'll text you, if I may?
The main thing is that we understand each other.
We were personally in the lady of old age in the village of Jonah, she saw me and that I was pregnant but she said there was no place to live.
Maybe she'll be happy and get her mood up.
I got my phone renovated today.
And I think I'm still on the street today.
I've had my meds and my tea, and I feel worse, but I'm not critical.
I'm also sorry, but I'd rather meet you when I'm well.
When you have time, send me the music you like.
I'm curious what you've got to do with music.
Mom and Dad Need to Be Obey
You'll find it somewhere near your little brother's sidecar.
It's been colder and rainier today, and it's gonna be warm tomorrow.
But it's not a pity the houses have been demolished, it's a pity the people are being bullied by the occupiers
In Herson, the occupiers were offended by the "Slave Ukraine" memorial in Herson on Perekopsky Street.
Details: It is noted that unknowns have torn the flag of the European Union, shredded the panels of the Celestial Hundreds and killed in the Russian-Ukrainian War.
The occupiers shattered images of the heroes of the Celestial Hundreds and the dead in the Russian-Ukrainian War.
The flag has been dashed.
Good morning, thanks to the kids for the cart, we don't have a custom like this, so we didn't know, we just gave the kids chocolate and cookies, maybe there was something else to give.
There's someone in Czech to talk to if you need to.
'Cause I'm kind of living in a cottage up to 12 people will be here, and then go to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
I was in the crèche today.
Even today, I've been sleeping there.
So we're making a big progress.
I'll be sure to bring the cookies another time!
I don't have the strength to do it today.
Since I'm being pushed away from the day and time when I have a job cleaning the apartments after the guests, I can say something about April of the month, because I've already got an approximation schedule for cleaning the apartments.
For the month of May, I can say about it at the end of April or at the beginning of May.
I just wanted to know if you were talking about it.
Hey, I'm so sorry I didn't write out for a long time and cooked for supper and a bit of sleep.
If you don't mind, can I come today?)
Or we'll meet after you're here.
He's been a very low-level student lately, and he's got a lot to learn.
Hey) Things went very well.
I was a bit shocked to work with people in such a high position.
Now I've got a lesson from a lady who's the head of the Economics Department of the Highlands.
She was very content with my work.
Grisko in the crèche was doing well.
On Monday, I have to bring you a job confirmation, as well as a cash bill for the crèche.
I'm on my way to Friday.
I don't do anything just a lot of them and I sleep . . (and I drink a lot of water . . . .)
If he goes to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you, if I may.
I've got to get another one.
You don't have to go again.
It's not working well, it's washing, it's not working well, it's needing a master, it's got to be set up.
So there's plenty of stuff.
Can you send me the right email address?
I'd like to send you an invitation to a course in the Czech language for which you have signed up.
And the kids are fed there, or do you have to bring them with you?
And now for a moment, you can come up with one question.
If you need any more help, write
If I'm not wrong, you're celebrating Easter tonight, right?
From the start, we didn't really want you to raise money, so people don't think we're hot on it!
But I didn't need two things to fill out online:
I'm gonna lie down for a rest, get some energy, get some energy, and thank you for today's gift.
I'm going to see the video, it's going to be good, 'cause the whole family is going to draw.
The University of Carazine calls on employees and students to check any information carefully, not trust anonymous sources in media and social media, rumours, and gossip.
You need to focus on official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in the country, is also helping the army.
I've got some work to do for the portfolio.
After the festival, we have to have an Internet.
I'd like to be your back-up designer.
How do I count the day I wasn't at work is a rendition
Staff Summary: Russia is preparing a provocation in the Transnistrian Region to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army can resort to provocations in the Predinaster Region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against the neighbouring state."
It is true that “the military forces of the Russian Federation do not exclude provocation in the Predinaster Region of the Republic of Moldova for the purpose of blaming Ukraine for aggression against the neighbouring State.”
Details: The adversary is continuing to form an opportunistic group of troops for action in the Slotian direction.
In the nearest days, the occupiers are likely to try to re-energize the attack.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, arms, and equipment to participate in combat operations in the territory of Ukraine.
Training is under way to train the Armed Forces and the Military Technicians at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th separate Motor-Signal Brigade (Monastre) of the 5th General Army of the Eastern Military Region.
It is likely that the designated arms will be moved to the temporary area of the Donetsk Region.
Also, in order to reinstate the loss of a special unit of the Battalion Tactical Team of the 36th separate Motor-Smart Brigade (Borja, Zabaikal Land), 29 General Army of the Eastern Military Region are recruiting military officers from the designated brigade.
The enemy has a particular problem with the formation of the position of drivers and driver mechanics.
The selection of the selected individual from the permanent position is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the opponent, in order to disrupt the supply of trucks to combat sites, will continue to hit the transport infrastructure in Ukraine for the purpose of destroying or derailing them.
The designated sub-units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out the task of strengthening the protection of the Ukraine-Blorco border in the Brest and Gomel oblasts.
On the Slologian side, separate sub-units of the 6th General Army and the North Fleet shores continue to block part of the city of Harkow, and continue to fire artillery shots at individual areas of the city.
In the Isosyan direction, the area is being surveyed for the purpose of locating the position of the U.S. Armed Forces.
To do this, the opponent uses an Eagle 10 drone.
Forced by two Battalion Tactical Groups, the enemy tried to make an attack in the direction of the localities of Longenke and Dimitrovk, without success, and went to pre-occupied positions.
On the Donetsk side, the main effort continues to focus on taking control of the localities of Popasna, Rubizna, Lower, and Novobakhmutka, as well as on the full control of the city of Mariopole.
The enemy was trying to carry out an attack in the Golden Zone, and it didn't work.
In the city of Mariopole, the occupiers continue to attack the Azovstan plant and the port of the sea by means of artillery and air.
The forces of individual sub-units fired artillery shots at the positions of the Ukrainian forces in the areas of Vicopill, Labor and Mariana.
In the Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts, Ukraine's backers over the past year have been bombarded by four enemy attacks, five tanks have been destroyed, eight units of armoured, six units of vehicle technology, and eight artillery systems.
Don't you get your point?
We'll usually try to catch up, but I doubt it.
How can you sleep and I'll hold you up?
You sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, so tell me, I'll get it.
We didn't watch TV at home, and we don't have to set up :)
I'm gonna turn on the TV just to listen to the language of the Czech.
I'm running out of a month-rate package today :)
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buy weave for embroidery, canvae, sewing strings
I see, I can make the material in this field.
I'm a little shy to ask, she's giving us so much pie.
I'll meet my dad later, I'll be sure to.
I've read the facebook message, so Google must have written something in his own way.
Good day, we're the things you've got, but there are things that we have little can bring you in 10 minutes?
I was thinking about the job.
If Mr. Director does, I can start work next week because I'm planning to go to the office tomorrow afternoon to get the papers (if you get very big queues) and on Saturday, it's rainy :)
I'm looking for a team at the start, very fond of chemistry at school, learning the Czech language to know perfectly, the dream of working in Tevy
Friends of old and not very well, friends I don't know personally, friends of spirit and mind.
Now you too have had a hard time.
I've been in touch with a lot of you for the last month.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned from foot to head, as has the life of every country.
A lot of you are running out of Russia.
And a lot of you have admitted to being guilty and ashamed by your country's actions vis-à-vis your neighbors.
Why they give up Ukraine in your name.
Some of you actives have been at risk for a long time, and you've been preparing for a critical blow.
In early March, I wrote Alexander Čerkasov, a very old friend of Memorial.
Let us tell you a little bit later, ” as normally said by Sacha. “ Now, after the search, we go through the ruins.
And the others, the actors of culture, the artists, the critics, the writers, are astonished by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieving and fascist, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: with the exception of a very few of you -- those who worked in the Memorial, in the New Gazette, in the Echo of Moscow, in the Medusa, in the Organisation of the National, and in a number of other places -- how many of you have done anything to resist this regime?
Apart from being part of the rallies when they're still going on.
Also read the column of a Russian journalist, "It's too late to hide, it's too late to shut up."
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Maybe they're caused by your continued indifference to what's happening around you, your apathy, and your passive co-operation, which must now have put a heavy burden on your soul and your heart?
It wasn't always like that.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you enjoyed to a certain extent freedom and democracy – a messy, even bloodthirsty, but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why, every time you finally have a revolution, do you finally have such a strong fear of sadness that you're looking for salvation behind the king's back, may his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think he's safer.
In fact, mistakes have been made.
Instead of grabbing and publishing the KGB Archives, as the Germans in the Stage did, you took your soul to the Duzerinski Monument – and let the KGB lie down, refresh, reform, and take over the country.
When you were put to a choice between the country’s looting and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for a third option – and humbly put up with theft.
In 1998 your economy fell, and it marked the end of mass rallies for big social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
And then there was Putin, young, businessly, aggressive, and he promised to deal with the terrorists and raise the economy.
Not many of you fell for it, but you either voted for it or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to match the Chechen with the land again, most of you blindfolded.
I remember well those years.
I was working in Chechen at the time, helping the victims of the Putinian "antiteroric operation," and I saw with my eyes the ruins of the Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on the weekends, I went back to Moscow and was having fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We've been drinking, dancing, and sometimes I've been trying to tell you about the horrors I've been witnessing, the tortures of peaceful people, the killing of children, the soldiers who sold the bodies to their families.
You said to me, "Oh, shit, we're sick of your Chestnut." I remember that very well.
In response, I resented, "Friends, it's not my Chechen, it's your Chechen.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It's your authority that bombes one of your cities, kills your countrymen."
But no, it was all too hard, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic upturn in the middle of zero, due to the rising prices of oil and the readyness of Putin to look through his toes at the fact that some of the stolen money will stay in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have made a good living, some have been rich, and even the poorest of you have bought a new home and found a better job.
The price's up, but what's wrong?
Moscow was shining and shining from the neck.
When a number of opponents were killed – Yuri Zekichin, Anna Politsky, Alexander Litwinenka, and others – many of you were shocked and expressed terror about what was going on.
But it was not the case.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of President Medvedev and sat down as the prime minister, I see you're barely paying attention to it.
When Medvedev Russia invaded Georgia after a few months of rule, most of you ignored it or conspired.
How many of you have I met in the next years on the Goodauri Hills, in the outskirts of Gozbeg, or in the cafeterias and in the Tbilis Turks, while a part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit, I don't think we've done much in the West, if we've done anything at all.
A bit of resentment, a bit of sancing; but what was the point of Russia’s outright violation of international law when such a big temptation of Russian oil, gas, and the domestic market?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the hard 1990s, it was the main thing.
But at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still wake up.
When Putin again traded places with Medvedev and sat down the presidential chair, as before, a lot of you decided it was too much, and you massively protested.
The name of Navalny became a pronoun, you didn't go out of the street for half a year, and the regime finally felt horrified that it was losing the ground under its feet.
Afterwards, he struck back.
Initially, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and the prisons were filled with people.
Thousands are behind bars.
Some have been given immense terms.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often, and I still hear it.
"The strong is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Disturbed by the pro-Russia president, who fooled their European expectations, they once seized Maydan – and never left.
They built a tent city on their own, and they prepared for strong defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, fittings, and Molotov cocktails.
The police finally opened fire.
But instead of running, the protesters went into attack.
A lot of people died, but they won.
The runner was Janukowitsch, and the Ukrainians restored their democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and to banish them if they are not doing their job well.
Maydan was very disliked by Putin.
That was a bad example.
So, using the general confusion, he conquered the Krem.
Some of you have been against it, but there is little to do with it.
How many of you have been fascinated!
As far as I know, 91% of Russia's citizens supported anecdotes.
Out of here, a new myth was born, and a lot of you, who hated Putin and his gang, all of a sudden went back 180 degrees and adored it.
I find it hard to find a reason, because right after that, we stopped talking.
The rest of my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you hid new in the books, the movie, the IKEA catalogs, and the parks, as new after the restoration, which was started by Moscow in 2012 – with their bingoes, the common Vifay and the Hipster Café.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's just getting better.
You've drawn close attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, weren't there?
IDILE or whatever... even the Moscow editor who released my book on Syria, he criticized it in an interview, because I didn't really know what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I was on my way up there, and I saw the State sniper shoot in the streets of Homs in cold blood at my kids' age.
Of all the citizens of Russia, there were only your soldiers, who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of pastor Martin Niemeller:
"At first, they came on socialists, but I was silent, 'cause I'm not a socialist.
Then they came to the tradesmen, but I was silent, because I'm not a tradesman.
Then they came after the Jews, but I spoke silently, for I am not a Jew.
"Then they came after me, but there was no one left to say anything to protect me."
How many of you have been talking about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you have.
But the vast majority of them spoke.
Some are actually talking now – such as Dmitro Glaukhovsky, Mikhailo Shishkin, Michael Zigar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most people are able to talk from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovalnikov, risking getting into the new GUALS or putting up a company called Navalny.
As for others, you know best where you live.
So, I'm sure you understand, when Putin's dealing with the Ukrainians -- or, what seems very likely, if he doesn't, he'll do it for you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who bravely, but mostly alone, have protested, and have so far been a small term, but will soon be more serious.
For thousands of you who have signed petitions, who have expressed dissent in social media (let's have a black square in Instagram) or who have spoken in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of disfellowshipping were just for anecdotes have not been so far past – and now they are very likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you, who will be left?
The example of the Ukrainians – even more than 2014 – frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it can be combated.
And that mind, motivation, and bravery can stop it, no matter how depressing it might be on the paper.
In view of everything, few in Russia are aware of this, as is the fact that war is going on.
But you, my friends, know exactly what's going on.
You read news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine you're in touch with.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You know what this is all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just funny, your laws, if you don't mind the oppressive, cost no more than the paper on which they're written, your last free media are no longer, your economy is going down faster than I am writing, you don't have credit cards to buy a plane card out of the country, even if there are still some flights left.
Now Putin won't be content with your silence, he'll be demanding your consent, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try to go or you get crushed.
I don't think you can see another option.
Still, there's still one.
Which will eventually bring down this regime.
And maybe under the conditions you're in, you're gonna need less than you think.
Think about it.
It's not from you: because of the economic collapse in Russia, it's likely to burn up in the province, in small cities.
When the prices go up and the wages don't go up, those people who have been voting for Putin for all these years, wanting bread and peace, will go out on the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people far more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, or you, my friends.
But if every city goes to a meeting by itself, as has been the case from time to time, it won't be hard for it to stifle them alone.
We're going to need an organization and a coordination. We're going to have to turn the crowd into a mass.
You have this wonderful magical tool -- an Internet that can limit the mode, but that still works, and that can be set up under almost any circumstances.
The Naval organization has been shattered, but we can create other, more informal, more decentralized.
You're a lot, you're a million.
The Moscow Police can deal with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly with a hundred thousand.
If it's over 300,000, it'll be astonished.
We're gonna have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to it?
After all he made them go to Ukraine, all he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will have a sense of fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid if I were you.
In the case of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happened to those who dared to ignore their master, who dared not only to demand freedom, but was really trying to get it.
But even if you don't do anything, the lives of countless people will still be for nothing.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat game – and he will be arrested; your daughter will express resentment on the Internet – and he will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake – and die in a grey cell under a police baton.
That's what's been going on for years – and it's just gonna get worse, getting bigger and bigger.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know what's gonna happen.
Do it in a cold-blooded way, think strategicly, and make it a reality.
We've been in class Friday, we've been told we can come on Monday.
We'll be home tonight.
That you see me as the press of the secretary
Wow, how often do you go to a fancy restaurant for supper?
Once on my mouth, I go to dinner at a fancy restaurant.
I'll try to explain it to her.)
So we liked a very good one and we wanted something brighter so it's a better option.
I was in a room where there were a lot of people.
I don't feel well, coughing, fever, voice, weakness, and head spinning
I have to go to that government of work
We've already done it, but they say who's registered in April half the money only at the end of the month.
On Thursday, we have to re-enter, go with the kids to the doctor.
But at night, I was texted by a lady who liked your work, and she would want something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for new news from her, and I'm gonna give you a message.
As a prokurator, I thought I was going to be a career, I wasted a lot of time and energy.
I had a hard, responsible, mental job in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a pity to lose time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am a communist, but I am serious about love and marriage.
There was a man I had to marry, but he died, a heart problem.
I think people have to love, respect, trust each other to form a family.
Now, I don't know what I've seen.
Good day, where can you get a form to bake a bag (papper or silicon) in Jewel?
Okay, thanks for the tip, then I'm going to put a statement on Valya.
She's got a DCP in her bed, now she's got a broken leg in her hips, a wheelchair in her bed, all the food is shredded in a blender
Mr. Reyhardt, I'm sorry I'm bothering you at a casual time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to Natalie's playroom today, to say hi to her.
She was in a bad situation.
Because when the kids went home, one mom refused to take the kid, because she said she'd come to see things and put them in that room with the clothes and Mr. Valery yesterday opened up our child's room by 7:00.
Can it really be?
It's working time for the room at 4:00.
And eventually, it's our responsibility.
But I don't have to load it. It doesn't open a very weak Internet.
Good day, we're all right.
It's the hardest thing to do with geometry.
On Saturday, Wladimir helped us.
Age is a student of high school universities and programs.
Can we pay for the flat and wf?
We are very grateful for the shelter
Yeah, but I thought you didn't fill it out.
We're gonna try to make the most of the sum by the end of the week to be able to count.
The Russian Invasion Situation - Brifing the Head of the Office of President Alexius Aresovic (10.04.2022)
The head of the office of the President spoke of the heroic action of the senior officer of the military in Mariopole -- he was surrounded and injured, so he blew himself up with the radio station so she wouldn't get to the opponent.
I have a very important question, if you can help me count my grandson her five years old (bronchial asthma) now she's sniffing and whining...
We need a family doctor for her to understand a bit of Ukrainian or Russian.
The doctor’s advice is critical to her condition....
We live in the Czech Dorní Chabry. We need a doctor who's here in the Dolní Chabry or somewhere near, maybe Brno, but not far from the subway so we can get there.
The butterfly exhibition was very enjoyable.
The butterflies sat on their hands and feet.
How's your day?
Oh, my God, it's so cool, I'm so grateful, I'm not, I'm so thank you.
Mom's been there from 4:00 a.m.
Perhaps the mistress will leave her phone for communication.
So far, I think it's the best option for this place in Paris eight.
The director didn't tell me anything about the possibility of sponsoring a baby lunch.
Give me the data to pay for it.
For part of March and for April, I have already paid for food.
If you could help me pay for May and June?
What do I have to do?
Go to the headmaster on this matter?
Walk on Mondays, or do you want to come on Wednesday?,!,/
All your friends will know you're in touch with me.
I don't know what I'm gonna do about what my house needs soon and there's no place to live
Were you the first to get out of a relationship or was you left behind?

I was a manicurist, and a friend of the manager.
But we know everything, we're Ukraine, and what we can't do, we learn fast.)
I want you to find a good helper.
I've been thinking it's been a while.
Can I ask you to take me as you go home?
I need a nightstand, I can pay the rent.
I don't know what to do.
We need to go to the embassy from time to time, I'm waiting to be able to rework the files, I'm going to ask. I'm gonna look here again.
And I'm curious to talk to you.
