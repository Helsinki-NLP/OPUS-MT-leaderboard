But first of all, I think we need to add to the component of unity.
In my view, we have a problem with it.
The Kremlin supports the ban on smoking on the balconies of homes
The Kremlin supports any action that will save lives, as President Dmitry Pescow's Spokesman commented on the ban on smoking on the balconies and locomotives of apartments.
In the past, Kabmin has approved changes to the Fire Regulations, which prohibit the use of open fire on the balconies and the rooms of the homes.
Later, the Russian MES reported that this included a ban on smoking on the balconies and lounges of apartments and hotels.
The changes will take effect on 1 October 2019.
The breach is subject to administrative liability.
The Kremlin has a positive view of any decision that saves human life.
"We know how many fires there are, many of them have very tragic consequences and public resonance.
So any life saved justifies such a decision," said Sandov.
First of all, the Spokesman views this as a fire-fighting measure, not a way to protect his neighbors from tobacco smoke.
Peskov also noted that Russia’s President, Wladimir Putin, does not welcome smoking and is a supporter of a healthy way of life.

China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of a “Tai Bay Bill”
China strongly opposes the adoption by the US of the so-called “Tai Bay Bill”, which is in grave breach of the one-China principle and the three Chinese-American Joint Communiqués.
This was announced on Friday by the official representative of the State Council for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan.
The approval by the United States Senate Committee on International Relations of the bill is also a serious violation of international law and fundamental principles of international relations and a gross interference in China ' s internal affairs, noted Ma Xiaoguan.
Taiwan, he said, was part of China, and the issues involved related to China ' s internal affairs.
“We call on the American side to clarify the situation, to stop immediately moving on the relevant negative bills, and to immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan question in order to avoid further harm to China-American relations, as well as to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” he noted.
China must and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be halted by any and all means, as Ma Xiaoguan stressed.
TikTok Hide Bad Videos from Users
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world is over 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
Imagine China/Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok censored a video that mentions Tiananmen Square, Tibet's independence, or Falun Gong's banned religious group, says The Guardian.
The paper states that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) is an app that promotes China's foreign policy objectives abroad.
Most of China's policy-related violations fall under the “inflammation of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok puts unfavorable publications in a context that fits the general rules so that the actions of the social network do not look like censoring.
For example, the ban on criticism of China's socialist system falls under a general ban on “criticizing or attacking the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the “probation of the history of China or other countries”.
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of the 20 “foreign leaders or statesmen”, including the North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sen and Kim Jong Eun, the Indian policy of Mahatmu Gandhi, the American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, the Japanese Premier Sinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Kyung Hee, the Indonesian President Joko Vidodo and Indian Premier Narendra Modi, listed in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by social media administrators and may result in the user locking up.
The second category is not too strict: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is restricted to the TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are obsolete and no longer applied: "We are now using a localized approach to the modernization, as well as engaging independent local experts."
The Russian users of TikTok do not have specific restrictions on the publication, as the co-founder of the "Producing Center" by Rustham Bogdanov.
The "Producer's Center" is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All blogging material, The Productive Center, is in touch with the social media, but the user material can be posted unharmonized, handing over the Bogdans.
Asking if TikTok can talk about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answers yes and says he's seen such publications.
The founder of Our Digital, Roman Zaripov, agrees with Bogdanov: "The basic rules for users of TikTok list in the user agreement: you cannot post shocking content, discriminating remarks, etc. ".
But under these rules, you can give up any content that the Monitors don't like, notes Zaripov.
Zaripova is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world is over 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
By user agreement, only persons over the age of 13 can use TikTok.
The social media administrators test their age with artificial intelligence: neurosensing faces, and determining how many years a person looks, tells Bogdanov.
If the neurose decides that the user is younger, the account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBK, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow in September 2019 on the territory of WeWork.
The people of Istanbul spoke of an earthquake in the city
A massive earthquake has caused a panic in the largest city of Turkey
Last Thursday, 26 September, an earthquake of 5.9 magnitude in Istanbul erupted in Istanbul.
A total of 34 people have been injured, 10 of whom are still in hospitals.
A resident of Istanbul, Melika, confessed to having had a panic attack for the first time in her life.
"I cried so much.
She was crying right on the job.
Afterwards, I got back to business.
But I'm so ashamed right now!" the girl told TV channel 360.
"In Istanbul, there was a real big earthquake.
I can't go back until now!
But in general, I'm fine" - shared his impressions with politician Jalan Ozgül.
The project manager, Celine, noted that the mayor of the city kept everyone up to date, but, according to her, the city still felt a small push of about 3.2 or 3.5.
She also drew attention to the problem of communications in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake.
She told me she couldn't reach her mother, but the Internet was "excellent" and she was able to send a message via WhatsApp.
As Kp.ru wrote, after the earthquake, all the kindergartens and schools from which all the students were evacuated were closed.
473 buildings have been damaged.

I don't think anything's been wrong in our relationship.
In Roshrovnadzor, the results of the amputation test were reported to the child.
A child in Rostov oblast was amputated because of a miscarriage of doctors, reports "Look" with a link to the site of the Rostov observatory.
An 11-year-old boy broke his arm, and he was given a gips at the Zernograd District Hospital.
After a while, the child developed gangrene and was amputated.
The audit found that there was a lack of timeliness and correctness of the diagnosis, as well as of the standard and the amount of assistance provided.
The verification material has been transferred to the Russian SC SN for the region.
URA.RU had previously reported that the head of the Southern Gorge Hospital had been arrested.
The Russians have been warned of false bank calls.
In Russia, there has been an increase in the number of calls from cons who replace the bank's phone number.
This is reported by Commersant with a reference to Central Bank data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator handed over to the telecommunications operators information on more than 2,500 numbers from which the clients of the various financial organizations had been called.
In 189 cases, the operators found a change of number.
An additional 218 numbers have been blocked, and in 59 cases a limit has been placed on the use of financial services.
The Deputy Head of the Information Security Department of the CSS, Artem Sychev, said that a wide range of Russian banks had met with the change of number.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank's warnings of fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such a duty in the Liaison Act.
The Open Bank, Rosbanke and the Alpha Bank confirmed an increase in the number of fraudulent phone calls.
According to the Bilaya press, part of the information on the fraudulent calls that was sent to the CB was incorrect: the lists included numbers that were actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would have led to a failure in the work of the organization.
Artem Sychev told us that Centralobanc is planning to set up a crooked number base, to which the telecommunications operator will turn at each call to check the number.
He explained that such a base would require legislative amendments.

According to the agency, this was the case during the Russian election on 8 September.

In the view of the staff, it was bound by the laws of the country.

Stoltenberg discussed Ukraine ' s green accession to NATO
The Secretary-General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, and the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, discussed Ukraine's membership in an alliance on the margins of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly.
The gensec spoke about this at Columbia University in New York.
In response to a question as to whether the subject was raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they had indeed discussed the issue, and he also stressed that he had not mentioned the date of Ukraine ' s joining NATO.
He said that any country that wanted to join the North Atlantic Alliance was bound to meet certain conditions to meet specific standards, RT writes.
In Crimea, the Green Alternative to the NATO course was offered
The President of Ukraine, Wladimir Zelenski, should instead of joining NATO, work to establish good-neighbourly relations with Russia.
This was reported on Friday, 27 September, by the Co-President of the Assembly of the Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea, Roman Čegrinets.
"Mr. the President of Ukraine does not have to repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but should heed the advice of [the President of the United States] Donald Trump, who he listened to with a sour face, and to establish a relationship with the President of Russia," said the Chegrin to the journalists "RIA News."
The Chegrin noted that Zelenski was a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, it was only if relations with the Russian Federation were established that the Ukrainian President would be able to remain in power.
Earlier on September 27, the NATO Gensec Jens Stoltenberg reported that he had an interview with Zelenski on the country's joining the alliance.
To that end, he said, Ukraine was obliged to meet certain conditions.
On 5 June, the deputy was pleased to say to Yevgeny Bálicki that Ukraine ' s possible joining the alliance did not guarantee a better life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
"Barcelona" is blackmailing Naymar.
The Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer, Neimar, are trying to settle the financial dispute that erupted after the attacker's transfer to the French Paris St. Germain.
The case was about to go to court, but the Catalans offered the player to settle the dispute without the intervention of the Femids.
Otherwise, they refuse to return.
Naymar and his clever father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, had an interesting focus: by an agreement with the Barza, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million Euros.
However, just a year later, he was in the SGW for a record 222 million euro.
Still, he got 22 million from the Catalons and now he wants to take the rest of the 18.
In fact, the Brazilian jurists insist that the club owes him interest on the late payment.
When Neymar's claims were reported in the capital city of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counter-claim.
The Blue Granate insists that the bonus was based on the full contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club is of the opinion that the player was only a quarter of the 40 million euro and that he is required to return the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer, Naymar and Bursa almost agreed to return the "foolish" player to the loins of Catalonia.
True, the deal has failed, but the hope for a forward return is still in place.
And so, according to Sports.Ru, with reference to insiders, the club's lawyers told the player that if the issue of financial claims was not resolved in the pre-trial manner, it would rule out the possibility of a Brazilian's return.
Naymar himself is so willing to return, he has asked for assurances that the Catalans will buy it back.

But Laar replied that the aim of the Reform Party was to get two seats on the Bank of Estonia council, so that, in addition to Yaanus Tamkivi, Andres Suttt would be on the council.
On Tuesday, 24 September, the Riigikogu rejected Laar's offer to appoint new members of the Bank of Estonia.

Which club will take Paul Mamaev's paroleed
Football player Pavel Mamaev, who was released from parole last week, will not return to a club called "Crasnodar."
The former quarterback of this club is in a position to sign a contract with the FC Rostov soon, reports the Championate Portal.
According to the publication, the talks between Rostova and Mamajev are now in the final stage.
A contract with a 31-year-old footballer is expected to be signed for two years, with the possibility of an extension for another season.
"Sport Express" writes that the day before, Pavel Mamayev was to undergo a medical examination at the Moscow Dinamo, but the test was not done due to the "undefined situation in the club."
The Krasnodar terminated the contract with Mamaev last week by agreement of the parties.
The half-defendant has been playing for the Reddress Club since 2014.
With the team, he won the bronze of Russia's championship on two occasions.
In the past, Mamayev was in favour of the Moscow "Torpedo" and the CSCA.
From 2009 to 2016, Mamaev played for Russia with 15 matches.
He was sentenced, together with the player "Zenita" Alexander Cocorin Mamayev, for taking part in a fight in the center of Moscow last October.
In mid-September, they were released from parole.

A man with a samurai sword tried to resist a cart found in a dumpster.
A resident of the U.S. city of Auckland Park, Florida, was arrested for attempted murder after samurai swung his opponent in an argument over a cart found in the trash.
54-year-old Curtis Miller was digging in a pile of trash near an empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers, who was on an evening hike.
The last one decided to join the search and found a black cart among the trash.
Miller saw Beavers' find, and he got upset.
He thought he could claim a cart because he was the first one to dig in the trash.
The men began to argue.
All of a sudden Bivers grabbed the cart and ran with it towards his home.
So Miller took the same samurai sword he found in the same pile and chased the opponent.
He chased Bivers down by his house.
Miller took the sword out of the knife and started waving it in the direction of the cart kidnapper.
Beavers told Miller that this was on video.
After seeing the video camera, Miller ran away, but he threatened to return.
Bivers left the cart in the backyard and went into the house.
Shortly afterward, he saw an unknown woman come to his courtyard and pick up the cart, yelling at him.
The police have already been looking for Miller for driving an unlicensed car.
The man was arrested, charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the United States city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked an unknown woman and wounded her with a sword.
He thus reacted to the fact that the guests at the wedding, which was celebrated at the same hotel where he was staying, had not given him a light.
Massive riots at three
The “Moscow case” against the participants in the summer protests goes on, the more noticeable the fragments fall apart and lose political content.
Proof of the very fact of the “mass disturbances” does not stand the test, but in the absence of a political decision to bring the case to a standstill, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the drop of the charges.
The break-up of a case should inspire the community, but it is certain that it will leave in extreme anger the stewards, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have been in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining in the case under article 212 of the PC (mass disturbances) - Alexei Minyalo was suddenly released without any obligation, and after a few hours and completely rehabilitated, the SCR dropped the charges.
Minylo was under arrest for almost two months, and was supported by a number of professional associations: historians, priests, and literators.
Since then, there have been only two indictees (initially 13): Sergey Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on 3 September, and Samaridin Rajabov, who was arrested on the previous day by the court until the end of December (he is also charged with the use of violence against a representative of the authority, art. 318 of the Criminal Code).
The court sentenced the author of the joke petition to join the United States of America
The Videm suburb court in Riga sentenced the author of a joke petition for Latvia to join the United States of America, Denis Bartezki.
It is noted that the man was assigned 80 hours of correctional work and one year of probation.
"The common sense is not the most powerful part of our system," commented the Bartez court decision.
He also added that usually the punishment is less than the request.
The collection of Latvia's accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
In the meantime, in parallel with this petition, the site collected signatures on Latvia's accession to the “Galaxic Empire” and on the country's exit from the solar system and the Milky Way.
It is noted that a criminal case has been brought against Bartezki under the first paragraph of article 82 of the country's Criminal Law, “a public call to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia”.
Prior to this, in 2016, the author of the Internet Petition to join Latvia in Russia received a six-month prison.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to punish police officers for insulting them on the Internet.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia has prepared amendments to the Police Act to protect the security guards from the dissemination of slanderous and dishonoring information on the Internet.
On Friday, an application for public discussion of the bill was made on the federal legal instrument portal, and the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The Explanatory Note to the paper states that it is being developed in response to the need to protect the honour and dignity of a police officer from “sharing in information and communication networks, including on the Internet”, defamatory information, including discrediting information.
The exact way in which police officers are to be protected from libel on the Internet is not specified.
In this connection, it is stated in the explanation of the document that the provisions of the amendments will be applied “by the individualization of the mechanism”, the Act on the freezing of posts that offend the authorities, and the Act on fines for such posts.
Both Acts entered into force in March this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public discussion and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the Explanatory Note, the amendments to the Police Act are to enter into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Wladimir Poetin signed a law to punish “exclusive contempt of the State” on the Internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor warns the resource of a violation and gives it 24 hours to deal with it.
For the first violation of the prohibitions, a fine of 30 to 300,000 roubles is provided for, and for the second violation, an administrative arrest for up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roscomnadzor first applied this rule to the media, blocking the Yaroslav edition.
Shortly thereafter, the Novgorod Region District Court fined the local resident 30,000 roubles for posting on the network “two records of indecent information that offends human dignity and public morals and manifests a clear disrespect for society, the State, the authorities that exercise public authority in the Russian Federation”.

The rate of housing loans in Russia will fall by the end of 2019.
Alexander Plutnik, Director-General of the Dom.F Credit Organisation, has said so, handing it over to Interfax.
As Plutnik on the board of the Ministry of the Russian Federation has noted, most banks will run another round of mortgage cuts in the remaining months of the year, and the market average will reach 8.9 per cent, the level set out in the national project “Living and the City Environment”.
According to the project, in 2019, the average rate on the mortgage should be 8.9 per cent, in 2021, 8.5 per cent, and in 2024, 7.9 per cent.
The programme provides for “the provision of affordable housing for middle-income families, including the creation of opportunities to purchase (the construction of a mortgage with a rate of less than 8 per cent)”.
Previously, in September, it was reported that one of the major players in the Russian mortgage market, Sberbank, was planning to make another reduction in the housing rate by the end of 2019.
Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help to prolong their youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens has not been studied very well.
Of the most famous are pine pollen.
The phyto estrogens, on the other hand, are well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (such as cardiovascular, some types of cancer).
A well-known source of phyto estrogens is all beans (the most popular soybean), heaps, leenseeds.
In fact, many experts believe that such beads cannot be a full - time substitute for natural hormones.
The possible harm from such additives cannot be ruled out.
For example, the production of their own hormones can be reduced by the fact that there are too many external analogues in the body.
Vertennikov was called upon to resurrect the Kazakh Jenis.

He's got a big story and great fans.
I wish them all the best, and I believe that the city's authorities will return to their home club!", Wrote Vertennikov at Instagram.

The hydromethod center called the right people's traits
There are many people in Russia who try to predict the weather.
Sadly, not all of them work.
The Hydromethod Center has checked all the signs that are supposed to work.
Meteorologists have come to the conclusion that only two of them can be truly trusted, though, in a short-term period of time.
As the Russian Hydromethod Center's scientific head, Roman Wilfund, has said, if the sun is red during the setting, the next day will indeed be a good day, as our ancestors have marked.
And if the sky was white, it would be raining the next day.
The second working sign is based on bird-watching.
They talk more about swabs, and if they fly low, it's usually in the rain.
It's simple - when the air's soaking, the moths are wetting their wings, and the feathers have to drop to hunt insects, writes the TASS.
There are people on different continents.
Sour Day is a traditional popular holiday in the United States and Canada, which is celebrated on February 2 every year.

Unidentified oil stains are found on the beaches of North-east Brazil
Oil stains of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches in north-east Brazil.
The contaminants have been scattered 2,000 km of the shoreline.
Reports of the first oil slicks found began on September 2.
However, their number continued to grow from day to day until Thursday, as did their territorial coverage.
The Brazilian Institute for the Environment carried out a chemical analysis of the samples.
It turns out they're all the same, and it's about raw oil.
In the State Oil Corporation, Petrobras, which was sent for the analysis of the specimens found, stated that they were not in line with the oil extracted from the fields on Brazilian soil.
"This is dense oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after the tanks have been cleaned.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it hit the ocean current," told the Brazilian news portal G1, the coordinator of the Union of Oil Workers of the States of Pernambuco and Paraiba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that, despite the ban on this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches, four of the eight affected states in the north-east of the country, environmentalists found nine sea turtles full of oil.
And only two of them have been saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute for the Environment, together with Petrobras, will begin to clean up the polluted beaches.
In the meantime, the Institute advises tourists and locals to bypass the oil stains and report all the spots found.

Russia has nothing to spare - V. Matvienko
The Speaker of the Valentine's Federation Council, Matvienko, is of the view that the Russians do not have enough savings to make the National Pension Guaranteed Product Bill work.
The practice of increasing the pension from personal savings is common in the world.
It's another matter, how timely we have it.
"In my view, a large part of the population now has incomes, of which they simply have nothing to spend to increase pension in the future," said V. Matvienko.
The Russians, in the view of the Speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms for the formation and calculation of a pension, as “the constant changes in this field have made them completely confused”.
That doesn't mean I'm against the improvement of the pension system that governs its legislation.
“Russia is a social State, and we have to do everything we can to make sure that the size of pensions, the social security of citizens, is improved.
But the steps in this direction need to be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account national realities,” said V. Matthienko, “RIA News.
The head of the SF stressed that if the initiative (the Pension Product Guarantee Bill) was to be developed, there must be a number of basic principles, including voluntaryness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict State guarantees and responsibilities for the security of pension savings.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced that a bill on the guaranteed pension product (PPP) would be sent for negotiation.
The main elements of the scheme include the exclusive voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, the guarantee of the security of long-term national pension savings by the State, the registration of citizens ' savings accounts by the central administrator, tax incentives for business and tax deductions for citizens.

The expert explained why we should give up the tea in the packets.
A group of Canadian scientists from the University of McGill found that in five minutes more than 10 billion microplastic particles are ingested in a cup of tea.
An expert in food security, Elizabeth Tikinonov, said, can also add sawdust particles to the packaged drink.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain accurate information on the composition of the packaged tea - the producer can add ingredients that will not be included on the package.
The sawdusts don't go out at the end of the season, so they might end up in tea.
"More than that, the packets don't always include tea plants," said Tikhonov.
She said that it would be best to give up the use of such a cup of tea for the spike, which is sold in specialized shops.
She also stressed that the risk of packaged tea lies not only in the composition but also in the way it is produced - the microparticles are heated to high temperatures, so that they can start to release harmful substances.
"The best way to get a clean green or black tea is to have the least extra in it," the expert said.

It's time to build cross-regional links
The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy compiled information from the regions on their business development and legalization programmes for self-employed persons, as well as on the outcomes of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions shared with the senators the problems of the development of SMEs and put forward proposals for the improvement of existing legislation.
“To date, there has been a lack of regional communication, which has led to a lack of information on regional business development programmes throughout the country by the business community in all the regions of the senatorial visit,” said Andrei Kutepov.
In an annex to the letter to the Government, he presented a set of positive regional developments in the legalization of self-employment and a summary of the proposals and issues from the regions (available in the revision).
In addition to the relevant ministries, a summary of data from the regions has also been sent to the heads of the regional executive.
The exchange of information on positive developments in the regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship in general.
The first step in such an exchange would be to send the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy," said the senator in the "Parliamentary Gazette".
Useful experience
Programmes to support small- and medium-sized business are now in place and are operating successfully in many regions of the country.

In Ivanov oblast, a business support system has been developed to implement the one-window principle through multifunctional centres.
In Krasnodar province, new agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants from the country ' s budget.

In a number of other regions, special support measures for youth entrepreneurship have been put in place.
Self-employed keep getting out of the shadows.
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of legislative changes should be made to support small and medium-sized business more effectively.
For example, the archangelic region has proposed to replace the term “self-employment” with “entrepreneurial activity”, as it is “most in line with the content of the public service to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In Ivanovsk oblast, it is considered necessary to make amendments to expand the list of activities of self-employed citizens, including activities for the repair and repair of accommodations, day-to-day construction and physical training.
The Brian Region considers it important to strengthen the control of malpractice dairy producers through the Mercury Veterinary System.
And in the oblasts of Kostrom and Magadan, there is a call for the concept of social entrepreneurship and support for social entrepreneurship in the legal and legal field.
All regional proposals will be taken into account in the preparation of State support programmes for small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State support programmes for small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills”, assured by Andrey Kutepov.
The airline has helped the passengers to avoid having to live with the weeping children
The Japan Airlines (JAL) air carrier has a new function: when the aircraft is booked, you can now find out where the little kids will be.
Now, if you want to live with them, you can avoid them.
The Japan Airlines (JAL) has been able to use the new option to avoid wanting neighborhoods with small children.
The air carrier has run a function that can track where the kids will be seated.
With the choice of seating positions in the lounge, passengers will be able to see a picture of the child ' s head in the field, which is occupied by children between eight days and two years of age.
So those who don't want to fly next to the kids because of the possible inconvenience of their weeping can get as far away from them as possible.
The Internet users who use the services of the airline are fascinated by the innovation.
Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One of the users complained that he was flying from New York to Doha a few weeks ago, and there were three weeping children next to him.
Another commentator suggested the introduction of “adult-only flights”, expressing a willingness to pay for such a flight.
Many tourists have noted that they will now try to always choose to move Japan Airlines, as they see no pleasure in flying next to a crying child in a closed space.
Previously, a woman who was traveling with a baby tried to cheer up her travelers on the Seoul-San Francisco flight.
She made a bag of sweets for each of the 200 passengers, each containing an apology note.

On the wall of the wagons, you can see rare archival images and images from the movies.

To participate in a single picket in solidarity with the actor on September 18, a queue was set up on the Old Square.

According to Interfax, Sister Ustinov Julia, her brother has no plans to speak at a meeting in the capital on 29 September in support of the “Moscow business”.
The “sanctions” to Russia have fallen 100 times.
In the Government of the Russian Federation, the supply of agricultural and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo has been estimated to have decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31,000 tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries, as compared to 3 million 442.2000 tons in the same period in 2013, Interfax reports.
The value of imported products has fallen to $226.5 million from $4,975.5 million, respectively.
This is the supply of non-embargo items.
As indicated in the report, the volume of prohibited imports was offset by an increase in imports from the CIS, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
Let us recall that at the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are not allowed to enter Russia by means of counter-sanctions.
The document on the official legal information portal stated that the rules had been extended for one more year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
Originally, the destruction order applied to products from the US, EU, Australia, Norway, and Canada.
Later, on August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Ukraine joined the list on January 1, 2016.
A decree on the destruction of illegal “sanctions” (the food embargo products that Moscow has imposed in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) was signed by Putin and entered into force in 2015.
The Government, in turn, has authorized the destruction of “sanctionary” food by any legal means.
As Western sanctions continued, the Russian Federation also extended its response.
This measure does not apply to products imported by citizens for their personal use.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption of up to 5 kg.
However, the head of the Council of the President of the Russian Federation for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, had earlier described the “simplely immoral” destruction of food, which he said had a negative effect on the upbringing of people.
In fact, Rospresnadzor launched an initiative to prohibit the destruction of food suitable for use in early June.
A similar recommendation was then made to the Government by the Human Rights Council of the President of the Russian Federation.
And the vice-premier of the Russian Federation, Alexei Gordeyev, said that it was wrong to destroy food, and we have to think about how to use it for the purpose of quality.

In Chile, a 1-billion-dollar telescoop was started.
This is reported by TASS with a reference to the European Southern Observatory (ESO) press service.
This week, the European Extreme Large Telescope, the most expensive and ambitious Earth-based astronomical project, has been officially launched, according to ESO.
The total cost is estimated to be over a billion euro.
Most of this money will be spent on the construction of equipment and the building of the observatory.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescoop is a record-sized mirror with a diameter of about 39 meters.
It will be collected from 798 hexagonal segments of 1.4 meters.
It's a massive mirror, and it's two support surface-reflectors with a diameter of 4,2 and 3.75 meters, which will help E-ELT get the first detailed images of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and search for the Earth's doppelgangers.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the dome has just begun to be built, the mirrors, scientific instruments, and other components of the observatory have been developed by scientists, engineers, and others for three years since the first E-ELT plans were announced.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, the total value of which was about 400 million euro, was awarded to the German firm SCHOTT and to the French company Safran Reosc.
