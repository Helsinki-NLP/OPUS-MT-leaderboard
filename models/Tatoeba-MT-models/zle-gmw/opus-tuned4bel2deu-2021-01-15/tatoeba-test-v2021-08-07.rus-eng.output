Whites: a1, pion on b6, king on c8. Blacks: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, elephant on b8. Whites place a rival in the position of a tsuckwang, setting a tong on a6, and then blacks have two options: to take a torch on a6 or to move an Elephant to any other field of diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, whites move a pawn from b6 to b7 and put a mat. In the second case a white torch picks up a black pawn on a7 with the same result.
