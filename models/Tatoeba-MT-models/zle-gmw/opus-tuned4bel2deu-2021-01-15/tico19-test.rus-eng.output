The coronavirus (COVID-19) is a rapidly growing colonized disease in the European Union and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
Communicable coronavirus (COVID-19) has similar trends in the EU/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, thus confirming that, despite the different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is on the rise in all countries.
Taking into account Italy ' s experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to increase the level of preparedness for COVID-19 patients who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown ethos in Hubei, China, were reported.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the new type of coronavirus, now known as the coronavirus of Type 2 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), was the source of the infection.
Since then, SARS-COV-2 has become known as coronavirus (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, about 80% of people with COVID-19 have an lung disease, i.e. an airway infection with or without pneumonia, with most of the patients recovering.
In about 14% of the cases COVID-19 is developing into a more severe form of hospitalization, while in the rest 6% is in a critical form when intensive treatment is needed.
The mortality rate for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is about 4%.
The study examines the trends in COVID-19 co-alignment in each country of the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in the United Kingdom, and compares them with those in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom with data for Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is currently developing in the rest of the world in the same way as China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 Pandemic.
In the issue of Eurosurveillance of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, which met the criteria for WHO to determine the incidence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were recorded in France on 24 January 2020, with all three of the cases coming back from the city of Wuhan in Hubei, China.
As at 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had detected COVID-19 infections, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750, including 1,441 fatal cases, were reported in Italy alone.
Definition of the cumulative quantity and cumulative incidence of COVID-19
The European Center for the Control and Prevention of Diseases (ECDC) updates every day at 8 a.m. data on the number of reported COVID-19 cases in every country in the world from official sources, such as the Ministries of Health of those countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom and to compare them with Italy.
The COVID-19 prevalence rate was calculated on a total of 14 days of COVID-19, taking into account the normal COVID-19 current in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8 a.m. on 15 March 2020, as compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom
Trends in the 14-day period in EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom have been in line with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
The combined COVID-19 incidence in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom as a whole began to grow about 21 February, and there was a sharp leap (additional material) on 28 February 2020.
This was due mainly to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but in all other EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, there have been similar trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, compared to the same for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded at 8 a.m. on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom is comparable to the number recorded in Italy just three weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of registered COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom.
The observed trends in COVID-19 comulative disease suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this is despite the different steps in different countries, the differences in the response measures taken by national public health authorities, and perhaps the different criteria for the recognition of cases, and the different rules for the selection of patients for COVID-19 testing, including “up-to-date” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media indicated that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions were already as full as possible.
To date, data on the admission of patients from COVID-19 to hospitals and (or) the EU/EEA intensive care unit are only available for 6% and 1% of the cases, respectively (not reported).
However, there is a need to systematically collect such data in order to supplement the current data on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to a 2010 - 2011 study, there is a significant difference in the number of beds in intensive care and care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth update of the ECDC on the results of the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment presents scenarios for the application of health system resources with an estimate of the hospitalization of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, where the risk of a shortage of available beds in intensive care units is over 90%.
As the cases are currently grouped into certain EU/EEA and British regions, and hospitals and intensive care units tend to serve the population of a certain territorial group, information on the incidence of infection and the number of beds in intensive care units is recommended to provide, as far as possible, level 2 Nomenclatures of territorial units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy ' s experience and current trends in other countries show that in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing.
For this reason, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to be prepared for a long-term SARS-COV-2 contact scenario and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who need medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as can be seen in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the most recent ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment, a rapid, pre-emptive and integrated approach to halting the spread of SARS-COV-2 is of great importance, moving from containment to minimizing the impact, as, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision-makers and hospitals may not have enough time to understand, adopt and adjust their response, as appropriate, if such measures are not taken in advance.
The report on the rapid risk assessment also listed public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time in which they can step up their monitoring efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-COV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, in the coming days or weeks, the health system in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients who will need intensive care.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of type 2 (SARS-COV-2) has become a tragedy for humanity: to date, more than 3,000 people have died in China and elsewhere, and more than 80,000 people have been infected.
Like the homologous SARS-COV virus, which led to the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-COV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and has similar symptoms, using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower incidence of disease and a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older persons more often than young and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of new infections, this article provides a relevant and comprehensive overview of the fast-growing subject of the study.
We will look at the basics of epidemiology, ethology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While the answers to many of the questions are still to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate a dangerous disease.
The spring festival (Chinese New Year), which fell on January 25, was an unprecedented and memorable event for all Chinese, who, in the wake of the outbreak of a new viral infection, were urged to stay at home throughout the festival and for weeks after it.
In view of the high level of coronavirus (COV), which led to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the virus SARS-COV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) as a coronavirus.
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout the country, and then to almost 50 other countries in the world.
As at 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been detected, and more than 40,000 patients had recovered, and more than 3,000 patients had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the number one enemy to society” and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have been published in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of January 7, 2020, which defined the sequencing of a virus separate from a number of patients.
The review is an attempt to sum up the results of the studies in a new and fast-growing subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus-induced disease, the coronavirus of the Middle East Respirator Syndrome (MERS), which erupted in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts about the prevention and forecasting of the current, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been among pathogens, which are not fatal to humans, and are mostly responsible for about 15% of the total respiratory disease.
However, in this century, we have two times been confronted with the highly pathogened coronavirus of man, that is, the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory Syndrome (SARS-COV2) and the coronavirus of the Middle East Respirator Syndrome (MERS-COV), which caused an outbreak of disease in China in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other states with a terrible severity of disease and death.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, for the first time, a report on the cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin was submitted to the National Health Commission of the PRC from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, a genetic sequencing of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death in the city of Wuhan was reported.
In the meantime, the epidemic has rapidly spread to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, the infection of health-care workers was reported, suggesting that the virus could be transmitted from man to man.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was invaded, and urban public transport was shut down.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of the disease, 21 out of 41 patients with a confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered a starting point for infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of the coronavirus was a global public health emergency.
At the time of the preparation of the report, the disease had spread throughout China and had already infiltrated about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
In view of the rapid evolution of the situation, the final scope and risk of an outbreak has yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centric clinical study, in which 8,866 patients, including 4,021 with COVID-19 confirmed, provided an updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-COV-2 has been exposed to all age groups, but most people between 30 and 65 years of age have been infected.
Nearly half (47.7 per cent) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few under 20, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-COV-2 infection among men is higher (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was distributed by clusters mainly in Hubei and the surrounding regions.
On average, 5 days (2–9) have been taken from the time COVID-19 symptoms were shown to be diagnosed.
The incubation period averaged 4.8 days (3.0–7.2).
From the moment of the symptoms to the time of death, an average of 9.5 days (4.8-13 days) was spent.
The base output (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the corrected R0 was 2.23-4.8.
By January 23, 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected persons, which coincided with large-scale transport on the eve of China's New Year.
The mortality rate for patients with a confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10 - 1.86%) and the adjusted death rate for patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02 - 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 contamination were: gender (male), age (×60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a sub-family of large shell viruses containing one string of RNA.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and beta-coronaviruses are known to be affecting humans.
In the event of a fall in coronaviruses of type SARS and MERS, glycoprotein of spice-shaped strata (S) is connected to cell receptors of type 2 angiotenzine-transforming enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidyl pepidesis 4 (DPP4) respectively, followed by membrane fusion.
In the cytoplasm, the genome of the viral RNA is released; after replication of the viral genome, the genome RNA, along with the glycoproteins and the proteins of the nucleocopsis, generates viron-containing vectors, which then merge with the membrane of the cell, freeing the virus.
The first SARS-COV-2 genomic sequencing report was released on January 10, 2020.
SARS-COV-2 is found to be a new type of beta-coronavirus, whose genome is 99.98% the same as the 10 sequential samples collected at the first outbreak in the Juanan seafood market in Wuhan.
==History==SARS-COV-2 is more genetically close to SARS-COV than to MERS-COV.
SARS-COV-2 particles have been found in ultra-tone human breath epithelia by means of an eclipsing electronic microscopy.
The human enzyme ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-COV-2, as well as for SARS-COV.
However, S-prothein SARS-Cov-2 links to the human enzyme ACE2 less than in the case of SARS-COV, which explains the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes patients to have a lower severity than SARS-COV.
SARS-COV-2 can also generate an orf3b-coded, previously unknown short-lived protein and an orf8-coded orf8.
Orf3b of the SARS-CV-2 virus can play a role in the pathogen of the virus and suppress the expression IFNß; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a group of authors led by Zhou (Zhou) submitted a report on the cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-length ACE2 human enzyme, with a resolution of 2.9 Ö at the B0AT1 aminocilot transporter.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed information, was collected as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-protenins, which is proof of coronavirus recognition and infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target in a drug screening to control the SARS-COV-2 infection.
Origin and Intermediate Master
Both SARS-COV and MERS-COV are known to be the source of bats from which the virus was transmitted to humans through liquor and camels, respectively.
By means of a philogenetic comparison between SARS-COV-2 and other coronaviruses, it was found that the first owners of SARS-COV-2 are bats, as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely, the coronaviruses of SL-COVZX45 and SL-COVX21.
However, it is not known what kind has become an intermediate host, which has enabled the virus to break the species barrier and infect humans, and the way of transmission has yet to be determined.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the vectors of the virus from bats to man had become snakes, leading to a homologous recombination in the S-protene.
According to their research, Chinese scientists in Guangzhou suggested that the pangolines, long-size mammals who are fed by ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this is based on a 99% genetic resemblance between the pangoline coronavirus and SARS-COV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still very large, so it is considered that the final results with specific evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-COV-2 are, for the most part, still unknown.
In the laboratory conditions, SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature below 20 °C and between 40 and 50 per cent wet.
SARS-COV-2 can have similar properties.
SARS-COV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heated up to 56°C for 30 minutes; the virus can be effectively blocked by ester, 75% ethyl alcohol, chlorine disinfectants, percussic acid, chloroform and other fat-contaminated solvents, but not chlorgexide.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-COV-2, so people are receptive to the new virus.
At present, there is no data on detailed research on the SARS-COV-2 immune response.
So we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, especially SARS-COV and MERS-COV (Figure 4).
Typically, the virus in the host first recognizes the inborn immune system by means of image-recognition receptors (ORPs), including electron C-type, toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
By means of a variety of mechanisms, the virus causes the excitation of inflammation factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the fusion of type I interferones, which inhibit the spread of the virus and speed up the fagocytosis of macrophages against viral antigens.
But thanks to the SARS-COV N-Quick, it can avoid an immune response.
Soon an adaptive immune response is included in the fight against the virus.
T-limphocytes, including T-cells CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in the protection of the body.
T-cells CD4+ stimulate the generation of viral-special antibodies in B-cells, and T-cells CD8+ directly kill virus-infected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokin, which help defensive cells.
The coronavirus, however, can inhibit T cell functions, causing their programd death.
Humoral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies from a cured patient neutralized MERS-COV.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system results in the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst scenario will result in polyorganic failure and even death.
The SARS-COV-2 infection, which is characterized by a cluster, is more likely to affect older persons with associated pathologies and pregnant women.
The risk of infection is higher for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have an immune system disorder.
According to a survey of the first 425 infections in the city of Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period SARS-COV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mostly from 3 to 7 days.
A study of 1,099 cases, however, revealed an average incubation period of 3 days, with a difference of between 0 and 24 days.
More recently, a study based on the demography of 8,866 cases found that the incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0–7.2).
For the health authorities, it is very important to adjust the time frame for the imposed Quarantine measures to take into account the most accurate calculation of the length of the incubation period, so as to prevent the spread of the virus by those infected with the disease without any sign.
It is common practice to have a 14-day quarantine for persons who have been in contact with the virus or who have been infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often a high temperature, which can be the only sign, or can be accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, pain in the air, pain in the muscles, dizziness, headache, pain in the throat, sniffing, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients, one week after the outbreak of the disease, suffered from breath and (or) hypoxy.
In severe cases, the disease has progressed rapidly, and patients have developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulosis.
High-temperature patients and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis, even if there are no pathologies on the chest.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following levels of symptoms: 98%, high, 76%, dry cough, 55%, and 3%, diarrhoea; 8% of the patients needed artificial lung ventilation.
The same results have been obtained from two recent studies of family infections and the transmission of the virus from unsympathetic infections.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 from a study of patients with MERS-COV, who also had high temperatures (98%), dry cough (47%) and breath (55%).
But 80 per cent of them needed artificial lung ventilation, which is much higher than for patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate of MERS than COVID-19.
Patients with MERs also had diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high temperature (99–100%), dry cough (29–75%), breath (40–42%), diarrhea (20–25%) and throat pain (13–25%), and artificial lung ventilation is needed from 14–20%.
As at 14 February, COVID-19 had a 2% death rate, and the total number of confirmed cases in the world was 66,576.
By November 2002, the SARS mortality rate was 10 per cent of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a population study conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
According to an earlier study, the base ratio (R0) for SARS-COV-2 was set at 6.47 at 95 per cent of the confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-COV-2 with MERS-COV and SARA-COV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is given in Table 1.1.
The above figures show a higher potential for SARS-COV-2 proliferation than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but the mortality rate for the new virus is lower than the last two.
So it will be much more difficult to contain the SARS-COV-2 epidemic than the MERS-COV and SARS-COV epidemics.
Cluster displays often occur when infected within a single family or group of people who have met for any reason or have been on a single transport, such as a cruise ship.
Patients have often travelled to the city of Wuhan or to other affected regions, or have been living there or in contact with the infected or the sick in the last two weeks before the disease began.
However, according to the data provided in the reports, people can bear the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and the patients who have been treated from the hospital can again become carriers of the virus, and this is an alarm signal for the extension of the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or lower number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 have been diagnosed with white blood count < 4×109/L, including white blood cell levels < 1×109/L, as well as an increased level of aminotransferase and viremy.
Some patients found elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscular enzymes and myoglobin in their blood, while most patients had higher levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cells.
In the case of patients with a severe flow of disease, the D-dimer, the fibrine decomposition product present in the blood, has been raised, and the number of lymphocytes has been steadily declining.
Most of the patients with COVID-19 found pathologies in their breast X-rays with diverging eclipses on both sides or in their lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, severe lung damage, and acute respiratory disease (EPR).
In the development of an EPR, unchecked inflammation, accumulation of liquid and progressive fibrosis result in a major gas-exchange disruption.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes lowers surface-activated compounds and increases surface stress, thus reducing the ability of lungs to expand and increase the risk of lung fall.
So the worst X-ray results are often the same as the worst cases.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed the decoupling of pneumotic blood cells, the formation of hyalin membrane and intertwined lymphocytar infiltration, and multi-nuclear syncytic cells in the lungs of patients who have died of the disease are consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ORZs and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The main criterion used in the COVID-19 diagnosis was the method of detecting the RNA SARS-COV-2 by means of a polymeraceous chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (CPR with reverse transcryption).
However, in view of the high level of negative results, which can speed up the epidemic, China began to diagnose on the basis of clinical evidence from 13 February 2020 (not relying solely on the reverse transcrypted CPR).
The same was true of the SARS diagnosis.
For effective diagnosis, therefore, it is critical and necessary to combine the data from the history of the disease, clinical events, laboratory tests and the results of the X-ray study.
On 14 February 2020, a team of specialists, led by Mr. Feng Zhang, described a protocol for the application of SHERLOCK, based on a repetitive CRISPR, to detect SARS-COV-2; this method allows for the identification of synthetic fragments of the SARS-COV-2 RNA with a density of 20 × 10–18 mol/L to 200 × 10–18 mol/L (10–100 copies per microliter of the original model) with less than an hour without the use of complex equipment.
This new method, if successfully tested for clinical drugs, can greatly increase the sensitivity and user-friendliness of the tests.
Because of the lack of experience in countering the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mostly provide patients with COVID-19 with support therapy, while at the same time trying to use any therapeutic methods used or offered in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV, as well as other viral diseases (table 2.2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of anti-viral drugs, immunities, steroids, the plasma of healed patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and the provision of psychological support.
It was suggested that even the plasma of cured patients should be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to combat the virus.
In the initial stages, SARS-COV-2 attacks mainly the lungs, as well as possibly less the other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys.
Still, work failure and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of the death of patients.
Thus, in order to alleviate the symptoms and save lives, it is critical to support the respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen intake, non-invasive artificial ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, which is determined by the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extra-corporal membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary circulatory method used to treat life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
Also critical for patients with SARS-COV-2 is the maintenance of the water-salt balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organ functions.
It is known that the cytokin storm is the result of hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with the SARS and MERS viruses.
The cytokine storm is a form of a system inflammatory process that is developing in response to a series of cytokine selections, including TNFα, IL-1ß, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNß, IFN# and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immunocytes to emit a massive number of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of RHDs and polyorganic insufficiency.
In the treatment of the cytokin storm, especially in the case of patients in serious condition, the suppression of immunity is of the utmost importance.
Corticosteroids and tozilysumab, monoclonic antibodies, serving as interlakin-6 inhibitor, were used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other techniques for the treatment of the cytokin storm, based on the suppression of immunity, include modulation of the immune response to control of the T-cells; blocking the production of Cytokines IFN-1, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of the Janus-kinase; use of pancake tomobs, cytokine repressors 4 and hystondeacetalas ingibiters.
The use of steroids as an immunity agent is widespread in the treatment of SARS viruses to reduce the severity of inflammatory processes.
However, steroids in high dosage do not work to treat severe lung injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially awascular osteonocrosis, which significantly worsens the prediction.
However, short courses for corticosteroids in small and medium dosages are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no confirmed effective anti-virus therapy.
But the intravenous introduction of the remdesire, the nucleotide analogy, has proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivere is a newly developed anti-viral drug, originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of Ebola and Marburg virus-induced diseases.
Later, the Remdesire also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with single-chain RNAs, including MERS and SARS.
On the basis of this data, Gilead has provided this drug to China to do a couple of research on patients infected with SARS-COV-2, and the results of these studies are very much awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavira and fishavirus have been offered as options for the treatment of patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination treatment with lopinavirus/ritonavirus can be accompanied by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver failure and other side actions.
The interaction of these drugs with other drugs assigned to patients should be monitored with caution.
Plasma of healed patients and antibodies
Absorption of blood from patients who have been cured of a contagious disease has been used for the treatment of other patients who are suffering from the same disease or for the protection of a healthy population for a long time.
And in fact, the blood of healed patients often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to combat pathogen.
The antibodies are in the immunoglobulin, which is produced by B-limphocytes to control pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and neutralize them in a targeted way.
On the basis of this condition, plasma was extracted from blood samples from a group of patients who had been cured of COVID-19, which was then injected with 10 seriously ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the severity of the inflammation and the viral load decreased, and the saturation of blood with oxygen increased.
However, an untested test and an uncompleted explanation are needed to suggest that the method be used in a massive way before the specific treatment is carried out.
In addition, in view of the therapeutic effect, some deficiencies in the use of plasma should be carefully studied.
For example, antibodies can over-instimate the immune system and cause Cytokin Syndrome, which, given the toxicity, is a potential risk to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the plasma is needed to treat patients in critical condition.
It is not easy to design and produce specific antibodies fast enough to combat the global epidemic.
So it's more important and more practical to separate the B-cells of healed patients and to define the genetic code for effective antibodies, or to screen to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can go straight to the massive production of antibodies.
The Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat a variety of diseases for millennia.
Its effectiveness, however, depends to a large extent on a combination of multiple components of the formula, which differs from the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have an undetermined effect, as it is difficult to separate and test these components or to test their optimum mix.
At present, due to the lack of effective specific treatment for COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild and moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe state of illness.
For example, the Su Feng Jie Du capsules and the Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest rate of recovery from COVID-19 was found in a number of China ' s provinces, where 87 per cent of patients were treated with Chinese traditional medicine, including Gansu (63.7 per cent), Ninshia (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in Hubei, where only about 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 were treated with Chinese traditional medicine, the lowest rate of recovery (13 per cent).
This is, however, a rather rude comparison, as the evaluation should take into account a wide range of other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively to Western medicine and combined treatment to Western and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the time frame for normalizing the body temperature, correcting the symptoms and providing in-patient care was considerably lower for patients who were treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients who were treated only in Western medicine.
Most surprisingly, the proportion of patients who began to deteriorate from mild to severe symptoms was markedly lower in the group, which was treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine, than in the group, which was treated by Western methods alone (7.4 per cent, as opposed to 46.2 per cent), and the death rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8 per cent, as compared to 39 per cent).
Nevertheless, the efficiency and security of Chinese traditional medicine still require more carefully monitored research on a larger scale and in a larger number of regions.
It is also of interest if possible to have a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine or a combination of them.
Patients suspected or confirmed of having COVID-19 are mostly fearful of acutely contagious and even fatal diseases, and those who are in quarantine are also bored, alone, and extremely irritated.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as side-effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even more anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the outbreak of the SARS virus, a number of mental diseases have been reported, including chronic depression, high anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotorized fitness, psychotic symptoms, deliriums, and even suicidal behaviour.
Compulsory contact monitoring and quarantine, which are among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people's anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
Patients with COVID-19, persons under suspicion and in contact with them, as well as all other people who require it, should be provided with psychological and mental support.
In the context of psychological support, multi-professional mental health teams should be set up, clear information should be provided with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-COV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and professional electronic devices and apps should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Efficient vaccines play an important role in interrupting the transfer chain from animal vectors and infected people to sensitive hosts, and are often used in addition to anti-viral therapy to contain new virus-induced epidemics.
Work has been done to develop S-protein-based vaccines to develop long-lived and highly active antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
In the course of animal studies, live, weakened vaccines against SARS viruses have been developed.
However, prior to the start of the clinical studies, the impact of these possible vaccines in the natural context when used in age-old patients, the model of lethal doses, and the degree of protection against the infection of zoonosis viruses need to be determined.
Perhaps the reason is the fact that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clustering of the disease caused by the MERS virus are still emerging in the Middle East and spreading to other regions, thanks to the conservation of zoonous sources in the endemic habitats.
To combat MERs, vaccination strategies have been developed using an inert virus, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles and elements of recombinant proteins, some of which have been assessed on animals.
The development of a safe and effective anti-SARS-COV-2 vaccine for those who do not enjoy immunity is an urgent and critical task that needs to be addressed in order to contain the raging epidemic.
There are, however, serious difficulties due to the long time (average 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine and the dynamic evolution of coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show a full picture of the clinical current of the disease at the cost of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients have been able to recover without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with the high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with a severe period of illness.
In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to develop a prognostic model of the disease in order to give priority to their interventions, especially in areas where there is a lack of resources.
Based on the current clinical data, the following factors may have an impact on the prediction of the current of the disease in patients with COVID-19 or be associated with it (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the current of the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 hits mainly patients between 30 and 65 years of age, 47.7 per cent of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study, 8,866 cases.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have original diseases and complications, and they were much older than those who did not need such treatment (average of 66 years as opposed to 51 years), which indicates that age is a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-COV-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0.31/100,000 as compared to 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Sickness and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who need intensive care are more likely to have acute myocardial and arrhythmic injuries.
Cardiology was also a major cause of death for SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-COV-2 can also link to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and original diseases are closely intertwined and can distort results.
Deviations found in laboratory studies: C-reactive protein levels in blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered a potential prognostic factor in the current of the disease, the response to therapy and the final recovery.
It was also suggested that the relationship between C-reactive protein, the severity of the disease and the prognosis at COVID-19 should be taken into account.
In addition, an increased level of lactatedehydrogenase, aminotranspheric aperture, alanin-aminotransphrase and creatinase can also predict the result.
These enzymes are in large quantities separate from different organs, especially from the heart and the liver, and they are released when the tissues are damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: In order to predict the results and complications of COVID-19 treatment, the data from the chest X-ray and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account, together with other factors.
The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunities that are commonly used in infectious diseases as additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids have been widely used to treat SARS patients, many of the survivors have developed awascular osteonectorosis, which has led to life-long disability and a low quality of life.
Thus, if there is a need to use steroids to treat patients with COVID-19, the drugs should be given in small dosages and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseeable high stress, as they often have to withstand long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty, and watch their relatives and other patients die.
In order to relieve the stress of such patients and help them to return to normal life, they must be provided with psychological counselling and long-term support.
According to the demographic studies carried out so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to differ from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower airway, the SARS-COV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common colds, can successfully reproduce in the upper airway and cause weak or no symptoms at all at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients who have not completed the early stage of the disease or who have not yet completed the incubation period can, through their normal life, spread the virus on a significant scale, making it much more difficult to control the epidemiology.
It was believed, however, that the transmission of the SARS-CoV virus occurs when patients are seriously ill, while in most cases the infection has not occurred at an early stage.
So today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it's hard to control.
China is currently doing a lot of work in the area of universal quarantine in the city of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the extension of the quarantine regime for almost the entire population, which has been put in place to break the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
While these measures have caused immense harm to the economy and other areas of the country ' s life, the number of new patients being identified has been declining, indicating a slower spread of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will be over by March, and the fading phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
Some experts, however, are less optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Hunter) and his colleagues estimated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which was much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from a group led by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) have developed a model to predict the end of the epidemic, and have suggested that the SARS-COV-2 virus can affect two thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadian experts reported that the SARS-COV-2 virus was found in swabs from the nose and throat of patients who had recovered from the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclic disease similar to the flu.
However, the decline in new cases in China is encouraging, pointing out that the strategies currently in place may have had an impact.
Initial forecasts suggest that Ebola would cause up to a million people to die and half a million patients to die.
But because of strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally under control.
It is likely that, like the SARS-COV virus, the infective potential of the SARS-COV-2 virus can weaken, and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenous virus co-existing with humans.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Figure 55).
The SARS-COV-2 virus has a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, as well as possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in the cripple, which means that an oral-fecal mode of transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have been the result of an infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Thus, serious precautionary measures should be taken to protect the population, especially health-care workers, social workers, their relatives, co-workers and even outsiders, who are in contact with patients or infected.
The first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks for the face; and the surgical masks and N95 respirators (Serie No. 1860s) help to control the spread of viruses.
Surgeon masks do not allow micro-capable liquids from potentially infected people to fly in the air and settle on the surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (Serie No. 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virion sizes of 10 to 80 nm, they miss only 5% of the virion; the SARS-COV-2 virus of the same size as the SARS-COV, both of which are about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks folded together, health-care professionals in direct contact with patients must wear N95 masks (Serial No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health-care workers should wear a uniformed protective robe to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also come into the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-COV-2 even though he wore a Class N95 mask; the virus may have hit his body through inflammed eyes.
Therefore, health-care workers should also wear transparent face-slips or closed-stroke sunglasses.
The general population in affected or potentially at risk regions is urged to wash their hands with disinfectant washing tools more frequently, to try to stay home with self-insulation, and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
A reasonable distance to a patient is a distance of about one metre.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-COV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, the high level of its resemblance to SARS-COV, as reported on 7 January 2020, was to be a warning to China, taking into account the experience it had gained during the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the Director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control calmed the population, reporting that the new virus was low contagious and limited in the way of human-to-human transmission, and that prevention and control of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement has greatly eased social tensions, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing to celebrate China ' s New Year, and a critical time has been missed when the disease could be contained within the city of Wuhan with minimal losses.
China ' s health authorities can learn this hard lesson and make meaningful improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, as every word is taken into account by citizens and can affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) follow more closely and respond to unusual information from clinics rather than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more resolute action to contain a potential epidemic in the early stages of its development rather than soothe the public; and (4) implement more focused and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly screen and improve the public response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19, due to a previously unexplored coronavirus of severe acute respirator Syndrome Type II (SARS-COV-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread to all China and, at the time of writing, has spread to 50 countries in the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the coronavirus of the severe acute respirator syndrome (SARS-COV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of the severe acute respirator syndrome (SARS), the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a relapse of SARS.
However, there are some major differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are relevant to the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 hits older persons more than young people and men more than women; the incidence of serious cases and the mortality rate among older persons are also higher than among young people.
Deaths as a result of SARS are higher than in COVID-19 (10.91% as compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is unsymbolized, while patients with SARS tend to infect others only in severe cases, so it is more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-COV-2 is spreading much faster and wider than SARS-COV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal RNA SARS-COV-2 samples.
On the other hand, cured patients can again show positive samples for the virus.
All of this greatly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
Against the background of such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, some critical issues remain to be resolved, as follows:
What is the origin of the SARS-COV-2 virus?
Despite the detection of a 96% homologue between SARS-COV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, we still can't say that SARS-COV-2 infection was from bats.
What kind of animal has become an intermittent species that has passed the virus from the original host, such as bats, to man?
Without the answers to the first and second questions, we can't reliably interrupt the transfer path, and the epidemiology can get worse at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemistry have shown that SARS-COV-2 is connected to ACE2, but how does the virus get in the airway cells and cause the next pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to the ACE2-producing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to those questions, we cannot provide rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve in the process of human-to-human transfer?
Will it cause a global pandemic, or will it go away just like SARS, or will it relapse from time to time like a flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
But we have no choice but, whatever the cost, to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and to return to normal life.
Zoonous origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated co-evolence of coronaviruses (COV) and their hosts, including humans, for millennia.
Prior to 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses (HCV) cause a mild disease, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respirator syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respirator Syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening a human coronavirus can be.
The appearance of a coronavirus of severe acute respirator Syndrome type II (SARS-COV-2) in Central China in late 2019 again drew attention to the coronaviruses and surprised us with the high transmission, but less pronounced pathogens of the virus than the associated SARS-CoV virus.
A coronary human infection is a zoonosis, and an understanding of its zoonous origin will be very useful.
Most of the coronaviruses of humans are from bats for which they are not pathogens.
There are also known intermediate carriers of some human coronaviruses.
The definition of animal carriers has a direct impact on the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Exploring coronavirus - bearers of animals can also shed light on coronavirus pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we provide available data on the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as on their zoonous origins and modes of inter-species transfer.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing the different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of the coronavirus found in 2019 (COVID-19) is also under consideration.
In addition, the conditions necessary for a successful change of hosts and the effect of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive-polar RNA.
The viruses with the largest RNA-containing genome, which contains between 26 and 32,000 nucleotides, have been named because of their form, which, when viewed under an electronic microscope, is like a crown.
From a structural point of view, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with the same organization.
About two thirds of the genome contains two major open, partially overrunning read-out frames (ORF1a and OrF1b), which are aired in polyprothenes of app1a and pp1ab relics.
These polyprotenes are later processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, labeled nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open frame of reading for structured proteins, including spiky protein (S), magenta protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprothene (N).
Other coronaviruses have also coded a number of linia-special accessor proteins.
On the basis of the differences in the sequencing of the squirrel \ coronaviruses are divided into four types (alpha, beta, gamma, and deltacoronaviruses), with betacoronaviruses containing most of the human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is philologic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha- and beta-coronaviruses is bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and delta-coronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly overcome inter-species barriers, and some of them have evolved to pathogens that are dangerous to humans.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include the human alphacorn viruses HCV-229E and HCV-NL63.
The remaining five beta-coronviruses include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, the coronavirus of the severe acute respirator Syndrome (SARS-COV), the coronavirus of the Middle East Respirator Syndrome (MERS-COV) and the coronavirus of the severe acute respirator Syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
Human coronaviruses HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 tend to cause mild symptoms, such as cold and (or) diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-COV, MERS-COV and the recently discovered SARS-COV-2 are highly pathogenous, causing severe infective diseases in lower respiratory paths in relatively more patients with a higher risk of acute respiratory disease (ARS) and abnormal symptoms.
The first strand of the human coronavirus HCV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample of a nostolic sip of patients who had a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has generated more knowledge of the HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 viruses, which cause symptoms of local infection.
In fact, before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) there was a generally accepted concept that the human coronavirus was considered harmless in general.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating epidemics in the current history; more than 8,000 people were overwhelmed, and the overall death rate was about 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East Respirator Syndrome (MERS) led to a long-term epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease sporadically spreading to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCov), which was later renamed SARS-COV-2, was found in 2019 and is the cause of the current coronavirus epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which, as of March 3, 2020, has claimed more than 3,120 lives, and the number of people infected is over 91,000.
The alarm signal has been received, and the world has to prepare for the coming SARS-COV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have zoonic origins, their origins are bats, mice, or pets.
Multiple data sets show the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats with well-adapted viruses, with no pathogen but a wide range of genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has challenged China and the world in a medical, scientific, social, and moral way.
A study of the zoonic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will help to understand their natural history, the drivers of their evolution, and the factors limiting inter-species transport.
It may also suggest or speed up the search for the SARS-COV-2 container, an intermediate and amplifying medium, which is very important to prevent the re-emerging of the disease in the future.
The survey provides an overview of the zoonous origin, inter-species transfer and pathogens of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we refer to and consider the following common feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses have been produced are not usually pathogens for their reservoir carriers, but have become pathogenous after inter-species transmission to a new host.
We are also analysing the evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which the increase in transmissibility is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogens.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-COV-2 outbreak is also considered.
The coronaviruses of animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the strain of the HCV-229E virus was first extracted from a nosole-seating sample of cold patients, various coronaviruses were found in different infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been detected in recent decades.
Table 1 informs and illustrates the short history of the detection of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCV-229E virus was derived from samples from the respiratory paths of the infective upper respiratory paths in 1966; the virus was later adapted to the replication in the pulmonary cell lines of the WI-38.
Patients infected with the HCV-229E virus exhibited cold symptoms, including headache, sneeze, general malaise, and throat pain, with high temperatures and coughing in 10-20% of the cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCV-OC43 virus was singled out from the organ culture and the subsequent massage in the brain of the sucker mice.
The clinical signs of HCV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCV-229E, the symptoms of which are indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogens, such as A-type flu viruses and rhinoviruses.
And the HCV-229E virus, and the HCV-OC43 virus, are common in the world and are usually transmitted in the winter at moderate latitudes.
Mostly the incubation period of the two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by a disease of about two weeks.
According to a study on volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCV-229E virus have developed a common lung cold.
Only a handful of patients with reduced immunity have been exposed to a severe infection of the lower airway.
The outbreak of SARS, also known as the “typical pneumonia epidemic”, was the first well-documented pandemic in human history, caused by the coronavirus, and the virus of SARS-CoV, the third known human coronavirus, was the cause of the disease.
The first case of SARS was found at the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread to many countries and continents.
It was estimated, without taking into account the over-activities, that each of the patients could infect about two more people; the incubation period ranged from 4 to 7 days, and the viral stress peaked at 10 days of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-COV had initial pains in their muscles, headaches, high temperatures, general maladies and colds, and later symptoms included breath, coughing, and respiratory failure.
The common deviations of the labs from the SARS standard are lymphopium, liver-testing disorders, and a higher level of creatinase.
Patients with SARS also have diffuse alveolar damage, epithelic cell proliferation, and a rise in macrofags.
About 20–30% of the patients are in need of intensive care and mechanical ventilation of their lungs.
Other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, the liver and the kidneys, can also be infected in such cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tracts, usually accompanied by a cytokin storm, which may be fatal, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
The virus was first singled out from an open biopsy of a patient's lung relative, who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a great deal of effort has been devoted to the study of human coronaviruses.
In late 2004, HCV-NL63 was assigned to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
Initially, it was found to be mainly affecting young children, the elderly and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
HCV-NL63 is characterized by snot, conjunctivitis, high temperature, and bronchiolite.
Another independent study describes the release of the same virus from an 8-month-old boy in the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was found in the Netherlands, but in fact it is common.
It is estimated that HCV-NL63 is the cause of some 4.7 per cent of common respiratory diseases, and the peak of the diseases it causes is at the start of summer, spring and winter.
HCV-NL63 is linked to a blocking laryngite, also called a croupe.
HCV-HKU1 was singled out in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolite.
In addition to out-of-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolite, HCV-HKU1 is associated with asthmatic diseases.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCV-229E, and HCV-OC43, the HCV-HKU1 virus, which causes lung respiratory diseases, was found all over the world.
All four of the coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections have been well-adapted to people, and their mutation, which has led to highly pathogenous diseases, is generally unlikely, even though the incidents and their causes are unknown, as in a rare example with a more virulent subtype of HCOV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused a serious infection of the lower airway in China.
Normally, by acquiring the ability to effectively transfer and stay in humans, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenous.
The Coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV) was first released in Saudi Arabia in 2012 from a light 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure.
Most of the laboratory-confirmed cases have taken place in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia there have been import cases and distributions through sporadic secondary cases of contagion in close contact.
Another secondary outbreak of 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical effects of the Middle East Respirator Syndrome (MERS) are similar to the symptoms of severe acute respirator Syndrome (SARS), both of which are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
In contrast to SARS, many MERS patients have also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from the rest of the disease caused by coronaviruses transmitted to humans.
More than 30 per cent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed high-death Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (34.4 per cent), MERS-CoV is considered to be one of the most deadly viruses known to man.
From mid to late December 2019, the city of Wuhan in Hubei, China, was found to be a group of patients with pneumonia, which is now, in the past, linked to a coronavirus of severe acute respirator Syndrome type 2 (SARS-CV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the continued outbreak of low-level respiratory infections caused by SARS-COV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has become known as the Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases in the world, with approximately 3.4 per cent of the deaths.
It should be noted that the Chinese province of Hubei has a mortality rate of 4.2 per cent, while it has an external mortality rate of 1.2 per cent.
SARS-COV-2, like the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by a rise in temperature, cough, and breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to move fast to acute respiratory Syndrome.
Despite the resemblance of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses still form different branches of philogenetic tree.
SARS-COV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but has a greater potential for transmission than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
SARS-COV-2 cases of non-symptom-free infection have been recorded, indicating the potential for the virus to spread rapidly around the world.
A comparison and comparison of SARS-COV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.
First, human transmissible coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease they cause.
In this respect, SARS-COV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 is between SARS-COV and four human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections (i.e. HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the one hand, the incidence of SARS-COV-2 infection is similar to that of human coronaviruses, which cause out-of-hospital infections, including non-specialized symptoms, mild symptoms, or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-COV, a small sub-group of serious COVID-19 cases can be distinguished, although the ratio is a bit lower.
Third, the SARS-COV-2 transfer plan also shows interesting patterns of both human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections and SARS-COV.
On the one hand, the transferability of SARS-COV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections.
On the other hand, it is still to be checked whether the transmission of SARS-COV-2 is decreasing with each subsequent transfer of the virus (i.e. the infection of each next person), as in the cases of SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections, SARS-COV-2 can be found in scala samples.
We still have to answer the question of whether the felony-oral path of SARS-COV-2 is as important (at least in some circumstances) as it is for SARS-COV.
Of particular interest is the question of the possible seasonality of SARS-COV-2, which is common to human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections.
However, the future development of the continued COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the features of SARS-COV-2, including transferability, pathogenity, and sustainable distribution after a human transition.
All four human coronaviruses, which cause out-of-hospital infections with mild-shaped symptoms, have been well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, it may be people who have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both might be the only survivors of past human coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronaviruses, which cause serious diseases in humans, and people who have human coronaviruses that cause serious diseases, have simply not survived.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses need to be re-replicated in the human body in a sufficient way to result in an accumulation of adaptive mutations that are countering the constraints of the host.
In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-COV-2 lasts, and the more people are infected, the more likely the virus is to be fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop its transfer among humans by means of quarantine or other measures to control infectious diseases.
For many years, four extra-hospital coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing common colds in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses don't need an animal reserve.
The highly pathogenous coronaviruses SARS-COV and MERS-COV have not adapted to man well enough, and their transmission among humans cannot be sustained.
They need to stay and reproduce in their zoonous tanks and to look for the occurrence of vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or augmenting hosts.
SARS-COV-2 has features such as SARS-COV/MERS-COV, and four HCV out-of-hospital viruses.
It's very easy to pass on as an out-of-hospital HCOV, at least now.
But it's more pathogenous than HCV out-of-hospital, and less pathogen than SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to man and whether it will circulate in a human environment without a container or an intermediate animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying, and reservoir hosts of HCV viruses.
The animal is an evolutionary host of HCOV if it carries a close-born ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequencing level.
The ancestors are usually well-adapted and not pathogenous in this medium.
In the same way, HCOV has been a constant host for a long time.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCOV or its parent virus.
By contrast, if HCOV was just hidden in an intermediate host right before or about the time it was taken by a man, it was not well adapted to the new host and was often pathogen.
This intermediate medium can be a zoonotic source of human infection and can play a growing host role, allowing the virus to reproduce in a zipper-like way, and then handing it over to people, increasing the incidence of human infection.
HCOV can cope with a dead end if it cannot withstand a transfer within an intermediate host.
On the contrary, HCV viruses can also be adapted to an intermediate medium, and can even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir bearer.
Epidemiological data have shown retrospectively that a zero patient in SARS had an anomaly of contact with hunter-harvest animals (wilder).
Further studies of seroprevalence have shown that the incidence of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV virus is higher than the population as a whole.
The Himalayan cybetes (Paguma larvata) and the raccoon dog on the market for live animals have become the first known carriers of viruses, such as and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was implicitly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all the larvae in the markets, the cases of SARS were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that, in most cases, the Himalayan cyves, who live in nature or on farms and do not enter the markets, were not defined by the SARS-COV, which led to the conclusion that the Himalayan cybetes could serve only as an intermediate augmenting host, not as a natural SARS-CoV tank.
Notably, since 80 per cent of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have antibodies to SARS-COV, it cannot be ruled out that multiple species of small mammals can also be used as intermediate augmentors.
They all seem to be the deadliest bearers of the SARS-COV virus.
A follow-up search for a natural SARS-CoV animal found a close-circuited COV of bats, which was known to be associated with atypical pneumonia-related coronavirus of sub-colonous bats HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCov HKU3) and which is present in the Chinese subcodile bats.
These mice are positive on antibodies to SARS-COV and the genomic sequence SARSr-Rh-BatCov HKU3.
These and other coronaviruses of bats have the same homology of nucleotide sequences as SARS-CoV for 88-92%.
These studies have laid the groundwork for a new concept that bats have become bearers of new human pathogens.
The bats also found several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-Cov), but none of them, except one, which means WIV1, can't be isolated as a living virus.
SARS-COV is known to be a human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, from a test of bat feces, used ACE2 bats, liquor, and humans as a receptor to the cell.
Interestingly, the serums of recovering patients from SARS could neutralize the WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, splitting up 95% of the nucleotide nucleotide homology.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally considered that WIV1 is not the direct parent of the SARS-COV virus, and bats are not the direct reservoir host of the SARS-COV virus.
The MERS-CoV is considered to be the same group as the COV-HKU4 bats, and the COV-HKU5 bats.
COV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipepyl-dipepidesis-4 (DPP4) to infiltrate viruses.
The RNA-dependant RNA polymerase of the MERS-CoV virus is philogeneticly closer to the sequences of betacoronviruses of bats found in Europe and Africa.
So far, wild bats have not found a live MERS-COV virus.
The homology of the MERS-COV nucleotide sequences and its next of kin, COV-HKU25 bats, is only 87%.
So bats may not have been the direct reservoir bearer of the MERS-COV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-brown camels are sero-positive of antibodies that are specific to MERS-COV, as well as of Middle Eastern camels in many African countries.
The living MERS-COV, which is the same as the virus found in humans, was singled out from the base swabs of a single-rib camel, which further confirms the role of the camels as the true MERS-CoV reservoir hosts.
It is also worth noting that camels experimented with MERS-COV had mild symptoms, but massive viral dispersion.
Notably, the infected camels have released the virus not only by respiratory means, but also by fecal-oral means, which is also the main way of extracting the virus from bats.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome do not have any prior contact with the camels, and are plausible in terms of human transmission or transmission by unknown channels, including unknown species, which are the hosts of MERS-COV.
The nucleotide homology of SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2 per cent the same as the COV RaTG13 of the bats in the Asian subcolons Rhinophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-COV and MERS-COV, the divergence between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is too big to attribute parenting to them.
So bats may not have been the direct reservoir host of SARS-COV-2, unless in the future almost identical coronaviruses of bats are found.
Suggestedly, the direct animal carriers of the SARS-COV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and slaughtered on the whanan optic market for seafood, which was associated with many initial COVID-19 cases, which indicates a possible transfer from an animal to a human.
A number of recent meta-genomic sequencing studies have found that a group of endangered small mammals, known as pangolines (Manis javanica), may also have been able to transport a parent betacoronavirus associated with the SARS-CoV-2 strain.
The homology of the nucleotide sequencing of these new genomes is 85-92% the same as SARS-COV-2.
But they're also closely related to RaTG13, with an identity at the nucleotide sequence level of about 90%.
They are grouped into two sublines of the differentiation of viruses, such as SARS-COV-2, in a philogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-linking dome (RSD) closer to SARS-COV-2 with a 97.4 per cent amino acid sequencing.
In contrast, SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 RSDs are more divisive, despite a higher degree of homology of sequencing in the entire genome.
An earlier study of Pangolin patients also reported on the definition of viral contingencies in lung samples, which were similarly related to SARS-COV-2.
The study used other methods of assembling and hand-processing to produce a genome sequencing of about 86.3 per cent of the full-size viral genome.
It is not possible to rule out the possibility that the pangoline has become one of the intermediate sars-Cov-2.
However, due to the diverging sequencing between SARS-COV-2 and the beta-coronaviruses of pangolines related to SARS-COV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-COV-2 from the pangoline.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-COV-2 and the beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-COV-2.
The evolutionary path SARS-COV-2 has not yet been set up for bats, pangolines, and other mammals.
While the highest homology of sequencing was found in the RSD between SARS-COV-2 and the beta-coronviruses of pangolines related to SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest homology of sequencing in the genome.
A very theoretically high level of resemblance between the beta-coron viruses of pangolines related to SARS-COV-2, and SARS-COV-2 is linked to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite is in favour of a recombination between the betacoron virus of pangolines, associated with SARS-COV-2, and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As a driving force for evolution, recombination is common among beta-coronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoonic origin of SARS-COV-2.
In addition to HCOV, the zoonic origins of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 are also being studied.
Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E can be from the coronaviruses of bats, while HCV-OC43 parent strains and HCV-HKU1 are found in rodents.
A coronavirus of bats, known as ARCOV 2, found in a North American three-coloured scoundrel, was reported to be closely related to HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCV-229E has a genetic connection to another coronavirus of bats called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that it might have been an intermediate bearer of camels.
For the sake of clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided proof of the events of the HCV inter-species transfer in ananalysis.
When the HCV-OC43 virus was transmitted interspecies in about 1890, and people were infected by pets, there was a pandemic of respiratory infections.
The history of HCV-229E inter-species is not so clear.
Alphacoronaviruses of bats, similar to HCOV-229E, have been found.
There's an alpaca alphacorn virus between them.
Some data support the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was people, not alpacas, who could have been in contact with bats in a common environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpacas.
Second, the alphacorn viruses of bats associated with HCV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenous in bats, while the alphacorn virus of alpaca has led to an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca alphacorn virus was not found in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that alpacas have received an alphacorn virus related to HCV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogens, including rabies, the Ebola virus, the Nippah virus, and the Hendra virus.
So it's not surprising that bats could pass HCV-229E directly to people.
On the other hand, while alphacorn viruses of bats could be the gene pool of the HCV-229E virus, alpacas and single-rib camels could be intermediate carriers of viruses to humans, just like in the case of the MERS-COV virus.
MERS-COV is an excellent example of inter-species transfers from bats to single-rib camels and from single-bracing camels to man.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known by its original identity and was then confirmed by follow-up studies.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of viruses for the interspecies exchange of gene fragments and interspecies.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction, and the ability to fly make bats “the ideal propagators. ”
On the other hand, the MERS-COV virus was introduced to one-rib camels a decade ago.
It was well adapted to these camels, which, from an intermediate medium, had become a stable and natural reservoir host.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild disease and has a relatively low rate of mutations.
His episodic transfer to a man is an accident, and a man is a dead end bearer of MERS-COV, as his transfer is not supported.
In contrast to the role of the camels in MERS-COV, the role of the pangolines, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-COV-2 virus is different.
In particular, the beta coronaviruses of pangolines are highly pathogenous in the pangolines.
They can be dead-end bearers of beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-Cov-2, as well as cybetes in the case of SARS-COV.
In future studies, several possibilities for inter-species transmission of the SARS-COV-2 virus from animals to humans need to be confirmed or eliminated.
First, bats can be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-COV-2, almost the same as SARS-COV-2.
Humans can share the ecological niche with bats by coaling or cutting the carcasses of these animals.
Second, the pangolines can be one of the intermediate amplifiers in which the SARS-COV-2 related virus has recently fallen.
People are infected with the virus by carcass cutting and eating wild animals.
It is possible that many animals, including the pets, are receptive to SARS-COV-2.
The study of pets and wild animals on antibodies is justifiable.
Third, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-COV-2 could have taken place in a third form, which was in contact with both bats and pangolines.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-COV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to the different types of animal carriers, the three main factors on the part of the viruses have also contributed to the cross-mattering of inter-species barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the estimated rate of mutations of coronaviruses can be considered to be “medium-high” with an average rate of between 10 and 4 replacements per year for one section 2 depending on the stage of adjusting the coronavirus to the new hosts.
Coronaviruses have an exorbitant exoribonuclease, the removal of which results in an extremely high rate of mutation and loss or even non-viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogy of Remdesivere is suppressing the relicing of coronaviruses by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase.
Remdesire is one of the most promising anti-SARS-COV-2 tools to be tested in clinical research.
However, the rate of mutations of coronaviruses is almost a million times higher than the rate of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation can often be even higher if the coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-COV with a high mutation rate, the frequency of SARS-COV-2 mutations is likely to be lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, this virus has already been adapted to another host close to humans.
Apart from SARS-COV-2, this also applies to MERS-COV, which is well adapted to single-armed camels.
Theoretically, vaccines and anti-viral drugs from SARS-COV-2 are unlikely to be quick to become ineffective as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large genome of RNA in coronaviruses leads to more plasticity in genomic changes for mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-species co-evolution, which is conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses, subject to conditions.
This is facilitated by the many unique open-ended reading frames and protein functions coded to the end of the genome.
Third, thanks to the unique mechanism for the selection of a matrix, coronaviruses randomly and often change the matrices during the replication of a RNA.
As the DNA of the coronavirus is transcribed in the host, which serves as a mixing vessel, the strings are often transcribed.
High-level, full-dimensional and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Philogenestic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43 and in coronaviruses, such as SL-Cov and bat-batCov-HKU9.
Synergies between the virus and the transfer
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, another key factor for inter-species transfer is the interaction of the virus with the host receptor.
This article provides a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in inter-species transfers, a recombination of SARS-CoV.
On the basis of a comparative analysis between the strains of SARS-COV and the cybetes, SARS-CoV is considered to be fast-adapted in different media, especially with respect to mutations to RSD squirrel S.
In general, the RSD of the squirrel S coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor, and the response to the antibody of the host is intensively selected.
The SARS-COV RSD is an amino acid, from 318 to 510, on a fragment of S1, which links to angiotensing enzyme 2 (APF2) of humans, as well as to their cohorts.
The SARS-CoV virus RSD can recognize APF2 receptors of different animals, including bats, civates, mice, and raccoons, making it possible to transfer the virus interspecies.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found in the RSD, which differ from human viral strains and cybetes, 4 of which are in a receptor-linked motive to interact with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-COV has mutations from K479N and S487T in the RSD, which can increase the affinity of the spine-like protein to the human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can be of particular importance in adapting the virus to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-COV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-COV.
The difference of 30 per cent between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in S1-segment squirrel leads to a change in the S-squirrel affinity to human APF2.
In fact, a study using a cryoelectronic microscope suggests that the affinity of this connection is 10 to 20 times higher than between APF2 and the S-protein of the SARS-CoV virus.
It would also be interesting to see if any other co-receivers were needed for the transfer of SARS-COV-2.
Surprisingly, HCV-NL63 also links to APF2, but to another segment of S.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as Aminopepidesis N for HCV-229E and 9-O-acetyl acid for HCV-OC43.
They can also be responsible for successfully adapting these coronaviruses to humans after inter-species transfers from animal carriers.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of the HCV inter-species transfer is also controlled by other factors of dependence and restraint of the host.
Divergence of these human-to-natural HCVs carriers, such as bats, single-row camels and rodents, can be a barrier to inter-species transfer.
For successful inter-species transmission to HCOV, it is necessary to usurp the factors of dependence and to subdue the factors of restraction of the hosts.
In this respect, molecular determinants in this important field of interaction between the virus and the host still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can result in an unbiased, full-genomic screening of the dependencies and restructuring of hosts for SARS-COV-2 with the latest CRISPR technology.
Emerging new HCOV: back to zero
The diversity of the coronaviruses of bats creates a wide range of opportunities for new HCOVs.
In this sense, the coronaviruses of bats serve as a genetic pool for HCOV.
In addition, fast mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force behind the evolution of HCOV and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among the Accensor Proteins, SARS-CoV is considered to be important for human adaptation, as the viruses of bats associated with SARS-CoV have been isolated, but have been found to codify orF8 divergent proteins.
In the strains isolated at the start of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide division was found, characteristic of the sars-CoV coronaviruses.
This division breaks OrF8 into OrF8a and OrF8b, and is considered an adaptive mutation that speeds up the change of hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gamma-coronaviruses, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
The localisation of the recombination was also defined in non-structural nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
In a similar way, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV was subject to recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single-tiered camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-COV and MERS-COV, recombinant events have also been observed in other HCOVs, where HCOV recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial breeding can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, which are likely to result from the release of the virus from the sequestration pressure, for example, from the host immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of a full-length orF4 in a prototype strain of HCV-229E due to a bi-nucleotide division.
While the Intact Open Frame of OrF4 can be observed in the viruses of the bat and the camel of HCOV-229E, the alpaca alphacoronvirus is shown by a single-nucleotide box, leading to a shift in the frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCOV is also due to the pressure of selection on their reservoir carriers.
Infected by bats with coronaviruses, there was little or no sign of symptoms, which suggests a mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It turns out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well-adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, failure in the inflammatory response of bats effectively reduces the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of the killer cells in bats has been depressed by the apregulation of the inhibitor receptor of the natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low level of expression of the molecules of the main class I complex.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen, which is provided by the high metabolic activity of bats, can stifle the replication of the coronavirus, while affecting the reading of exoribonuclease, thus creating a selection pressure to generate strains of the virus, which, when infiltrated by a new host, are highly pathogenous.
The more pathogenous strains of the coronavirus can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or the properties of the protein to adapt to the host.
So it is no accident that in the last 20 years, three new human coronaviruses have emerged.
Coronaviruses are nepatogenous or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They replicate with confidence, without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is the secret to why we see unsympathetic hosts, and what causes the grave cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with the hyperactivity of the immune response and the cytokin storm, in which the more the immune response, the more serious the lung failure.
On the contrary, the immune response of unsympathetic hosts does not involve the replication of the coronavirus.
The same anti-immune response strategy can have positive effects in anti-SARS-COV-2 therapy.
bats have a strong interferon response.
So taking type I interferon, at least in the initial stage of the SARS-COV-2 infection, should have a positive effect.
In addition, bats have been disrupted by NLRP3-inflamoma activation.
On this basis, the inhibition of NLRP3-inflamoma with MCC950 can be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-COV-2 follows the general pattern of SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
While a bat betacoronavirus has been found, whose nucleotide homology is 95% the same as SARS-COV, there is also a bat coronavirus, whose nucleotide homology is 96% the same as SARS-COV-2.
Although it has been found that liquors and other animals in the market have been able to transport viruses that are the same as SARS-COV, there have been no direct intermediates for SARS-COV-2.
Pangolin betacoronviruses were found, astonishingly homologous SARS-COV-2, which suggests that the pangolines could be one of the intermediate hosts, or that fragments of the genes of the pangoline betacoronviruses could be included in the final version of SARS-COV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by man.
The coronaviruses have attracted universal attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-COV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonic origin and HCV animal reserves in human transmission.
Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-COV, MERS-COV, and SARS-COV-2 are from bats and have been passed on to the individual via intermediate hosts.
If the SARS-CoV infection stems from contact between people and civets in the marketplace, the closing of the wild markets and the destruction of the octopus on them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of a wide range of beta-coronviruses, close to SARS-CoV-2, the Pangolines should be removed to prevent the zoonic transfer of infection from the food market.
However, whether SARS-COV-2 is passed on to humans through pangolines and other mammals, and how this can be done, remains the task of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in single-row camels.
These camels are an important vehicle, as well as a major source of meat, milk, skin and wool for the local population.
They are common in the Middle East and Africa.
So it's not possible to donate all the camels to control MERs, as was done in China's wild animal markets to prevent the proliferation of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
In order to halt the intermittent outbreaks of MERs, a comprehensive approach is needed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-COV for camels, combined with other infectious control measures.
Since we can't deal with these viruses, there may be new genes that cause outbreaks.
The world is circulating a wide range of zoonic coronaviruses.
In particular, the coronaviruses of bats with zoonosis potential are very diverse.
There is a great deal of potential for the evolution and recombination of these zoonous coronaviruses, which in the future will result in new coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and (or) more fatal to humans.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, a culture of dietary use of wild animals in some parts of China must be abandoned.
After severe tests, such as those of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better readiness and a plan to respond to such situations is needed.
In fact, there have been many viruses on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new land can be seized.
While many of the properties of bats are favorable to the spread of viruses, it is possible to minimize the risk of human contact with bats and other wild animals.
For a better understanding of the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, there is a need for continuous epidemiological surveillance of mammals, which will be useful in preventing the transfer of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks of disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent a viral zonosis is to keep people away from the ecological layers of the natural reservoirs of the zoonic viruses.
SARS-COV-2 is still missing some fragments.
First, if bats have passed the ancestors of the SARS-COV-2 virus to pangolines, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolines share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in the transfer of humans, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolines.
Finally, as many mammals, including pets, can be receptive to SARS-COV-2, both epidemiology and experimental infection should be monitored.
Whether it's a bat, a pangolin, or another mammal, it's expected that in the future, SARS-COV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified by their natural hosts.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-COV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria for “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases” COVID-19 need to be updated.
On 6 February 2020, our group published a short reference manual on the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCOV), which provides an account of our experience and valid recommendations to combat the pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; so the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
In that letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and we set out the latest diagnostic criteria for “surveillance cases” and “confirmed cases” in line with the “Recommendations on Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19” (the seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the PRC.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCov) was erupted, now officially known as coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was called the "heavy acute respirator Syndrome 2" (SARS-COV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-COV-2 infection, our group developed a short reference manual and published it on the Internet on the Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This publication has attracted a lot of attention.
Let us note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; so the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven issues of the “Recommendations on Diagnostics and Treatment for COVID-19” published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have been issued, with some of its provisions having changed considerably.
More recently, the work done by Zhou (Zhou) with the co-authors commented on our recommendations, which contained simple proposals for diagnostics based on the already available clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as valuable background information on this global pandemic.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest COVID-19 Recommendations for Diagnostics and Therapy (probable seventh version) and on-going research, their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh issue of the document (dated March 3, 2020), one element of the epidemiology history is to be combined with two clinical symptoms of the disease in order to make a full analysis of the case of a suspected disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of the movement or location of the city of Wuhan and its surroundings, or in other localities, where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded within 14 days of the symptoms; (2) history of contact with the sick persons infected with SARS-Cov-2 (with a positive test based on nucleic acid); (3) history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from the city of OWAN and its surroundings or from other localities where the case of COVID19 has been reported in the last 14 days of the symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases ( > 2 cases of high temperature or respiratory symptoms recorded in two weeks in small areas such as a home or a home, a school, a class, etc.).
Clinical: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) presence of external COVID-19 infections; (3) the total number of white blood cells is normal or lower, with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
Diagnosis for a confirmed case should be based on a suspected disease with one of the following pathogenetic or serological evidence: (1) real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-COV-2; (2) full-genomic sequencing of the virus shows a high homogeneity for new coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-COV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or a change in test result from negative to positive for SARS-COV-2 antibodies of IgG, or an increase in the type at least four times in the recovery phase relative to the acute phase.
It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) of the document, a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the airway or blood samples was added.
The pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) issues, and the seventh issue added the need for serological proof.
The changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to find the best set for the rapid detection of nucleic acids, as well as for the analysis of samples from the respiratory tracts, including blood sampling, which improves the availability of the various samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirmation of the disease.
There is, however, growing evidence of the need for care in the treatment of patients with atypical and non-symbolized symptoms.
The route map presented in the work of Zhou (Zhou) and others should therefore be updated, as it classifies persons without clinical symptoms as a low-risk group.
The evaluation system also needs to be refined in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we look forward to more direct evidence and call on readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspects of disease” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to follow up on and follow up on the most recent recommendations made in the countries in which they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, the day-to-day maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths in a day.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported 114 current cases of infection, as well as 33 recovering patients at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In online surfing, Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, told us that four men and one woman were the victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the deceased were over 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years of age, and one between 41 and 50.
She also reported that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 Pandemic.
A staff member of the clinic told the local news agency Anadole that Jalal Saifur Rahman, the director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, was one of the dead at Maitre ' s clinic in Kuwait.
On Saturday, on an online video, the Bangladeshi Minister of Road and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, stated that public transport would be cut off for a longer period than originally planned until the next Saturday.
Public transport was halted on 26 March and was due to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essentials — medicine, fuel and food — has still been authorized.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March for two people who had returned from Italy, as well as for one of their wives.
As of 19 March, the three men had already recovered.
SARS-COV-2 has crossed the millionth limit of global infections
According to Johns Hopkins University, the total number of coronavirus infections worldwide was over one million on Thursday.
The coronavirus COVID19 has killed at least 52,000 people.
The rubble was on the same day that Malawi had confirmed the first case of infection, and Zambia had recorded the first case of death from a coronavirus.
North Korea claimed that it was one of the few countries with no coronavirus infection as of Thursday.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 in the 24 hours ahead of 10:00 Central European time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were reported, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, referring to Johns Hopkins University data, reported more than 1,000 deaths due to coronavirus infection in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced a tightening of measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobyan, extended the rule of self-insulation to 1 May.
Formerly, President Wladimir Putin stated that Russians throughout the country, despite being self-sustainable, would receive their wages until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of an extension of the state of emergency for 15 days; the result of a vote was 215 in favour, 10 abstentions and one negative vote.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy towns of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while the previous curfew lasted from only 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to impose a curfew from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m.
The Governor of the state of Ohio, Mike Dewein, announced that the state's home-insulation regime was extended by order until May 1.
The shops in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian Walworths and Colles shops have reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time in all shops in the country, to two and one package, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit.
These restrictions have been reported in the cashier's ads, as well as on the Facebook page.
Reportedly, citizens have started to make emergency stocks because of the fear that COVID-19 might result in the introduction of a general self-insulation regime.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the number of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Previously, on 4 and 5 March, respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already restricted this number to 4 packages.
The Colles trade network, in a press release of March 8, reported that, with the introduction of a limit on four packages, “many shops still buy toilet paper too fast, one delivery within an hour,” and called such a demand “unprecedential,” while the AlDI on a Facebook post, published on Tuesday, called this a “unexpected trend.
According to Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
The Costaco shop in Canberra last week also restricted this number to two packages.
To make up for the shortfall, Colles began ordering larger shipments from suppliers and increasing the frequency of shipments, Woolworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made reserves for a special stock of early sales on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Ritters Association, reported that the restockers were trying to replenish the stock, but this was made more difficult by the local authorities ' restrictions on the schedule for the transport of trucks.
It was looking forward to a higher cost of products, as suppliers were trying to meet demand, but less and less favourable offers were available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, due to stock depletion, some shops were not able to share on Wednesdays.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in retail at Queensland University of Technology, said that shops restock the stock every night.
He noted that toilet paper was a bulky product, so the stock stock stock was small, and after the sale of the full volume of the product, the long rows of shelves remained empty, exacerbating a sense of stock shortages.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the shelves could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, the buyers would probably not panic so much,” says Russell Zimmerman.
In the last Wednesday, the manufacturer of the reprocessed toilet paper, Who Jeeves a Crap, reported the end of the stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, a toilet paper company, Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent brands, reported that they work 24 hours a day to ensure that there are enough items.
Domain.com, a real-estate website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne fell due to the absence of buyers during the week of Labor Day, some real-estate sellers began to offer free toilet paper to the first bidders.
The Thursday issue of NT News, published in Darwin, included a tab of eight pages to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to an ABC Australia report of March 3, shops first reluctantly imposed restrictions on the number of items to be purchased, claiming that they were not planning to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, arm disinfectants, galantery, hand-washing and flour.
In a similar way, in addition to the events in Australia, on Sunday evening, it was observed that Ocado, an online shop in the British supermarket, also restricted the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 Pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of COVID-19, caused by the Coronavirus SARS-COV-2.
Although the term “pandemic” refers only to the extent of the disease and not to the risk of specific cases, WHO notes the need for national Governments to take action:
“All countries together are still in a position to influence the evolution of the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are involved in the identification, testing, treatment, insulation, monitoring of the incidence of the disease, as well as the mobilization of their citizens,” the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tetros Adanom Gebreeus, explained.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of incidence and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedent. ”
He said in an interview on CNN in February, that “no other respirator virus other than flu has yet to be tracked from the time it was created to a continuous global spread.”
Mr. Gebreeus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international importance, and then gave it a new status, a pandemic.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fouchy, said, "This is just the beginning, it's gonna get worse."
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID19 were reported on Thursday, and more than 4,600 people died.
The Coronavirus Pandemic from 2019 to 2020 is the current coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus (SARS-COV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Ouhan, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020, an international public health emergency was declared, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate in China is 4 per cent, while in the world it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing, and difficulty breathing.
The possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress Syndrome.
The time between the first symptom and the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but it can also range from two to fourteen days.
At present, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and the preventive measures recommended include hand washing, mouth-to-mouth coughing, maintaining distances between people, and identifying and ensuring self-insulation of people suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world have responded to the situation by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk control and closures.
The pandemic has led to serious global social and economic consequences, the transfer or abolition of sporting, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as a widespread shortage of goods, exacerbated by panic shopping.
Schools and universities have been closed at the national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting some 99.4 per cent of the world ' s students.
The Internet has begun to spread misinformation about the virus, there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East and South-East Asians, or people resembling them, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where the virus is high.
As a result of the reduction in the number of trips and the closure of the heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in the city of Wuhan (Hubay), China, reported an unknown cause of pneumonia, and an investigation of the situation was launched in early January 2020.
Infectious cases were mostly associated with the Juanan seafood market, so the virus is believed to be of zoonous origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-COV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that has a large resemblance to the coronaviruses of the bat, the coronaviruses of the pangoline, and the SARS-CoV. Later it was found that the very first case of the disease occurred on 1 December 2019, and the infected person did not go to the market after that date.
Two thirds of the cases reported in December 2019 were related to this market.
On 13 March 2020, the South China office of the Morning Post, whose information was unchecked, suggested that the very first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old in Hubei province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the incidence of new infections in China had fallen but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.
The incidence of the disease can be significantly understated, in particular due to the number of cases with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, there had been relatively few cases of infection among young people, with patients under the age of 19 being less than 2.4 per cent worldwide, and the Chief Scientific Adviser of the United Kingdom, Patrick Wallons, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until effective group immunity was established.
The statistics include cases of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test was positive according to the official records.
As at 23 March, no country had been able to test more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, an official policy had been adopted not to test for mild symptoms.
A study, published on 16 March, found that, by 23 January, 86 per cent of COVID-19 cases had not been detected in China, and that such unregistered patients had become a source of infection for 79 per cent of the reported cases.
A statistical analysis, published on 30 March, showed that the number of actual cases in Italy was to a large extent higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number of infections (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the rate can be 5.7.
Most of the patients with COVID19 are recovering well.
In other, more complex cases, the time between the beginning of the symptoms and the moment of death ranged from 6 to 41 days, and the most common time was 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80 per cent of the deaths occurred in persons over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent of the deaths were related to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as the official figures may not take into account those who have not been tested — for example, in the event of death at home, in old-age homes, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID by 4 to 5 times.
The Spokesman of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: "We know that [the claimed number of deaths] is lower than the actual number." His words are backed up by reports of some isolated cases in the U.S., and this is often the case with incomplete data in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 Swine Influenza, the first confirmed death was recorded in Uhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded on 1 February in the Philippines and, outside Asia, in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions on all continents other than Antarctica had reported deaths, and more than one method was used to quantify mortality.
All indicators differ according to the region and the time of the spread of the disease; they are also affected by the levels of testing, the quality of health-care systems used, the time of the outbreak of the disease, and the parameters of the population, such as age, gender and general health status.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97,039/1,617,204).
Data differ from region to region.
In China, the mortality-to-prevalence ratio has fallen from 17.3 per cent (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the determination of the rate of disease-related deaths (CFR) — the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease and the rate of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of certain groups of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to compute these indicators for specific groups of people.
The University of Oxford Center for Evidence estimates that the overall mortality rate from this pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The top number of this range is consistent with the results of the first random test on COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO states that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact duration of the flash cannot be determined and may differ from location to location.
Matei Boni, a member of the University of Pennsylvania, states that “uncontrollable infectious outbreaks tend to go to the plateau, and then when the number of available carriers is over, they begin to fade.
In the current situation, however, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prognosis as to when this will happen.
Senior Medical Adviser to the Chinese Government, Jun Nanshan, states that “everything can be over by June” if all countries are able to mobilize and implement the WHO recommendations on measures to halt the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine announced that SARS-COV-2 would “circumvent, perhaps, within a year or two.
According to an Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine (perhaps 18 months or more) is available, physical dispersal and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, a student at the University of Vanderbilt, says, "I don't think that this coronavirus will ever go away forever, because it's so easy to pass on," and that it's "can turn into a seasonal disease, inflaming every year."
The vibration of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively unspecified, and some infected people can bear the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are elevated temperature (88 per cent) and dry cough (68 per cent).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, wetness in the airway (ilice), loss of smell, breath, pain in the muscles and joints, pain in the throat, headache, frost, vomiting, diarrhea, or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list extreme symptoms such as respiratory problems, constant pain or a sense of strangulation in the breast, a sudden sense of congestion, difficulty in awakening and blue face or lips. If there are such symptoms, you need to ask for immediate medical care. The disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distrusion, septic shock, and death.
In some infected people, the disease can run unsymptomedly, without any clinical effects, but the results of the tests confirm the fact of the infection, so the doctors recommend that those who are in close contact with patients whose diagnosis has been confirmed be placed under strict control, and that they be screened for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate the number of cases of unsymptomed currents ranged from a few to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. It is not yet fully clear about the symptom of the loss of smell: the initial estimate is that the number of patients with COVID-19 who have developed the symptom was 30 per cent, and then it fell to 15 per cent.
Some details on how the disease is spread are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as by small drops, which are released to the air with a cough, sneeze, or during a conversation; close contact means contact between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Some studies suggest that drops can be spread from 4.5 meters (15 ft) to 8.2 meters (27 ft) in open cough.
It is assumed that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops released into the air during a conversation, which can stay in the air for a longer time. Respirator drops can also be produced by exhalation, including during a conversation, although the virus is not usually airborne.
The drops can be in the mouth or nose of the people nearby, as well as in the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (CLR), can lead to the dispersion of exhalation products and, therefore, to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person touches a polluted surface, including the skin, and then touches his or her eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also fears that the virus can be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of a fecal-oral transfer of SARS-COV-2. The virus is most contagious in the first three days after the symptoms appear, although it can be spread both before the symptoms become present and at later stages of the disease.
There have been times when the tests have been positive in testing three days before the symptoms, and this suggests that the virus can be transmitted before the symptoms are expressed.
There are only a few reports of laboratoryly confirmed cases of non-symptomatic current, but contact-tracing studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from non-symptomatic carriers.
The European Center for the Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) states that it is not yet clear how easily the virus is spread, yet it is known that one patient usually infects two to three others, and the virus can survive on surfaces from hours to days.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304), the virus can live for up to three days, on the cardboard surface for one day, and on the copper surface for up to four hours.
These data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature, with positive results from COVID-19 in pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus on to people, even though the British authorities suggest washing their hands after contacting the animals, just as they do after contacting other surfaces that may have been touched by the infected.
The severe acute coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new virus found for the first time in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-COV-2 virus are found in the natural coronaviruses, and outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed with soap that dissolves its protective casing.
It is assumed to be of zoonic origin.
A genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it is genetically clustered with a species of betacoravirus, a suburb of Sarbecovrus (cell line B) in conjunction with two other strains of bat viruses.
On a holistic-genomic level, it is 96% identical to the other model of the coronavirus of the bat (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome of pangolines and humans.
A single-genomic comparison to date has shown that the highest level of resemblance (92%) is between the pangolin coronavirus and the SARS-COV-2, but this is not enough to prove that the pangolines are the intermediate hosts of the virus.
Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although it should eventually be supported by an analysis of the polymeraceous chain response with reverse transcription (RT-CPR) of an infected secret or computer tomography.
A study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Uhan found that the CT was much more sensitive than the PCR, though less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincided with other pneumonias and current disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation that “no CT be used to screen or test the first line for COVID-19.
WHO has published several RNA test protocols on SARS-COV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
A real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-CPR) is being tested.
It can be done on breathing and blood samples.
The results are usually available for a period of between hours and days.
Normally, a swab is used for the test, although a swab can also be used, and a number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them had been sufficiently precise to be approved for universal application.
In the U.S., the Cellex serology test was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The asymmetry of peripheral peripheral disturbances of the type of matt glass and the absence of pleural effluents are features of the visualization of symptoms in X-rays and CTs.
The Italian Radiological Society is in the process of drawing up an international picture of confirmed infections.
Due to similarity with other infections, such as adenovirus, in the identification of COVID-19, images not supported by PCRs have a limited clinical specificity.
In China, a major study was carried out comparing the CT results of the chest and the PCR test, and it was found that, while the images are less specific in the event of an infection, they can be deciphered more quickly; they are also more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method can be seen as a tool for screening in the contaminated areas.
In order to diagnose the virus with X-rays and CT scans, an artificially-intelligent neural network was developed.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include the maintenance of general personal hygiene, washing of hands, avoiding touch of the eyes, nose or mouth with filthy hands, and the use in coughing or sneezing of napkins, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may have already been infected should wear a medical mask in public places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that people should be physically separated from them, and many Governments recommend that they should refrain from any time-consuming visits to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and limit the movement of citizens.
Nevertheless, the virus has been able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spread to a population whose members do not know where or how it has been infected. Health care providers who may be infected are encouraged to use standard precautionary measures, as well as precautionary measures in contact with others and eye protection.
The use by Governments of data on the location of citizens through their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (Amnesty International), as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements requiring that this kind of surveillance be restricted.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working to develop solutions to ensure the confidentiality of personal data, such as recording the user's proximity to other mobile phones via Bluetooth.
If a mobile phone user was in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test was positive, he would be given notice. There are also unsubstantiated versions of how to prevent infection, such as a nose-and-mouth streak, which is actually inefficient.
So far, there are no COVID-19 vaccines, although a lot of organizations are working on it.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC (Centre for the Control and Prevention of Diseases) also recommends that hands with soap and water be washed more often for at least 20 seconds, especially after a toilet visit or severe hand contamination, as well as before food, after shrivelling, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary, as outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which opens up its protective casing.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends the use of disinfectants for hand treatment on a spirit-based basis of at least 60 per cent.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with their filthy hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated by a number of solutions (on the stainless steel surface, the disinfectant begins to function a minute after application) with a content of 62 to 71% ethanol, 50 to 100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2% to 7.5 % viadone iodine.
Other components, such as benzalconium chloride and gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in the event of a suspicion of or confirmation of COVID in an institution such as an office or a day-to-day facility, all the spaces in such a space, including rooms, toilets, public spaces, electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control and aTMs used by sick persons, be disinfected.
The health-care organizations recommend that, in the event of coughing or sneezing, the mouth and nose be covered with an elbow or a napkin, and that the use of the hygienic items be discarded immediately.
Those who may have been infected are encouraged to use medical masks, as the use of a mask can limit the volume and range of breath products that dissipate in the air when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, and touching the face with their filthy hands is the main way to infect.” Masks are also recommended for the use of those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who take care of a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of a mask does reduce the number of touches on a person.
Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public spaces.
CDC Centers, U.S.A., recommend wearing non-medical tissue face masks. China has singled out the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact with other people (1 meters (3 feet) or less.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or public spaces.
Thailand ' s health officials call on people to make facial fabric masks in their homes and to wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are not allowed to go out without masks covering their noses and mouths.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has ordered all visitors to the grocery shops to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks have been produced per day since mid-March, was ordered to use medical masks for all passengers on trains and coaches.
In Panama, residents are obliged to wear a medical mask while on the street; those who cannot buy masks are advised to sew them themselves in the home.
The medical masks are also widely used by the people of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is an anti-infection measure aimed at slowing down the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Safeguards include quarantine, travel restrictions, school closures, jobs, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distances, stay at home, limit travel, avoid public spaces, use casual greetings and physically distance from others.
Many governments in the regions, particularly those affected by the outbreak, are now ordering or recommending social distances.
The maximum number of people who can meet in one place, as recommended by U.S. government and health-care agencies, has been rapidly reduced from 250 (in regions where there was no data on COVID-19) to 50, and later to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned the grouping of more than two people. Seniors and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of contracting the virus in a serious way. CDCs recommend that they stay at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak in the region. In late March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the term “social distancing” with “physical distancing”, so the aim of this measure is to reduce physical contact in social relations, whether through virtual communication or through physical distance.
The use of the term “social remoteness” was understood in such a way that people should be subjected to total social exclusion instead of being in contact with others in alternative ways, and some agencies have issued guidelines on sexual health to be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it was recommended to have sex only with your permanent partners with whom you live, and in whom you are sure it has no virus and no symptoms.
People with COVID-19 and those who suspect that they are infected are recommended for home-based insulation.
The health-care agencies have issued detailed instructions on proper self-insulation, and many Governments have also made it mandatory or recommended that the entire population of the affected areas be placed on their own quarantine.
High-risk groups have been ordered to have the strictest quarantine.
Those who may have been in contact with COVID-19 or have recently visited a country or region heavily affected by the epidemic were encouraged to be in quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Strategies to combat the outbreak include controlling, suppressing or mitigating the spread of the disease.
The control of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and is intended to track and insulate the infected, as well as other measures of infectious control and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a time when the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are focused on mitigation: measures are being taken to slow the spread of the disease and to mitigate the impact of the epidemic on health and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can be taken at the same time.
Immunization requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections to below 1 levels. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of the infectious disease is to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as the equalization of the epidemic.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overburdening health services and allow more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to cope with the outbreak include personal prevention, such as hand-hygiene, use of medical masks and self-insulation; social measures aimed at physical remoteness, such as the closing of schools and the lifting of mass events; community involvement in and participation in such measures; and measures to protect the environment, such as surface cleaning; after the severity of the outbreak in China became apparent, more resolute action was taken to contain the outbreak, such as the isolation of entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, massive screenings and localized quarantines have been put in place, and a system has been set up to report the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to infected people who were in the process of self-insulation and imposed heavy fines on those who had not.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks has been increased and the accumulation of excess medical supplies has been fined, and the British-US model has shown that there are major challenges to mitigation (delaying, but not halting, the spread of the epidemic) and to control (stopping the epidemic).
Optimal policies to mitigate the effects of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3, and mortality by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Subjugation may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or as long as the vaccine is not developed, if it is done earlier), as otherwise the spread of the disease will resume quickly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to contain the pandemic has led to social and economic costs.
There are currently no anti-virus drugs approved for COVID-19 treatment, but efforts are under way to develop them, including the testing of existing drugs.
Taking non-receptive medicaments against colds, drinking enough liquid, and rest can help to alleviate the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, infusion of liquid, and respiration support.
The use of steroids can only harm.
Several compounds that have been previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “conventional and domestic means” can alleviate the symptoms of SARS-COV-19.
WHO views health capacity-building and adaptation to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as the main response to an outbreak.
The European Centre for the Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for primary health-care clinics and services to assist in the reallocation of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, the elimination of non-urgent procedures, where possible, for the detection of the virus and the isolation of patients with COVID-19-confirmed diagnosis, and the expansion of intensive care facilities through the training of staff and an increase in the number of available HVF and beds.
There are different theories as to where the very first case of infection may have occurred, the so-called “zero patient”.
The first known case of new coronavirus infection was probably on 1 December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China.
The number of cases of coronavirus infection in Hubei province has gradually increased over a month.
They were mainly related to the Juanan seafood market, where live animals were also sold, and one of the theories was that the virus was infiltrated by one of these animals; in other words, the virus is of zoonous origin. On 26 December, a case of massive pneumonia of unknown origin was reported at Hubei County Hospital, with which the doctor Zhang Tianjin was working, who reported the case to the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the city of Oohan on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at the city’s central clinic in Wuhan warned their colleagues about a “coronavirus similar to SARS”.
Eight of the doctors, including Lee Wenlyan, had been warned by the police of their responsibility for spreading false rumours, and a doctor, I-Fen, had been reprimanded by her superiors for raising alarm.
Later, on 31 December, the Uhan City Health Commission issued a public notice and informed WHO about the situation.
Uhan ' s health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which was high enough to initiate an investigation in early January, and at the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled about every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, thanks to Chinese New Years and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and main railroad hub.
On January 20, China reported 140 new infections in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to more recent official data, by 20 January 2020, there were 6,174 people with the disease; as at 26 March, the United States had outpaced China and Italy for the highest number of confirmed cases in the world; as at 9 April 2020, there were more than 1.61 million cases worldwide, more than 97,000 had died, and more than 364,000 had recovered.
Some 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one reported infection.
As a result of the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen zone have restricted their free movement and have put in place border controls.
National responses included measures to control the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory stay at home, compulsory shelter or isolation) and a curfew. As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, were in some form of quarantine, over 50 million in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa, and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later the figure rose to 2.6 billion, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Uhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, whose credibility was not verified, the date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Zhang Jisian, a doctor, was working on a case of massive pneumonia of an unknown type, which was reported on 27 December by her clinic to the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the city of Wuhan.
The initial genetic test of patients' samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, revealed the existence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Uhan City Health Commission issued a public notice.
WHO was notified on the same day.
In response to such notices, the police alerted the doctors in Ouhan to the responsibility for “distribution of rumours” of the outbreak.
Originally, the National Health Commission of China claimed that there was no “probable proof” of the ability of a newly discovered virus to pass from man to man.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to halt the spread of the virus, later called China’s Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping “the People’s War. ”
Events of “the largest quarantine in human history” began to unfold, and on 23 January the health border and the ban on entry to and from Wuhan was declared, and the measure was later extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
In the city, the use of private transport was banned.
In many places, the celebrations of China's New Year (25 January) have been cancelled.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Jochenshan, which was completed within 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Lakešan, was built, which received other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also reassigned 14 other institutions in Ouhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including the issuance of health certificates for travellers and the extension of the period of celebration of the Chinese New Year.
Universities and schools have been closed all over the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have put in place a number of measures, in particular for schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have put in place a remote working regime.
Travel restrictions have been imposed in the province of Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been rescheduled, and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
Many cities have put in place a regime to control the movement of citizens, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have been facing some form of outdoor restrictions, and since the outbreak entered the global phase in March, China’s authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has introduced a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city, and as of 23 March, only one case of intra-country transmission, which occurred five days earlier, has been recorded in mainland China, in this case from a person who has returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, China's Prime Minister, Li Keqiang, reported that the spread of intra-country cases had been largely halted, and the outbreak in China was under control.
On the same day, the restrictions on travel to Hubei, other than Uhan, were lifted, two months after the closure of the province to the quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that entry for persons with a visa or a residence permit would be suspended as of 28 March.
Those who want to come to China will have to apply for a visa from Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on the enterprises and the factories to resume work and provided the companies with monetary stimulus packages. On 4 April, at 10 a.m., a national “minute of silence” was held, opening a day of mourning for the victims of the coronavirus, declared by the State Council of the country and coincided with the Quinmin holiday, but the central government asked the citizens to pay their respects to the dead online, observing physical distances to avoid a re-emergence of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 was extended to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, in large part due to the large number of followers of the new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji, in Tegu.
The Shincheonji followers have come to Tegu from Uhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As at 22 February, 1,261 of the 9,336 members of the Church (about 13 per cent) reported having symptoms. On 23 February 2020, South Korea declared the highest level of alarm.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, and as early as 29 February, the rate rose to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases have been quarantined after three soldiers have been diagnosed with a virus.
The outbreak has affected the number of flights, so the flight schedule of the airlines has been changed, and South Korea has launched a program to screen the population for the presence of a virus, to track contacts, and to organize quarantine measures for contact persons, which is considered to be the largest and best organization in the world.
Screening methods included mandatory information on their symptoms via a mobile application to all those who have come from abroad, routine testing for the virus, the results of which were ready the next day, as well as increased testing capacity, which allowed for the daily testing of up to 20,000 people.
South Korea’s program is considered to be a success in the fight against the outbreak of disease, despite the fact that entire cities have not been isolated, and South Korean society has initially been divided by President Mun Jae In’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either lauded the President ' s actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for the Government ' s inadequate response to the outbreak.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in one day within four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed on a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, in South Korea on 1 April, 121 countries requested help to test for the virus.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-COV-2 in Kum, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Health Education, two people died later the same day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closing of universities, institutions of higher education and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hasan Rouhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not plan to place entire areas affected by the outbreak under quarantine, but that only individuals would be placed in quarantine.
In March, plans to limit interurban travel were announced, but the intensive movement between the cities continued before the Persian New Year.
The Shiite shrine in Kuma remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020, and Iran became the center of the virus after China in February.
Against the background of allegations of concealment of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, by 28 February more than 10 countries had linked the incidence of the disease to Iran, indicating that the level of the outbreak there might be more serious than the 388 recorded by the Iranian Government by that date.
Iran’s Parliament was shut down, and 23 of its 290 members, as reported on 3 March, found the test results for the virus to be positive.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to release unreservedly human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as to release, on a temporary basis, all prisoners eligible for this category.
The organization states that there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed institutions, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate health care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day, the highest number of deaths reported in the country since the outbreak began.
By 17 March, at least 12 active or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By March 23, Iran recorded 50 new cases of coronavirus every hour and one new death every 10 minutes from the coronavirus.
According to the WHO representative, the incidence rate in Iran can be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
It is also assumed that US sanctions against Iran can affect the country’s financial ability to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for a relaxation of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease had hit Italy when two Chinese tourists had a positive effect on the SARS-COV-2 test done in Rome.
The number of infections has been on the rise, prompting the Italian Government to halt all flights to and from China and to declare a state of emergency.
Later, an unassociated cluster of COVID-19 cases was found, starting with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardia on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 of the 11 different municipalities in northern Italy had been placed in quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "The entry into and exit from the outbreak zone will be shut down.
On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, as Italy had already recorded 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including the A series, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March, all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activity and the shut-down of businesses, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analysis, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIARTI) issued recommendations on medical ethics with regard to the priority protocols for medical care that may need to be used.
On March 19, Italy outpaced China by the death rate from the coronavirus, ranked first in the world, after announcing 3,405 deaths.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military jets with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of recovery, most of them in the Lombardia region.
One CNN report states that such a high death rate in Italy can be facilitated by a combination of two factors: a large number of the country's older citizens, and a lack of capacity to screen all who are currently suffering from the coronavirus.
The United Kingdom has responded to the virus in the quietest of all affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British Government has not required citizens to observe any form of social dispersion or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government has been criticized for not responding quickly and seriously to the danger facing the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that all non-essential travel and social contacts should be avoided, inviting people to work from the home as far as possible and to avoid public spaces such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment institutions, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and pledged to pay up to 80 per cent of the wage to working citizens, but not more than £2500 a month, as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter measures for social distances, banning the number of more than two people and limiting travel and active rest in the outdoors to cases of extreme need.
In contrast to previous measures, these restrictions have been imposed through the use of the police, the imposition of fines and the crackdown of crowds.
Most enterprises have been ordered to shut down, with the exception of those that provide “life for the population”, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, business shops, gas stations and garages.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading U.S. Government public health organization, announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Despite this, the United States population was not tested immediately, and as a result, the true level of the outbreak was hidden during this period.
Testing was hampered by the marriage of test kits issued by the Federal Government in February, by the absence of federal Government permission to use non-state test kits, which were developed by academic organizations, various companies and clinics, and by the restrictive criteria until the beginning of March, which would enable citizens to undergo a test (this could be done only for the appointment of a medical practitioner).
The Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been carried out in the United States by 27 February.
The Atlantic reported that by March 13, less than 14,000 tests had been carried out.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: “Many patients, even with symptoms and appointment of a doctor, have been waiting to be screened for hours or days.” On February 29, the first case of death from a coronavirus in the United States was reported, Governor J. Insley declared a state of emergency, which was also announced shortly by other states.
On March 3, Seattle Schools were cancelled, and by mid-March, Schools were closed all over the country. On March 6, 2020, a group of Epidemiologists from Imperial College, London, informed the United States of the forecasts of the impact of the new coronavirus on the country.

In general, the views of President Trump ' s supporters on how well he has managed to deal with the crisis have been divided.
Some officials and viewers have criticized the US’s dependence on the import of critical material, including basic items, from China.
In mid-January 2020, the Travel Median magazine published an analysis of air travel patterns, which was used to map and predict the spread of the disease.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the largest number of visitors from Uhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist destinations, Bali has been ranked the least ready for an outbreak, while Australian cities are considered to be the most well-prepared. On 7 February, Australia adopted an emergency plan for the new coronavirus (COVID-19).
In this connection, it is stated that much remains to be learned about COVID-19 and that Australia will pay particular attention to border control and communications in a threat situation.
On 21 March, a human biosafety emergency was declared in Australia.

On 5 February, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had sent their assistance to China.
Some Chinese students at American universities have come together to collect and send aid to the virus-affected regions of China, with a group from Chicago reportedly sent 50,000 N95 respirators to Hubei clinics on 30 January. Direct Relief, together with FedEx, sent an ambulance to the Uhan Union Hospital by 30 January, with 200,000 medical masks, as well as other means of personal protection, including gloves and robes.
On 5 February, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a donation of $100 million to WHO to fund the development of a vaccine and the treatment of coronavirus, as well as to protect the population of “African and South Asian risk groups” from the threat of the virus.
Interaksyon reported that on 6 February, the Chinese government donated 200,000 medical masks to the Philippines after Senator Richard Gordon sent 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.
On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it was going to send US$ 2.26 million to China.
Japan has also donated one million medical masks to Wuhan, Turkey has sent medical equipment, Russia has sent over 13 tons of medicine, Malaysia has announced a donation of 18 million medical gloves, Germany has sent a variety of medical supplies, including 10,000 protective kits, the United States has donated 17.8 tons of medicine, and has pledged $100 million in financial support to the affected countries, and after the situation in China has stabilized, the country has also sent aid to other countries affected by the pandemic.
In March, China, Cuba, and Russia sent meds and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Businessman Jack Ma sent to the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 1.1 million test kits, 6 million medical masks, and 60,000 protective suits to be distributed by the organization to its States Parties.
Later, he also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks, and 5 IVL devices to Panama.
The Czech Republic, Georgia, the Netherlands, Spain and Turkey also donated medicines to Canada.
For example, Spain has withdrawn 58,000 Chinese coronavirus test kits, with an accuracy of up to 30 per cent, while the Netherlands has withdrawn 600,000 Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also removed 100,000 unusable medical masks: they were supposed to have been manufactured in China, but later found to have come from Colombia.
On the other hand, China ' s aid was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched relief operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and to control the spread of the infection.
WHO noted a clear difference between the wake-up of atypical pneumonia in 2002 and 2004, in which the Chinese authorities were accused of seizing information, which allegedly prevented prevention and control of the spread of the disease, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central Government “regulously provided up-to-date information on the situation in order to avoid panic on the eve of China's New Year”.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to ban transport in Uhan, the WHO representative, Goden Galea, noted that, while “this measure was certainly not recommended by WHO”, it was also a “very important confirmation of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the most common place” and described it as “unprecedent in the history of public health. On 30 January, after the confirmation of the ability to transfer from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of people infected in other countries, WHO declared an international public health emergency (PHEIC), a situation that had been the sixth since 2009, when such a measure was first used during a swine flu pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tetros Adanom, said that the announcement of PHEIC was due to “the high global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without sound health systems.
Commenting on the travel restrictions, Mr. Tetros stated that “there is no reason for measures that unduly hinder international movement and trade” and that “the WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to provide $675 million in strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting on the need for urgent assistance to those countries that “do not have systems to identify people who have been infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the level of our readiness is the level of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest” and called on the international community to “make a choice: to invest today or to pay for the future.” At a press conference held on 11 February, WHO established an official name for the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, he said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide a “potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem”.
As a result, a United Nations Crisis Management Team has been set up to coordinate all United Nations responses, which, as WHO states, will “concentrate on health-care responses, while other agencies can use their experience to cope with a wider social and economic outbreak”.
On 14 February, WHO and China launched a joint ad hoc group, which provided international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in the internal management of the situation and to assess the “seriousness of the disease and its contagion”, organized seminars and meetings with key national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of the response at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that “it is too early to call the disease a pandemic, but countries must be ready to do so”.
When the outbreak erupted in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the probability of global coronavirus proliferation would be increased from “high” to “very high”, the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, warned in his statement, "This is a test for every government on the planet to be ready for a real state of affairs: it's time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be ready to do so,” and stressed that the right response can help the world to avoid a “worst scenario of events.
Ryan also stated that the current data do not justify the declaration of a global pandemic by public health officials, and he added that the declaration of a pandemic would mean that “we do indeed recognize the fact that everyone on the planet will be at risk of contracting the virus”.
On March 11, WHO declared the outbreak of the coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO was “deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high incidence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction on the problem.” WHO is severely criticized for the perceived inadequate approach to the concept of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
As a response to the current situation, Mr. Tetros Adanom, Director-General of WHO, was petitioned for his resignation, which was signed by 733,000 as of 6 April.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respect for the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Expert Group stated that everyone was entitled to take life-saving measures against him, and the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in very bad conditions, prisoners, and refugees and other unspecified groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has set up a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and recommendations.
The digital node contains information on country-to-country policy measures (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other, and promote a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and Edward Bolsonro, son of the President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, for the actions taken to combat the pandemic, which began with the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) level of the provinces have been dismissed for the quarantine measures they have taken in central China, and the dismissals have shown dissatisfaction with the political uprooting response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect China’s Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from the public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, objected to the earlier statement that the outbreak of the coronavirus had begun in Uhan, but took a side to the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 had occurred in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration called the coronavirus the “China virus” or the Uhan virus, saying that “censorship in China is only exacerbating the situation with the virus, which has now become a global pandemic,” and this has in turn been criticized by some commentators, who claim that such an approach is racist and “repels from the failure of the U.S. President’s administration to control the spread of the disease.”
The Daily Beast has access to a U.S. government telegram, which contains a communications and strategic trick, apparently made up by the National Security Council, with the following references to the strategy: "It's all in China.
We are asked to make this information available in any way possible, including press conferences and TV talk. " Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to help countries with the virus are part of the “advocative push” to get global influence.
The head of the EU’s foreign policy office, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a “geopolitic component that includes a struggle for influence through a PR and so-called policy of generosity.
Borrell also stated that “China has persistently promoted its role as a responsible and trustworthy partner, as opposed to the US”.
China also called on the US to lift the sanctions against Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, with some information to send aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned in connection with the US sanctions imposed on April 3.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of redirecting aid for other countries to their own country.
Other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy, have also been the subject of disputes with regard to medical masks.
In addition, Turkey has embezzled hundreds of SVLs for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of support for the coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, the Italian ambassador to the EU, said that “it was China alone that responded bilaterally.
This is not a clear sign of European solidarity.
On March 22, following a phone call to Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the transport to Italy of Russian military paramedics, specialized disinfective transport and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “high-level political source”, claiming that 80 per cent of Russian aid was “unhelpful or of little use to Italy.
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a positive impression on the world public at the “geopolitic and diplomatic” level.
The President of Lombardia, Attillo Fontana, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Mayo, rejected the media attacks and expressed their gratitude for the assistance.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
The Spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Pescow, stated that “by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] presumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials grow up, they will also be able to respond when needed.
The NATO Defence 2020 military exercises planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO post-cold-war military exercises, will be conducted in a shortened format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, has criticized the Defender 2020 (Protector 2020) exercise: “In the current public health crisis, these exercises threaten not only the lives of the US military and many European member countries, but also the people of the countries in which such events are to take place.” Iran’s Government has been severely affected by the virus, infected by about two dozen members of Parliament, as well as 15 other current or former politicians.
On March 14, 2020, Iran’s President, Hasan Rouhani, in an open letter, asked world leaders for help, reporting that his country was experiencing difficulties in fighting the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets due to the US sanctions against Iran, and the epidemic had led to calls for the United States to adopt a social policy that was common to other rich countries, including the introduction of a unified system of health care and care, paid family leave and increased public health financing.
Politologists expected that this might have a negative impact on Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential elections, and the pandemic has made the diplomatic relationship between Japan and South Korea worse.
South Korea criticized Japan's “undefined and passive quarantine measures” after Japan announced that any South Korean citizen would be placed in a two-week quarantine in government-specific locations.
South Korean society was first divided by President Mun Jae-jin's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either lauded the President ' s actions or called for Mr. Moon ' s impeachment for the Government ' s perceived inadequate response to the outbreak of the disease, and the pandemic has led countries to adopt emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this step will enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, the Parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Victor Orban the permanent right to rule by decree, to suspend the work of Parliament, and to hold elections and punish those who would be accused of disseminating the viral information and the Government ' s response to the crisis.
The outbreak of the coronavirus was cited as the cause of a number of supply shortfalls due to the global increase in the use of anti-epidemic equipment, the acquisition of goods in a state of panic and the disruption of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings of a shortage of drugs and medical equipment, due to an increase in consumer demand and a failure in the performance of suppliers.
There have also been panic shopping in several localities; this has led to the loss of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which in turn has led to a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tetros Adanom, the demand for individual protection has grown 100fold.
This leap has led to a 20-fold increase in prices over the normal price, as well as a four- to six-month delay in the delivery of medical supplies.
It has also led to a shortage of personal protection facilities around the world, and WHO has warned that health-care workers will be at risk for this reason.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, Daigo buyers have been given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This activity has led to a lack of infant food in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Government of Australia. Despite the high incidence of COVID-19 in North Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food, food shortages in both areas have been avoided.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation and illegal trade in critically important products, which have been successful, have prevented the acute food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
North Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced a major setback, but in the view of the industry, the price of agricultural production can rise.
The shelves of food shops remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork to ensure that the population was well fed.
Similar laws require food producers to conserve food supplies in the event of an emergency exist in Italy.
The damage to the world economy has affected China: according to the media of 16 March, China’s economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 by government measures to combat the spread of the virus, which has led to a 20.5 per cent decline in retail sales.
Mainland China is a major economic and production centre; a viral outburst is therefore considered to be a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agatha Demari, a member of the Economic Intelligence Unit, predicted that market volatility would continue until a better picture of the potential results became available.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic on global growth could outperform the effects of the 2002–2004 SAR epidemic.
An expert from the University of Washington in St. Louis estimated that the cost of the world supply chain could be over $300 billion, and the negative impact could last for up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reportedly begun to take “emergency measures” after a sharp fall in oil prices due to a fall in demand from China.
On 24 February, global stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to the growing fear of a coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indexes, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and Dow Jones index for industrial companies, have shown the sharpest fall since 2008, with the Dow index falling by 1,191 points, the largest one-day fall in the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indexes showed a more than 10 per cent drop.
On February 28, Scape Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
The stock fell again due to fear of the spread of the coronavirus, and the largest fall occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is a risk of an economic recession.
The economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks are more responsive than in the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in connection with the ban on movement, the closure of public spaces, including tourist attractions, and the recommendation of Governments not to make any travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to a sharp drop in the demand for airfare, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British Flybe Regional Airlines has ceased to exist.
The negative effect on the Cruise Lines industry has been as strong as ever.
Several rail stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-June, the main tourist season of China's New Year's celebrations.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of events involving a large number of people, including the annual New Year's Festivals; private companies have also closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year ' s events had been cancelled, and the tourist attractions had been closed to prevent mass gatherings of people; for example, Beijing had closed the Forbidden City and the traditional Temple Fairs had been abolished.
In 24 of China ' s 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, the authorities extended the New Year ' s holiday until 10 February, instructing most enterprises not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
The Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level, and have declared an emergency, closing the school by March and cancelling the New Year’s celebrations, and the retail sector has been affected on a global scale: shop hours have been shortened, and some shops have been temporarily closed.
Visits to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America fell by 40 per cent.
Sales in North America and the Middle East have been cut by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, in March, the attendance of shopping centres fell by 33-43 per cent compared to February.
The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that the Latin American recession caused by the pandemic can leave 14 to 22 million more people out of poverty than it would in a similar situation but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the epidemic in Ouhan, some 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers found themselves at home in their own country or locked up in Hubei Province, and in March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought the Government ' s help.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates that in the United States, the outbreak of coronavirus can rob 47 million people of their jobs and the unemployment rate can be 32 per cent. Self-sustainable measures introduced in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers who receive daily pay out of work. A study by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44 per cent of Canadian households have in one way or another been facing unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for a temporary unemployment benefit, while 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit, and almost half a million companies in Germany moved their employees to a Government-subsidized short-term work schedule, part-time.
The German part-time wage scheme has also been introduced in France and the United Kingdom.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations, as well as of individuals, whether officially employed or independent, all over the world.
Organizations of culture and art have tried to support their (often State-funded) mission to ensure access to the cultural heritage for the community, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, as well as, if possible, supporting the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been shut down for an indefinite period, or had been restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and performances had been cancelled or rescheduled.
In return, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, with another recent and growing result of the spread of the virus, such as the abolition of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered a setback, and the Vatican announced the cancellation of the Festival of the Good Week in Rome, which is being held in the last week of the Christian penitent period, the Great Post.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and do not attend Sunday services; in some churches, church services have begun to be broadcast on radio, live or on television, while some church leaders have offered to hold outdoor worship.
The Roman-Catholic diocese of Rome closed down its churches, chapel and St. Peter Square, where Christian Pilgrims are no longer present, and later other religious organizations have also abolished worship and restricted access to public worship in the churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gourrows.
The Ministry of Health of Iran has announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak of the coronavirus, and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia has banned the access of foreign pilgrims and its own residents to the shrines of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sporting events since World War II.
Most of the major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA League of Champions 2019-20, the Premier League 2019-20, the Euro-2020 UEFA, the NBA 2019-20 season and the NHL 2019-20 season.
The outbreak of the coronavirus also destroyed the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “post-2020, but not later than the summer of 2021.” Casinos and other gaming institutions around the world have been closed down, and poker tournaments, which are usually aired live, have also been either rescheduled or cancelled.
This has led many players to go online, and many of the gaming sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, and the entertainment industry has also suffered, as various music groups have halted or cancelled concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway, have also cancelled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for the continuation of their activities and the sharing of their results on the Internet, and to organize live live online concerts or web festivals; this has helped people in creative professions to continue to do, publish or publish their work.
There are a lot of Internet memos on the subject of the coronavirus, many of which are humorous and soothe the anxiety of the periods of uncertainty.
Since COVID19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese and East Asian citizens, as well as against the people of hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
There have been instances of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
Information for February (where most cases of infection are still restricted to China) revealed racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese nationals who allegedly deserve the virus or have been justly retaliated for anything.
In some African countries, anti-Chinese sentiments are also on the rise.
Many residents of Ouhan and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Support was provided to Chinese citizens, as well as to people living in virus-affected areas, both offline and online.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, in particular Italy, the first country in Europe to face a major outbreak of COVID-19; in this regard, citizens of such regions may also begin to be affected by suspicion and xenophobia, and citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed an early petition to prohibit Chinese nationals from entering their countries in order to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComToJapan (#Chinese Don't Come Japan) has been leading Twitter.
Chinese, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report a growing level of racist sentiments and even attacks.
US President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus “the Chinese virus; critics think it is racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Uhan to New Sanjara.
Students from North-East India bordering China and studying in the major cities of India reported cases of persecution related to a coronavirus outbreak.
Dileep Ghosh, President of the State Division of Bharatiya Janata Party, Western Bengal, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “so God retaliated upon it. ”
Later, these remarks were denounced by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, who called them “misguided.” In China, the pandemic rekindled xenophobia and racism against non-Chinans: foreigners were called “foreign trash” and objects to be “removed”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many academic publishers have made available their scientific articles on the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their research on the printers' publishing servers, such as bioRxiv.

The smuggling of wild animals and diseases from animal to humans is a health risk associated with the trade in exotic animals.
The laboratory test of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-COV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the presence of the virus and methods for detecting antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the OTCR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
The test is specific and is designed to detect only the SARS-COV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm relatively recent or active infections.
Antibodies (serology) can be found for both diagnosis and population control.
Tests on antibodies reveal the number of people who have been sick, including those whose symptoms were too small to be treated in a hospital or not at all.
The exact rate of death due to this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined from such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the incidence of the virus among the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to test more than 3 per cent of its population, and information on the number of tests carried out in different countries was very contradictory.
Such differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on the recorded mortality rate, which in some countries may be significantly overstated.
By means of a polymeraceous chain-reaction real-time inverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on a sample from the respiratory tracts obtained in a number of ways, including a swab or a sample of wet.
The results are usually available for a period of between hours and two days.
The OT-PRR test on swabs taken from the throat is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can vanish from the throat, but it can continue to breed in the lungs.
Infected patients tested in the second week of the disease can alternatively take material from the lower airway using a suction catheter, or use refrigerant (nail).
An early PCR test was developed at the Charit Hospital, Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymeraceous real-time reflex chain (rRT-PCR) and was the basis for 250,000 sets, which were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On January 28, 2020, Kogenebiotech, a South Korean company, developed a kit for the detection of SARS-Cov-2 based on the PCR at a clinical level (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
It identifies the "E" gene common to all beta-coronaviruses, and the "RdRp" gene specific to SARS-COV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group was one of the first companies to get permission from China's National Drug Administration to use the SARS-Cov-2 detection kit on the basis of PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes, through the International Regent Resource, their real-time diagnostic panel for RPT-PRCs (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from the older versions of the test set produced incomplete results due to defective reagents and a narrow area of testing by CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using the two components were not considered robust until 28 February 2020, and only after that date were State and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
Testing was approved by the Food and Medicines Watch as part of an emergency application, and US commercial labs began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing COVID-19 on the basis of RT-PRCs throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing on COVID-19 throughout the country on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been declared; the abstraction and processing of the analyses should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and carried out by the State Center for Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Public Health Watch, and it was reported that on March 12, 2020, the Mayo clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA to use a test that can be run within 3.5 hours on a large number of samples, allowing one car to process some 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency application (EUA) to Abbott Labs to test the Abbott m2000 system; earlier the FDA issued a similar permission to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fischer Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the EUA from the FDA for a test of about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test using amplification of insulated nucleic acids instead of the PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of variable-temperature cycles, this method can produce positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott is planning to expand production to 50,000 tests a day, and Taiwan is currently developing a test using monoclonic antibodies, which is uniquely linked to the nucleocapsid squirrel (N-squirrel) of the new coronavirus, and there is a hope that it will be possible to get the results in 15 to 20 minutes, like a flu test.
A March 2020 study of specialized literature concluded that “the breast-retgenograms have a small diagnostic value at an early stage, while the results of the CT [computer tomography] can be of such value even before the symptoms appear”.
Typical features identified during the CT include two-way multi-pronged sub-tribal condensation tricks of the type of "matter-glass" with peripheral, asymmetrical and a posterior distribution.
Sub-plural domination, the symptom of a rocky bridge, and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
A study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Uhan at the time of the current pandemic found that the CT was much more sensitive than the PCR, though less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincided with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation that “no CT be used to screen or test the first line in COVID-19.
Part of the immune response to the infection is to produce antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infections in humans after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity, and to carry out population control, and can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or by on-site diagnosis (PoCT)
In many clinical labs, these tests will be able to run high-productive automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
A single peripheral blood sample is usually used in CLT, although serial samples can be used to track the immune response.
At the PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by piercing each cover.
In contrast to the PCR, the blood-absorption phase is not required to take a test tube. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have completed all the necessary registration procedures and can now expand their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, the FDA had approved only one emergency application test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun medicinal Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics had obtained European permission to use their test set, which can be found in the blood samples of IgG and IgA antibodies.
The test output is several hundred samples for a few hours, and therefore the method works much faster than the normal PCR analysis of the viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the infection, and in early April, Britain found that none of the antibodies test kits it had acquired had produced satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been set up to enable patients with suspicion of the virus to stay at home: “the emergency services are handing over a sample tube to the patient,” the patient spits it out, and after a while gets the results of the test. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot program to test suspicious cases in the home, which removes the risk of infection by the patient of other patients in the clinic, or the need to disinfect the ambulance if it is used to transport the patient.
Express testing centres helped South Korea to set up one of the fastest and most extensive test procedures in any country. On 2 March, in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Doctors stated that it was ready to do about 12,000 tests a day in outpatient conditions, and a week earlier, it was only possible to do 10,700 tests a week.
If the examination is appointed by a doctor, the cost is covered by the health insurance.
According to the president of the Institute, Robert Koch, Germany's overall test performance is 160,000 tests a week.
As at 19 March, a rapid test was proposed in a number of major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study found that, as of calendar week 12/220 on SARS-COV-2, a total of at least 483,295 tests had been taken, up to and including the week of 12/220, and 33,491 (6.9 per cent) of the result was positive. Researchers at the Israeli clinics Technion and Rambam Hospital have developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, merging the samples and carrying out further tests only if the combined sample proves to be positive. On 5 February 2020, BGI opened a temporary laboratory of 2,000 square meters to detect an emergency called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese or "Fire eye"), which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
The construction of the laboratory was organized by the founder of the BGI van Jian and completed in just five days; the simulation showed that if the laboratory had not been put into service at such an accelerated rate, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would have been 47% higher, and the cost of the quarantine would have been double.
The Huo-Yang labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai were immediately opened after the opening of the lab in Uhan.
By March 4, 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day, and open multi-plex Origami Assays were released, which can test up to 1,122 COVID19 tests using only 93 test tubes. Such balanced designs can work in small labs, excluding the use of robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, due to a shortage of reagents, mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom, and the United States had become a problem.
As a result, some authors have referred to test-testing protocols, which provide for the heating of samples at 98°C (208°F) within 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the volume of testing for the coronavirus currently being carried out by the United Arab Emirates per capita was higher than that of any other country, and that a large part of the population will soon be tested.
This was the result of rapid testing, along with the acquisition of a mass-test laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (created on the basis of their Huo-Yang emergency detection labs in China).
This laboratory, which has been deployed in 14 days, is able to run tens of thousands of RT-PRCs a day, and is the world's first lab on such a large scale, operating outside China.
Different test options for different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of the test kit, which is sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own kit.
The German version was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States health and epidemiology centres was not available until January 28, which led to a lack of test kits in the United States. At the start of the outbreak, China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits, and those countries, as well as Australia, were not able to provide sufficient sets recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts say that the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For a number of years, the South Korean government has been working to provide testing facilities, mostly in private labs.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the scaling up of testing programmes as the best way to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the growing demand for testing due to the rapid spread of the virus, many of the United States private labs, which received hundreds of thousands of test samples, were overloaded, and the stocks of swabs and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kit.
The American test kit developed by CDC had “disadvantages”, and for this reason the government removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the private development of the test, and Spain purchased the test kit from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co. Ltd, but found that the results of the test set were inaccurate.
The firm explained that the reason for the inaccuracy of the results might be the failure to take samples or the misuse of the set.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would pull off the set that gave the wrong results, and replace it with other sets, the Shenzchen Bioeasy. 80 per cent of the test set that the Czech Republic had acquired in China had not produced the right result. The 1.2 million test sets that Slovakia had acquired in China had also been found to be inaccurate.
Atesh Kara, a member of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had a “high level of error” and the Ministry“ did not use them. ” The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was declared unfit for use.
Quantitative measures for those whose tests had been positive on SARS-COV-2, as well as the monitoring of the people with whom such patients had been in contact, have had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaud, where the first man in Italy dies of COVID-19, conducted two test cycles for the total population of about 3,400 at about 10 days.
About half of the people with a positive result had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases had been placed in quarantine.
The entry to the locality had been closed, and the measure had completely halted the spread of the infection.
In the context of intensive monitoring of contact, entry, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 Coronauviras Pandemie in Singapore was much less strained than in other developed countries, and extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and shops have not been imposed.
Many of the events there were cancelled, and on 28 March Singapore began to urge the residents to stay at home, but the schools that ended on 23 March opened on schedule.
A number of other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also coped with the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contact, entry, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions have been less aggressive.
A statistical study has shown that in countries where more tests have been carried out than the number of deaths, the mortality rate has been much lower, probably because they have been able to identify more patients with low or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without the resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first 10 negative test results to COVID-19 in one of the 16 WHO control laboratories for validation testing.
Seven of the 16 control labs are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America, and one in Australia.
In the next graph, the column's column's performance is dependent on a country-specific test policy.
A country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher rate of success than a country in which all citizens are tested, irrespective of the presence of symptoms of the virus, under the same conditions.
Hand washing, also known as a hand hygiene, is a process of hand purification to remove contaminants, fat, microorganisms, or other harmful substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted in a fecal-oral way.
A person can also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common cold, for example, if he touches the eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e. mucous) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day, after which the hands with soap should be washed: before and after defecation, after washing of the child's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the sick person's care.
After changing diapers or washing a child to the toilet.
After sneeze, cough, or sneeze.
After touching animals, feeds, or wastes of animal origin.
Hand-hygiene refers to hygienic actions related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before taking drugs or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical aim of washing the hands is to clean up the hands of pathogens (bacteries, viruses or other micro-organisms that can cause disease) and of chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for those who cook or work in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
Hand washing is very good for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents contagious types of diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces the rate of infant mortality in domestic births.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing can result in a slight acceleration of the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by using simple habits, such as hand-washing with soap.
This basic procedure has the potential to reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders of the use of hand washing can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefit of low-income clean water.
A 48% drop in the number of cases of diarrhea can be associated with the washing of hands with soap. Soap washing is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (PRSs), provided that appropriate habits are developed in every home, in schools, and in other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of the RSI, is the main cause of death among children under the age of five, which kills about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia in general kill almost 3.5 million children a year.
The United Nations Children’s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after a solid toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the mortality from diarrhea by almost half, and death from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out under water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Handwashing also prevents impetigo – a disease that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small negative effect of frequent hand washing is that it can result in the drying of the skin, and, in fact, in its damage.
A 2012 Danish study found that too much washing of hands can lead to a soot and skin swelling – a disease known as eczema or dermatitis, which is particularly common among health-care workers.
Too frequent washing of hands can also be considered a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal oral transmission of the disease: after being emptied (feeding, defecation), after washing a child's buttocks (shifting diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases in which a hand should be washed to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after the treatment of the cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or shrivelling, after contacting the waste of an animal or an animal, after contacting the trash.
Hand-washing with soap is not common in many countries.
A 2015 study on hand washing in 54 countries found that, on average, 38.7 per cent of families used to wash their hands with soap was a common practice. A 2014 study found that the highest rate, 97 per cent, was found in Saudi Arabia; the US was in the middle of the list, 77 per cent; the lowest rate was found in China, 23 per cent. There are currently a number of methodologies for behavioural change and the creation of the habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group hand washing among school children at the right time of the day is one such methodology that helps to train children to do so.
The “Emergency Care Programme”, implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines, is an example of a wide-ranging effort to improve children's health and education.
The national programme is based on deworming, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily soap washing and daily fluorine brushing.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from skin cover is more effective if soap or washing is added.
The main action of soap and detergents is to remove the barriers to solubility and to raise the level of solubility.
Water in itself is not considered an effective means of skin purification, as the fats and proteins that are components of organic pollution are not soluble in water.
Sufficient water, however, contributes to the clean-up process.
Solid soap, due to repeated use, can also contain bacteria that can be found on it in previous use.
A small number of studies on the skin cover of bacteria from a polluted piece of solid soap suggest a low probability of such a fall, as the bacteria are washing away with the foam.
The CDC still states that “liquid soap with a hand-dosing device is the preferred option for washing hands”.
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in health-care communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of the recommended anti-septic or disinfectant means has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by their nature.
But antibacterial soap contains common anti-bacterial agents, such as triclozane, to which many resistant strains of organisms are persistent.
Thus, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not selective in relation to anti-bacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be in line with the advertising.
In addition to the surface-acting substance and skin protection, complex compounds can contain acids (acetic, ascorbic, dairy) as a controller for pH, as well as anti-microbial active benzoic acid and other swellings (alone belief, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). An integrated analysis by the University of Oregon Public Health School has shown that, in terms of prevention and removal of bacteria from the skin, simple soaps are as effective as common antibacterial soap containing triclozine.
Hot water is still not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
The bacteria reproduce much faster at a body temperature of 37°C.
However, for the removal of natural fats, containment of pollution and bacteria, warm soap water is more effective than cold water.
Contrary to popular opinion, research has shown that the use of warm water has no effect on the reduction of the microbial burden on the arms.
Hand disinfectant (sanitizer) or hand antiseptic is a hand-hygienic without water.
In the late 1990s and in the early 21st century, the use of non-water hand-hygienic means (also known as disinfectant hand-to-hands, antiseptic hand disinfectants or sanitizers) began to grow.
Most of these means are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with clotting, such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) as gel, or humidifiers such as glycerine in liquid or foam form, which makes it easier to use these means and reduces the effect of the drying of the skin with alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity, and disinfectants containing at least 60-95% of alcohol are effective in the eradication of germs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), a TB stick, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70% of alcohol kill 99.97% of the bacteria (the 35-decibel reduction logarithm) on their arms 30 seconds after use, and 99.999% of the bacteria (the 4-5 reduction logarithm) on their arms 1 minute after use. Hand disinfectants are the most effective against the bacteria and are less effective against some viruses.
Disinfectants on an alcohol-based basis are virtually inefficient against viruses of the noroviral (or Norwalk) type, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.
The face and back of the two palms, as well as the space between the fingers over the entire length of the fingers, are swept for about 30 seconds until the liquid, the foam, or the gel is fully absorbed.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a choice in hand washing, not the use of disinfectants, especially when the hands are heavily polluted.
The growing popularity of such disinfectants is due to the simplicity of their use and the rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be a substitute for full hand washing if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of hand disinfectants on a spirit basis can cause the skin to dry if their composition does not contain the softening agents and (or) the humidifiers of the skin.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and (or) other softening agents to the agent.
In clinical trials, hand-to-hand disinfectants containing softening components caused much less irritation and dryness than soap or anti-microbial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact Syndrome or hyperresponsibility to alcohol or additives present in disinfectant means are virtually non-existent.
The lower probability of an irritant contact dermatitis has become a factor in the choice of disinfectants as compared to soap and water.
Despite their efficiency, non-water means do not purge their hands of organic matter, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that disinfectants are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens as common soap and water, as the use of such means still leaves pathogens in their hands.
The efficiency of the disinfectant for non-alcohol hands depends to a large extent on the components and composition, and has historically been much lower than in alcohol or alcohol.
More recently, it has been shown that drugs that use benzalconium chloride have persistent and cumulative anti-microbial activity, as opposed to alcohol, which has been shown to be deficient after multiple use, probably due to progressive by-effects of skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ashes or clay.
Ash or clay can be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or ash is polluted by micro-organisms, this can, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, the ash is a disinfectant, as it produces a alkaline solution in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends the use of ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent contamination, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommend the use of hand-washing, including the following steps:
Spread your hands under warm or cold running water.
It's just running water that's recommended, because standing water can be polluted, and the water temperature just doesn't matter.
Wash your hands with a lot of soap, including the back of your palms, as well as the dots between your toes and under your fingernails.
Soap removes germs from their skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap (not just one water).
Trim your arms for at least 20 seconds.
The tremors help to remove the germs from the skin, and the longer you do, the more germs are removed.
Spread your hands carefully under current water.
Spraying hands in standing water can cause re-infection.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry on your own.
Wet and wet hands are more easily polluted, and the most common areas are the thumbs, the wrists, the arms between the toes and the fingernails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
Frequently, it is recommended to use wettening lotion to prevent the drying of the skin of the hands, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If current water and soap are not available, there are a number of inexpensive ways to wash their hands: water from a hanging jerrican or a bottleneck with holes and (or) the use of ash, if necessary, as is the case in developing countries. Water saving solutions, such as foot taps and other inexpensive options, exist in places with limited water supply (e.g., in schools or in rural areas in developing countries).
A crane with a foot pedal is a simple design made up of a container hanging on a rope, and a foot lever to be pressed to get water on its arms, and a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand-drying is an integral part of the hand-hygienic process, but there is some controversy about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
The growing volume of research has shown that paper towels are much hygienicer than the electric hand-dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was carried out by the University of Westminster in London, co-sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Servants and Towels, to compare the hygienicity of paper towels, hand-dryers with warmer air and more modern air-drying air-dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying the hands in a hot-air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips was an average of 194 per cent and 254 per cent on the palms.
It also turns out that after washing and drying their hands in an air-flowed dryer, the total number of bacteria on their fingers is increasing by 42%, and on their palms by 15%.
After washing and drying with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips is on average down to 76 per cent, and on the palms to 77 per cent.
A stroke-air dryer that delivers air at a rate of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph) can drain micro-organisms from his hand and from his own block and can potentially infect other users of the toilet and toilet within a radius of up to 2 m.
The use of hot-air hand dryers spreads micro-organisms within a radius of up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, TUV Produkt und Umwelt carried out a study to evaluate the various methods of hand-drying.
There are the following changes in the number of bacteria, depending on the method of hand-drying:
There are many different hand-dryers, and hand-dryers are compared to a dryer with paper towels.
Hand-cleaning with disinfectant napkins can be an alternative solution to travel without soap and water.
Hand disinfectant on a spirit basis must contain at least 60 per cent of the alcohol.
The medical method of washing the hands became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignatz Semmelweis found it to be very effective (in 1846) in the prevention of disease in an insidious environment.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget it.
According to one study, the use of such devices does help to reduce the level of infection.
The medical washing of hands lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and wash each part of the hand.
Hands should be shrewd carefully against each other by crossing their fingers.
If you have dirt under your fingernails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since germs can stay in the water on their hands, it is important to wash them well and clean up with a clean towel.
After drying, closing the crane and, if necessary, closing and opening any door, a paper towel should be used.
This prevents re-pollutation of hands from these surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in health-care facilities is to remove pathogens (microbes) and to prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most health-care facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before they touch their patients, and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the flow of blood associated with the use of the catheter by 66 per cent, and the World Health Organization has published a leaflet showing the standard method of washing and hand-hand handling to be used in the health sector.
The WHO draft manual on hand-hygiene is also available on its website and open to public discussion.
The review was co-sponsored by Whitby.
If proof of compliance is required, commercial devices may be used to measure and check the hand-hygienic performance.
The World Health Organization means “five points” when it is necessary to wash your hands:
After contact with blood or biological liquids,
before the use of antiseptics, and
Adding anti-septic chemicals to soap in hand washing ("medicine" or "anti-microbial" soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such anti-bacterial properties may be needed before performing surgery or in a high-level antibiotic-resilient environment. The “cleaning” of the hands before the surgery requires a crane, which can be turned on and off without touching it, and the use of a bit of chlor-hexidine or iodine water to wash your hands, sterile hand-washing towels after washing, a sterile wrinkle, and another sterile instrument to clean under your fingerna.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to rub your hands for too long, like 10 minutes.
The water with the forearm should not fall back on the hand.
After the washing has been completed, the hands are dried with sterile tissue and put on a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or to use antiseptic handwork before and after care procedures.
In order to combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20 per cent of washing was the best use, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the hand washing rate was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared to the washing of anti-bacterial soap, hand washing with normal soap results in more than threefold increases in the incidence of bacterial contagious diseases transmitted through food, a comparison of hand washing with alcohol and hand washing with anti-bacterial soap, an average of 30 seconds per procedure, showed that hand treatment with alcohol-containing solution reduced the bacterial contamination by 26% compared to anti-bacterial soap.
But soap and water are still more effective than hand-to-hand alcohol in reducing the number of flu virus A H1N1 and the Clostridium Difphylium dispute.
More research is needed on the most effective type of intervention in the various health-care facilities.
In developing countries, hand-washing with soap is considered a cost-effective and important means to improve health and even digestion.
However, the lack of stable water, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to instill a habit of regularly washing hands.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, not every private or public toilet has hand-washing cranes, although there are low-cost ways of doing hand-washing in such places.
Lack of hand hygiene, however, can also be due to insidious habits, not to a lack of soap or water.
The promotion and stimulation of hand-washing with soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing, and lead to long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate the results.
A system-wide analysis of 70 studies has found that, in order to improve the position of hand-washing in lower-middle-income countries, effective community-level health and epidemic surveillance is effective, while public marketing campaigns are less effective, and one example of advocacy on hand-washing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's "Three Star Approach" approach: it promotes simple cost-effective measures in schools to encourage student hand-washing with soap, as well as other hygienic requirements.
By meeting minimum standards, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.
Installation of handwashers is one of the possible measures taken in the context of the hands-hygienic information campaigns to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
The Global Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at behavioural change. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of emojis to symbolize hand washing.
Some studies considered the overall efficiency of hand-washing in developing countries in comparison with the DALYs (maintened years of life without disabilities).
One study, however, suggests that the stimulation of hand-washing with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for vulnerable groups such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the middle of the 19th century as two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse, and the “founder of modern care for the sick.
At the time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by rotting smells called myasms.
In the 1980s, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have become more active in the promotion of hand-hygiene as an important measure to prevent infection.
As a result of the outbreak of pork flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with “the right hand washing techniques” were placed next to hand washing in public toilets, as well as in office and airport toilets.
The phrase “wave your hands” means an expression of their unwillingness to take responsibility for anything or to be a party to something.
It is derived from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate “was wringing his hands ” when making the decision to crucify Jesus Christ; it was later used more widely in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's play "Macbeth", Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands unwittingly in an attempt to cleanse the imaginary stain that symbolizes an unclean conscience in connection with the crimes that she has committed and prompted her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people who remember or observe an unethical act tend to wash their hands more often than others, and handwashers are more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who have been able to wash their hands after what they see will be involved in any other “cleaning” compensatory activities, such as volunteering.
In religions, hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. The symbolized washing of hands with water but without soap is part of the rite of many religions, including Baha ' i, Hinduism, tevilah, and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Woodhu in Islam, and it also prescribes hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require hand washing after going to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after every meal.
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 means the application of safety and health-care techniques to control risk and control the coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper control of workplace risks depends on place and work, based on risk assessment, the severity of the epidemic in the community, and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Office of Labor and Industrial Health (OSHA) reported that posts with lower risk levels have minimal professional contact with the public and their peers, and in such cases basic measures are needed to combat infection, including hand-washing, encouraging workers to stay at home with signs of illness, observing respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfecting the working environment.
Medium-risk posts require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, but are likely to be infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international visits.
This category may include workers in contact with the public, such as in schools, a high-density working environment and some major retail shops.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic prevention measures, include air-conditioning with high-efficiency air filters, screens and accessible personal protections in the event of contact with a person with COVID-19.
OSHA is of the view that health-care and morgue staff who have been in contact with a person with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection are in the category of high risk, with the risk being raised to a very high level in the course of an aerosol procedure or the collection/handling of samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk-management measures appropriate to such staff include the use of safety and safety equipment, such as negative-pressure vents, as well as personal protections suitable for the task.
An outbreak of COVID-19 can have a variety of effects at the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work due to their own illness, the need to take care of others, or fear of possible contagion.
Business templates can change in terms of both the type of goods for which there is a demand and the way in which such items are purchased (e.g., purchases in non-peak periods with delivery or maintenance without getting out of the car).
Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Plan for Epidemic Preparedness and Response can be used in the organization of protection.
The plans address the risks associated with the various workplaces and tasks, including the sources of infection, the risk factors at home and in the community, as well as the risk factors of individual workers, such as old age or chronic diseases.
The plans also identify the monitoring tools needed to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may result from the epidemic.
Plans to prepare for and respond to the epidemic can be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the goals of the response to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, to protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, to maintain business operations and to minimize the negative impact on other organizations in their supply chains.
The response is affected by the severity of the disease in the business community.
The hierarchy of risk control tools is a structure that is widely used in occupational safety and health to group such means according to efficiency.
If the risk of COVID-19 cannot be addressed, the most effective means of safety and security are the administrative measures and, finally, the means of personal protection.
Engineering security means that staff are excluded from work-related risk sites and do not rely on the employee ' s behaviour, which can be the most cost-effective solution.
The administrative measures include changes in the working policies or procedures that require action by the employee or the employee.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help to address some of the risks.
All types of personal protection must be selected according to the threat to the worker, be sized (e.g. respirators), be used at all times and properly, be regularly checked, maintained in proper condition and replaced as necessary, and be properly filmed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Office of Labor and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) believes that the lowest-risk positions have minimal contact with the public and their peers.
The basic response to the epidemic, which is recommended for all workplaces, includes frequent and careful hand-washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with respiratory etiquette, including hand-coughing and sneeze, provision of napkins and garbage containers, readiness for remote or replacement work, as appropriate, for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of persons who may be potentially affected is a critical step in the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises staff with acute respiratory symptoms to stay at home until the heat stops, no high body temperature, and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-free or other medications to address the symptoms, and also requires flexibility in the health-care policy, to allow staff to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and to ensure that staff are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed data or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a risk of SARS-COV-2 infection due to the spread of the disease in the community where the business is located, or the recent trips of such a person to the COVID-19 sites.
Such categories include employees who have been in contact with the public, for example, in schools, the high-density working environment and some major retailers.
In rare cases, workers from such a risk group may need to wear respirators.
If a person is sick in the plane, measures such as the isolation of a sick person from another person for a distance of 6 feet, the appointment of a member of a crew to care for a sick person, the provision of a mask to the sick person, or the request of such a person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin in a cough or sneeze, are needed to ensure the safety of workers and other passengers.
Secondary crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or when in contact with physiological liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protection if the patient has a fever, a regular cough or difficulty breathing.
Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag and the contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected. In the case of commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, safety measures include postponing travel in the event of illness, self-insulation and immediately informing the health centre on board when there is a heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical examination is to be carried out in an insulated room, and in the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term shutdown for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is in the school building, irrespective of the incidence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimal or average rate of infection in the community, social distance strategies can be put in place, such as the cancellation of exits for private meetings, gatherings and other mass events, such as exercise or chorus, taking food in cafeterias, increasing the distance between the parties, regulating the time of entry and care, limiting insignificant visits, and the use of a separate location of health-care facilities for children with flu symptoms.
At a high rate of spread in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, measures to stay out of school can be considered; for law enforcement officers who perform daily duties, the immediate risk to health is considered to be low in CDC ' s view.
Law enforcement officers who have an obligation to contact persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 contamination are encouraged to follow the same instructions as are prescribed for paramedics, including the use of appropriate personal protection.
In the event of close contact during the period of detention, workers must clean up and disinfect their uniforms and equipment prior to re-use by domestic cleaning aerosols or by means of decontamination, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and the disposal of used personal protections, as well as the use and washing of clothing.
OSHA is of the view that some categories of health and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel who contact patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection in the course of their aerosol-induced procedures or in the collection/processing of samples from persons with a confirmed diagnosis or an alleged COVID-19 infection.
The procedures followed by the formation of aerosols include sounding, coughing, bronchoscopying, some dental procedures, and examinations or invasive sampling.
Members of the morgues at high risk are those who treat the bodies of persons with a confirmed disease or a suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if they do an autopsie, they go to a very high risk category; additional engineering and safety means for such groups include the use of insulated spaces for patients with a confirmed disease or a suspect of COVID-19, including in procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosol.
In some health-care facilities and morgues, the use of special, negative-pressure vents can be an effective measure.
Samples should be treated in accordance with the precautions for biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the distribution of incoming patients to restricted waiting areas on the basis of suspected COVID-19 contamination. In addition to other means of personal protection, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers who work at a distance of up to 6 feet with confirmed or suspected SARS-COV-2 infections, as well as for those who conduct procedures with the formation of aerosol.
In the US, NIOSH-approved respirators for a person with a N95 or a higher class filter need to be used as part of a comprehensive written programme on respirator protection, which sets out the requirements for individual selection of funds and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and comfort to a staff member, and WHO does not recommend the use of special clothing, as COVID19 is a disease that is passed on in the respirator, not through physiological liquids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for staff performing screening at the patient reception point.
WHO recommends that persons who collect samples from the respiratory paths of patients with COVID-19 or the vectors of the disease, without procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosols, wear a surgical mask, sunglasses or face screen, robe and glove.
In the course of the procedures followed by the formation of the aerosol, the respirator N95 or FFP2 should be used instead of the surgical mask.
In view of the insufficient availability of personal protection facilities worldwide, WHO recommends that the need for such protection be minimized by the use of telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, access to a COVID-19-infected patient, only to those who provide direct care, the use of personal protections that are needed for a particular task, the continued use of the same respirator without removing it, while working with multiple patients with the same diagnosis, the monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection and the recommendation not to use masks for persons with no symptoms.

SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Relief and preparation for the future
DATE/DEVICE: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licences: CC0: No rights protected
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interconnection of people all over the world and our responsibilities to one another.
We have no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the ability to empathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We have seen a friendly and caring relationship between all of our colleagues, as reflected in e-mails, phones, and chats, a remarkable proof of the fact that, fortunately, we have been working with amazing people.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of the high quality of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to get to Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And that's possible thanks to your work, whether it's to make websites work, pay off our peers, or protect the safety of the community.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and this is even more important today than ever before.
At a time like this, not just what we do, but how we do it, is important to achieve meaningful results for the world.
In view of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the way in which we work together, starting with the coming week.
Adjusting the way we work and charts
As Robin said earlier, the c-team team met last night to discuss our approach and timetable for the coming days and months.
In the course of the dialogue, we considered our ideas on how best to deal with the current situation and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization in such a period.
The vast majority of us wanted to ease the strain and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back off, let it be like this.
For all staff, contractors and non-staff:
We expect it to take about four hours a day or 20 hours a week before the next order.
We don't announce weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, it's allowed for the purposes of our mission.
But the world is now unpredictable; whatever your need, whether to care for your family, to get food or to go to a doctor's office, your well-being is our number one priority.
We don't watch your time.
If you're sick, you don't have to work.
This is clear and undeniable, but we refer to it.
There is no need for a sick leave or a day off: just inform your manager and help the team to re-evaluate the calendar and schedule to cover key areas.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, inform Brian of T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and proper attention from the management to your situation.)
The full cost of hourly rates will be met.
We have already declared and reaffirmed our intention to meet the obligations of our contractors and staff with an hourly rate of payment.
Every person will be paid according to the normal hourly rates used in normal circumstances.
This means, in particular, periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll back you up.
A lot of people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.
What we're doing can have an amazing result, especially in times like this.
Again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to talk to your manager so we know what to expect, and we can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered to be essential.
We must always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (also) are doing critical work, which may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess the current objectives and to shift the focus to support, which is critical to our mission.
There are a lot of problems for each of us, and we're just focusing on the most important projects.
Slowing today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work “two more to catch up” after the end of the pandemic.
You will not need to work extra hours to meet the unreal time limit for the current period.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and timetables, if possible.
What's going on with APP (yearly plans)?
In order to meet the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the time frame for the implementation of our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of time for our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for the formulation of the budget, which will enable staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and the care of loved ones, with a shortened schedule for the next few weeks for all who need or want to work.
This extension has significantly reduced the current planning burden and tensions throughout the organization.
Next week, we will submit our proposal to the Council, inform representatives and teams of the relevant information on the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.
Thank the APP team for taking the lead in this work.
Office status, risks and cleaning
Last week, we found out that one of our co-workers in San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
But, in addition to a lot of precautions, we hired an anti-virus cleanup team to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used the anti-viral medical class to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the reception and elevator halls, through which we can access our floor.
The building implements its own rules of care, using products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in D.C. (DC) is on the Web, which has shared with us and all the staff in DC its COVID-19 rules.
Last week, our office in D.C. went to full-time work, in line with the instructions from San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the issue of renting a place in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues, working remotely, are aware of the possibility of correcting the situation and would like to give you some tips:
It is recommended to limit the meeting time to one or two hours.
If a longer session is needed, consider the possibility of splitting it into a course of a few days.
Define clearly the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and send out the material in advance.
By default, use video-links to facilitate interaction and communication, and use such tools as Google Docs and Zoom.
For ease of reference, appoint a focal point, the person who will follow up on the questions in the chat room and control the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for the notes (or the joint observation).
If necessary, contact the Technical Support Service via e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement when you buy appetizers.
Connect to the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your co-workers about the distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying the ergonomics manuals, which are available in Web-in order to promote the efficiency of the distributed work throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grantees to cancel the massive activities funded by Wikimedia, such as the "editathons" until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such waivers and other restrictions may result in the failure to implement agreed grant actions, and no one will be fined for the delay or change in such objectives.
We will be following up on Wikimania in the coming week, as well as on other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
The global sentiment in the global community is not just a sadness about the interruption of work, but also a sense of relief with the understanding and the ability to focus on our own communities, Wikimedia and more.
In terms of perspective, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page, which will provide space for the community to monitor exposure and communication.
We stay in touch on COVID-19-related issues.
We'll send an invitation to a special staff meeting in your calendar next Thursday, 2:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we will take the opportunity to share more up-to-date information, to answer your questions, and to spend time with each other.
We are together in this situation, and we are ready to help whatever we can.
You can still get information from such an e-mail, while other important information on COVID19 is from Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If there are questions about trips, events, key workflows, problems with reporting or other assistance, please contact the CRT.
We are ready to provide support and communication as needed.
If there are issues of confidentiality, contact Brian Joudan, director of HR International Global Operations, by e-mail.
No such change should be viewed as a renunciation of our work and commitments.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to enable us to continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the necessary service.
Our planned work will wait until the right time.
Now is the time to support one another and to create a space for the important work to be done in the weeks to come and possibly months to come.
To do so, we will need the help of each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, as well as to work as well as to the best of your ability as soon as the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Caterine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S) and the rest of the Team Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janen U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotenzine-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membrane) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 is countering the activity of angiotensin-transversive enzyme (ACE), reducing angiotensin-II content and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 is also a point of entry to the cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as haCE2.
Angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 is a zinc-consumptive metal ferment on the surface of endotile and other cells.
The ACE2 squirrel contains the N-end peptidetic dome of M2 and the C-end transport domain of the renal amino acid collector.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein type I, and it has an enzyme active dome to the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain ACE2 is sequestered from the trans-membrane dome with another enzyme, known as shaddas, and the soluble squirrel is released into the bloodstream and is eventually released with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most of the pulmonary pulmonary cells of type II, enterocytes of the thin intestines, arterial and venous endotal cells, and cells of the smooth muscles of the arteries of most organs.
The biosynthesis of the ACE2 IRNA is also found in the cortex of the brain, the stratum, the hypothalamus, and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE splits the hormonal angiotensin I into vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, recaptures the carboxylene endicure of henylhalanine from angiotenzine II (Asp-Arg-Val-tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it to the vaso-dioxidation angiotenzine (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also split a number of other peptids, including [des-Arg9] - bradikinin, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and greasing.
ACE2 also governs the membrane transport of neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-COV (SARS-COV); and SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, tying the S1 squirrel of the SARS-COV and SARS-COV2 to the enzyme of the ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and transposition of both the virus and the enzyme in the endosomes inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the pyming of a S serium prosthesis of a TMPRSS2 host, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic tool, which has led some to think that lowering ACE2 levels in cells can help in the fight against infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend that standard APF and BRA inhibitors be continued.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant 34 per cent reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group”.
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia has also been lowered in patients who have received APF inhibitors, who have been at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with a stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF ingibitors was also associated with a reduction in the mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less robust than for patients with a common risk of pneumonia.
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhaCE2) is supposed to be an innovation in therapies for acute lung injuries and is likely to improve pulmonary hemodinomics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory Syndrome caused by lipopolisharids.
The half-life rhaCE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the start of the operation is 30 minutes, in addition to the 24-hour exposure period.
Some data suggest that rhACE2 can be a promising tool for people with intransigence of classic renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases that increase circulating angiotensin II. Introduced rhACE2 has been assessed in clinical trials for acute respiratory distrusive Syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile phone software to assist in the epidemiology of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e., in the identification of persons (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions, a large number of applications have been developed or proposed, officially supported by the authorities.
A number of options have been developed to track contacts.
This has led to a discussion of the issues of confidentiality, especially with respect to systems that are based on the geographical location of the users of the application.
The softer options in this respect include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's intimacy with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join in integrating the Bluetooth support function directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, together with Alipai, has launched an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people living with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, and it is used in Singapore by an app called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code, and will be put under government control. North Macedonia has launched a "StopKorona" application, working on Bluetooth, to help track contact with potentially infected people, and to provide an operational link to health care.
The annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was expected to be logged in at Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking app was in the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks, and similar applications are to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering the use of applications based on the Singapore TraceTagether application and the BlueTrace protocol, and Russia is planning to use an application with a geosonic function to ensure that patients with COVID19 who live in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security, University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems that can arise from application-based systems, including misappropriation and potential inefficiencies if the application is used by a small part of the population.
In view of concerns about the proliferation of misguided or harmful “coronavirus” applications, Apple has restricted the list of types of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related applications to the App Store by including only “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
The privacy campaign has expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance of the population through coronavirus-related applications; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic, when the threat would disappear, would be dismantled.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limiting this type of oversight.
Organizations have declared eight conditions for public projects:
The monitoring should be “legitimate, necessary and proportional”;
The expansion of monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by time-limits;
The use of data should be limited to the purpose of controlling the proliferation of COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity must be protected and proof of such security must be provided;
Digital surveillance should prevent cases of increased discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be defined at the legislative level;
Protection from abuse, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse, should be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their list of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing a joint plan to address the problem of continuous monitoring, which is to remove the tracking device from their operating systems as soon as it is no longer necessary.
In some countries, online location tracking has been used instead of the application, making it impossible to download the application and to avoid tracing.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions, which have access to basic location data, also have major potential confidentiality problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of systems have been developed with confidentiality, which use central servers for communications only (see section below).
In South Korea, a system was used to track contact without using the application as a basis.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracing information from a variety of sources, including traceable mobile device and card transaction data, and then combined them to create a message in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected persons.
The Government not only used this information to warn citizens of potential contact with infected persons, but also made the information on the location available to the public, which was made possible by the major changes in the information protection legislation that had been made following the MERS outbreak in the country.
Such information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites; countries, including Germany, are considering the use of both centralized and confidential systems.
As at 6 April 2020, the details had not yet been made public.
Tracking contacts that maintain confidentiality is a well-established concept, with a large volume of research literature dating at least in 2013; as of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups have been working on confidentiality solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the user's approach to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT is a result of coordination efforts, which include both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized, confidential (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka CONTACT EventNumbers, CEN), confidentiality protocols, mobile contact tracking (PACT) mechanisms, etc.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that the identity that is identified never leaves the device and that all comparisons are made on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is developing SafePaths, a platform to ensure confidentiality in the collection and use of location or cross-track data to track COVID-19.
The work of the platform is based on the March 2020 study of Apps Gone Roger: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic, published in March 2020. A similar project is the SafeTrace platform, developed by Enigma MPC, a company that was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses robust hardware to enable users to share confidential data on location and health with other users and officials without risking the confidentiality of the data.
On 5 April 2020, a global coalition of TCNs was established by groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and ensuring global compatibility of the tracking and warning applications, which is a key factor in their wide distribution.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had discovered the BlueTrace source code used in its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, which they claimed would ensure confidentiality, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography, which would allow for confidentiality.
They also published the technical specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be rolled out in three stages:
Instruments to enable Governments to set up formal applications to track the movement of people infected with the coronavirus, but with the confidentiality of data
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google, and Apple, they plan to solve the problem of constant surveillance by first installing the system through the update of the operating system, and then removing it in the same way after the threat has disappeared.
Repositioning a drug (also known as reprofiling, redirecting, redirecting, or redirecting drugs) is a reprofiling of an approved drug to treat a disease or a medical condition other than the original one.
This is one of the areas of research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and reconvalescent plasma transfusion.
The analysis of these sequestration sites is an appropriate basis for the development of an effective anti-viral anti-protein drug COVID-19.
The most important target squirrels for SARS-COV-2 are popo-like proteasy, RNA-dependable RNA-polymerase, helica, S-protein, and ADF-ribophosphasis.
Hussain AA and the co-authors in their doclinical study examined a number of candidate congeners, which were then optimised, and analysed their similarity to the most similar approved drugs, in order to speed up the development of a highly effective anti-SARS-COV-2 drug, which will be recommended for clinical research.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug, which is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and associated hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs under the Solidarity clinical test.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that the test of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would start in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency application permit (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the FDA clinical test process and is only allowed under EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency care for patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under the clinical test scheme.
The CDC stated that “the use, dosing or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when there's no other way.
The Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine combined with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is being carried out at Duke University and Oxford University.
The University of New York School of Medicine in Langon is studying the safety and effectiveness of the prevention of hydroxychloroquine.
The Chinese clinical trials in Uhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravirus is “mutually effective. ”
For the 35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug, the negative result was on average four days later, while for the 45 patients who did not take the drug, the duration of the disease was 11 days.
In Uhan, a study was carried out to monitor 240 Pneumonia patients, one half of whom received favipiravirus and the other half a Umithenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Authority has reminded the public that the results of the drug's effectiveness are scarce and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy a drug in Japan to replenish its stock, and that it would use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe told Trump's administration about the possibility of buying a drug, and the drug can be less effective in neglected cases.
It may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients who try to get pregnant.
One study on the combination of anti-viral drugs “lopinavier” and“ritonawire” (Calette), concluded that “the effectiveness of the use of drugs has not been identified”.
The drugs have been designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by tying it to a protease.
A group of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a connection to the protesis of SARS-COV-2. In the scientific community, the reprofiling of drugs that have been specifically developed for the treatment of HIV and AIDS is critical.
WHO has included a combination of lopinavir and rhytonavir in the international “Solidarity” test.
The Remdesivere was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat the Ebola virus and the Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later found that the Remdesivere has anti-viral activity in vitro for a lot of filo, pneumo, paramix, and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with anti-virus treatment is the development of resistance through mutations, which can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early pre-studies show that the remdesire may have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and several clinical trials are currently under way, including two at the University Hospitals in Cleveland, one at moderately moderated patients, and the other at more severe patients.
There are currently three clinical trials for the infusion of vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a major form of COVID-19: two placebo-monitored studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).

Some antibiotics that have been found to be potentially suitable for use in COVID-19 treatment:
Tocylysumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has been clinically tested, many attempts to develop such a vaccine are still under way.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that the anti-SARS-COV-2 vaccine would be available in less than 18 months.
In April, five vaccines were screened for phase I security.
The COVID19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread all over the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-COV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI Initiative on Vaccine Development are to provide the required speed, production capacity, massive deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms for an effective vaccine against COVID-19 were in the process of being explored and developed in early 2020.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in the Phase I security study:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, RNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus vector type 5)
According to CEPI in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 other candidate vaccines have been reported, but there is little public information (presumed to be in the planning or development phase).
Phases I to II carry out pre-tests for safety and immunogeneity, usually re-ordered, placebo-monitored, and at several sites, while at the same time defining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III of the test usually includes more participants, including the control group; at this stage, the drugs are tested for the prevention of the disease, while at the same time the side effects are monitored at the best doses.
Of the 79 vaccines under active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on a human being (although doclinical research is still in progress).
On January 24, 2020, University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a vaccine with a molecular clamp, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate the immune response.

Other investment partners in the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Modena, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford, and Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020, that they were developing a self-implementing COVID-19 RNA-vaccine.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of the order from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of 275 million Canadian dollars to finance 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of multiple vaccines for vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
At about the same time, the Canadian government has announced an allocation of US$ 192 million specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as plans to develop a national “vaccine bank”, which will include a number of new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on a test of PittCoVac, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 on mice, saying that "MONA introduced SARS-COV-2 S1, causing strong responses to anti-gen-specialist antibodies [in mice], which occurred two weeks after the immunization.
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Canadian School of Pharmaceuticals announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine, which may be produced in the form of bulk spray.
With the use of bacteriophages, DNA will reproduce within human bacteria and form harmless viral-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies against the SARS-COV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities combined IBM supercomputers with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologic effects, also called non-special effects.
This means that they can have other benefits than the preventive properties.
Another case-by-case study in Australia covers 4,170 health-care workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may be unsafe or inefficient.
Early studies on the impact of animal-derived vaccines with COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenous mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, point to the need for measures to contain infection with biosafety 3 in the treatment of living viruses, as well as international coordination of standardised safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines available for the treatment of SARS that are safe and effective for humans.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world, and there is no verified vaccine against MERS.
When MERS began to spread, it was thought that the SARS study, which was being conducted at the time, could be the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-COV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (reliant on DNA) MERS vaccine, which was the first human clinical test, and three more, all of which were viral vector-based vaccines and were in the process of being developed, two were adenovirus (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA-vectoral (MVA-MERS-S).
Societal media spread the theory of conspiration, claiming that the COVID-19 virus was not new at all, and that a vaccine for it already existed.
The social media quotes some patients who claimed to have patents on the genetic sequencing of other strains of coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19) which is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute coronavirus Syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing, and respiratory problems.
Other symptoms may include a sense of fatigue, muscular pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between the first symptom and the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but it can also range from two to fourteen days.
Most of the cases are mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease is subject to viral pneumonia and polyorganic insufficiency.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases in 210 countries and regions had been reported, and more than 153,000 people had died from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have been cured, and the virus is mostly spread through close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops, released into the air by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although these drops are formed by exhalation, they are usually a threat by falling to the ground or on the surface, but do not pass through the air at long distances.
People also become infected with polluted surfaces, and then with their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is the most contagious in the first three days after the symptoms appear, although it can be spread both before the symptoms appear and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymeraceous real-time chain-reaction (RT-PRR) in a sample taken as a swab.
The use of medical masks is recommended to patients who are suspected of being sick, as well as to those who care for them.
The recommendations for the use of medical masks differ: some agencies recommend that they not be used at all, some recommend their use, and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
The local spread of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms or flu symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breath.
Extreme symptoms include difficulty in breathing, constant pain or a sense of stifling in the breast, confusion of mind, difficulty in awakening, facial or lip blindness; if the above-mentioned symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought without delay.
Symptoms of upper respiratory tracts, such as sneezing, sniffing, or throat pain, can be more common.
Also, there are gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, in different percentages.
Some of the cases reported in China have initially been characterized by a sense of stifling in the chest and a more frequent heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress in pneumonia, polyorganic insufficiency, leading to death.
It's called the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
In 97.5 per cent of the population, the symptoms begin to manifest within 11.5 days of the infection; according to available data, the symptoms are not common to all the infected.
The role of such unsympathetic carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary data suggest that they can contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of people infected with the virus is currently unknown and is only being studied, while the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that in 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus, the disease was not symptistic.
The National Health Commission of China began to include non-symptomatic cases in its daily report on 1 April; of the 166 cases reported on that day, 130 (78%) had been rejected without symptoms at the time of the test.
Both wet and saliva can have a greater concentration of the virus.
In a loud talk, there are more drops in the air than in a normal sound.
A study in Singapore found that the drops can be spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) with an open cough.
The virus is usually not airborne, but the National Academy of Science has suggested that the transfer of the virus by bioerosol is still possible, and the air test by air collectors in the halls outside the people ' s rooms has shown the presence of a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (CLR), can lead to the dispersion of exhalation products and, therefore, to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus can be spread through fecals, but this risk is considered to be low; the virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible before the symptoms occur, but the risk is small.
The European Center for the Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) states that it is not yet clear how easily the virus is spread, yet it is known that one patient usually infects two to three others, and the virus can survive on the surface from hours to days.
In particular, it was found that on the cardboard surface the virus can live for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99% of the copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These figures, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and washing agents, when used correctly, have a very useful effect in controlling the contamination: soap destroys the fat layer of the virus, deactivates it, and can also remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and gluconate (surgical disinfectant) are less effective against the virus. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the hospitalization.
For five out of six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and for the sixth patient, the highest level of the virus in the blood was found on the second day of the test.
The severe acute coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new acute coronavirus Syndrome that was first found in three people with pneumonia from a group of acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-COV-2 virus are also found in natural coronaviruses.
While outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by soap, which opens up its protective casing.
The lungs are the organ most exposed to COVID-19, as the virus penetrates host cells through angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II alveolar lung cells.
The virus is connected to the ACE2 and penetrates the host cell by means of a characteristic surface glycoprotein, a "spike" (peplomer).
12 per cent of the infected people in Uhan Hospital have been diagnosed with severe myocardial damage, which is more common in the event of a severe form of disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the system-wide inflammation response and the disorders of the immune system observed during the progression of the disease, but the acute damage to myocardium may also be due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large numbers, as they participate in the work of this body.
The high rate of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in patients in the ISA with COVID-19, and may indicate bad predictions. The autopsis of patients who died of COVID19 revealed the presence of diffuse alveolary injuries (DAD) and lymphocytous inflammable infyltrates in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropic effect on ACE2-expressing epithelic airway cells, patients with heavy COVID-19 have symptoms of system hyperinflammation.
In particular, it has been found that GM-XF pathogens of T-cells correlate with the recruitment of inflammable monocytes emitting IL-6 and heavy lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Limphocytar infiltrations were also found at the time of the autopsy.
WHO has also published several test protocols for this disease.
The real-time polymeric chain reaction (RT-CPR) is a standard test method.
The test is usually carried out on respirator samples from a swab, but may also be carried out with a swab from a nose or wet swab.
The results are usually available for a period of between a few hours and two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken in two weeks, and the results are not of direct value.
Chinese scientists have been able to separate the strain of the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequencing so that scientists in labs around the world can self-develop polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of the virus.
As at 4 April 2020, anti-body tests, which could have been found to be infested at the present time, as well as possible past infections, were under development but are not yet widely available.
The Chinese experience with the test results has shown that it is only 60 to 70 per cent accurate.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Department of Food and Drug Quality Control (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test to be used at the end of this month.
The two-sided multi-pronged sub-propellancy tricks of the type of "matter-glass" with peripheral, asymmetrical and a posterior distribution are common symptoms that are detected at an early stage of the disease.
Sub-plural domination, the symptom of a rocky bridge (extensive chunking of a variable alveolar) and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
There is little data on microscopic and pathophysics of COVID-19.
Main results of the pathology study carried out during the post-mortem:
Macroscopy: pleurite, pericarditis, sealing and lung swelling
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Light form of pneumonia: lung swelling, hyperplasia of pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyteric infiltration, and multi-nuclear giant cell formation
Heavy pneumonia: Difficult alveolar (DAD) with diffuse alveolar excude.
DAD is the cause of acute respirator distress Syndrome (RDS) and severe hypoxemy.
Healing pneumonia: organization of exsudes in alveolary fields and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: Difficult intra-circulatory clotting (DVC Syndrome); Leukerorrhoblastic response
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of contagion include stay at home, the avoidance of public spaces, the frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, the observance of air hygiene, and the avoidance of touches on the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inside of the ulna.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended that a quality hand-hygienic procedure be carried out.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of facial masks in public spaces, inter alia, to limit the transmission of infections by persons with an unsymptomed flow of the disease; social dispersion strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have closed schools and enterprises, restricted the movement of citizens and eliminated major public events.
Distance recommendations also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no drugs with confirmed effectiveness against COVID-19. Since the development of the vaccine is not expected to be completed before 2021, the bulk of the measures against the proliferation of COVID19 are to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as the “to-the-plateau” epidemic.
CDC also recommends that hands with soap and water should be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after a toilet visit or when the hands are heavily polluted, as well as before food and after shrivelling, coughing or sneezing.
CDC also recommends the use of a disinfectant (alcohol content at least 60 per cent) for hand-hand handling, but only when soap and water are not available, where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two prescriptions for local production.
Ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity are used in these formulations.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to address a bacterial dispute in alcohol and is not an appropriate tool for antiseptic hand processing.
Glycerol is added as a humidifier.
Patients are shown support therapy, which can include infuse therapy, Oxygen support, as well as support to other affected vital organs.
CDC recommends that those who suspect to be infected with the virus wear a common medical mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxygen (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Respect for personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles and diet are recommended to strengthen immunity.
Supportive therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptoms at an early stage of the disease, and WHO and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for the care of patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care doctors and pulmonologists summed up the therapeutic advice of the various institutions in a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
To treat the symptoms as first-line drugs, some health-care providers recommend a choice for paracetamol (acetaminophen) in relation to ibuprofen.
Precautionary measures should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health-care facilities, when carrying out procedures that may result in air-capable release, such as intubation or hand-drying.
The CDC recommends that health-care workers who care for people with COVID-19 should be placed in an air-capable unit (AIIR), an additional measure, in addition to the standard precautionary measures in terms of contact and air. The CDC has issued recommendations on the use of personal protection devices (PISs) during a pandemic.
Recommended personal protective equipment: a protective robe, a respirator or a medical mask, an eye protection device and a medical glove; it is preferable to use a respirator rather than a medical mask.
The N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with an emergency application permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but, when used not according to an instruction, the effectiveness in protecting against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends the use of protective face screens or, at the very least, the making of masks on their own in the home.
In most cases, the form of the current COVID-19 is not heavy enough to require artificial lung ventilation or an alternative to it, but there is also a percentage of cases where it is necessary.
The type of respirator support for hospitalized infirmary patients associated with COVID-19 is currently under active study, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided by means of an Oxygen node with an intensive air flow or a two-tier positive pressure in the airway.
It is not yet known whether any of these two ways is as effective for patients in critical condition as SVL.
Some doctors opt for invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, if available, as this method significantly restricts the spread of particles in the air relative to an intensive air-flow nose canal, and the risk of a severe form of disease for the elderly (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
In many developed countries, there is a shortage of hospital beds per capita, and the resources of health-care systems are too limited to cope with the dramatic increase in the incidence of COVID-19 in a critical form that requires hospitalization.
According to a study in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive care, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for their lungs, and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30 per cent of the people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The task of air-ventilating the lungs is more complex, as the acute respiratory distress Syndrome (ARDS) is developing with COVID-19, and oxygen is causing more and more problems.
The AVL, supported by inhalation pressure and PVCs, is necessary to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure a minimum of damage to them by ventilating, which can result in a pneumothorax.
In earlier fan models, a high PVC may not be available.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and a number of anti-viral drugs are currently in the process of being clinically tested.
Remdesire is the most promising.
The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the last stages of the test.
Anti-viral drugs can be tested for patients with severe diseases.
The WHO-advised volunteers are involved in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has granted temporary permission to use reconvalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where life is in serious or immediate danger.
It has not been subject to clinical research to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to combat the outbreak.
Users must enter their name and identity number to log in.
The application can detect a "near contact" with the observation data and, as a result, the potential risk of contamination.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is found, the application not only recommends self-insulation, but also sends a message to the local health authorities, analytics of big data from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence, such means are used to track infected people and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to track data from mobile phones of people who are allegedly infected with the coronavirus.
Quarantine and protection measures have been put in place for persons who may be in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, the Federal Government of Germany and the Robert Koch Institute provided aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognising technology has been put in place to detect infractions.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said that cellular network operators report that “40% of people are still moving through the Territory.
The Government of Germany conducted a 48-hour holiday programming marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersty Kalulaid, also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People can experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor: “Enhanced social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming the mental health and well-being of people.
The disease can take place in a light form with little or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Patients with a mild form of illness tend to recover within two weeks, while the treatment of patients with severe or critical forms may take from three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of obtaining a severe form of COVID-19 based on data on other such viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although there are no such data for COVID19; some people may be hit by COVID19 and cause pneumonia as a complication.
In the case of persons with the most severe current of the disease, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to the acute respiratory distress Syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or polyorganic failure.
Complexity of COVID-19 includes sepsis, abnormal thorax, and heart, kidney, and liver problems.
Anomalies of thorax, especially the increase in protrombin time, have been described in 6 per cent of the patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, while 4 per cent of the group has a kidney failure.
About 20–30% of patients with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were in hospital.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to an earlier study, the average time between the initial symptoms and the day of death was 14 days, with a full range of 6 to 41 days.
According to a study carried out by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8 per cent and for women 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological studies of post-mortem lungs show a diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromyxoids in both lungs.
There have been viral cytopathic changes in the pneumocytes.
The look of the lung was like an acute respirator distress Syndrome.
In 11.8 per cent of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems have been to increase the level of troponin or to stop the heart.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and the availability of health-care resources and the socio-economic situation in the region can also have an impact on mortality.
Death estimates vary according to state due to such regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Inadequate estimates of cases in light form can result in an overestimation of the mortality rate.
However, the fact that death is a result of past diseases can mean that the current rate of death is undervalued.
In the case of smokers, the severe symptoms of COVID-19 have developed a total of 1.4 times more, with about 2.4 times more people in need of intensive care or dying than non-smokers, and concerns have been expressed about the long-term effects of the disease.
The Hong Kong office found that some of the patients who have recovered from the disease had a drop of between 20 and 30 per cent in their lungs, and their scanning revealed damage.
After recovery, it can also lead to after-intensive care.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients who had been cured had permanent immunity against the virus.
According to the current of other coronaviruses, this is believed to be possible, but there have also been reported cases in which, after recovery from COVID-19, the coronavirus test was still positive.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been an exacerbation of the prolonged period of the disease, not a re-infection.
The virus is considered to be a natural, animal and infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the virus was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, refers to 1 December 2019 as the earliest date of the first case.
According to official data published by WHO, the date was 8 December 2019.
There are usually a number of methods used to measure mortality.
All the figures vary according to the region and the time of the spread of the disease, and are also affected by the levels of testing, the quality of health-care systems, the treatments used, the time of the outbreak and the parameters of the population, such as age, gender and the general state of health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency code for ICD-10: U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-COV-2. The ratio of deaths to infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9 per cent (153,822/2,240,191).
This figure varies from region to region, and some other methods include the determination of the disease-related mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died as a result of the disease, as well as the measurement of the transient mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and non-diagnosed) who have died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of a certain segment of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced by all patients who have been infected, the presence of such antibodies makes it possible to see how many people have been infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castillon d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease was spread during the celebration of carnival to young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overburdened.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population can have antibodies, based on blood supply.
COVID19 is an official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality levels differ between men and women.
According to studies in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher for men.
The group with the highest risk is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women has been narrowing only since the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this discrepancy are unknown, but may lie in genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower incidence of female smoking, associated with male diseases (e.g. hypertension in men at a younger age than in women) can cause higher male mortality.
In Europe, 57 per cent of those infected were men, and 72 per cent of deaths from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government has not maintained gender statistics for COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and ORVI have different gender statistics.
Most health-care workers, especially health-care personnel, are women, so they have a better chance of becoming infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
The head of WHO, Mr. Tetros Adanom Gebreus, explains: "CO" means "coron", "VI" means "virus", "D" means "disease" and "19" is the year the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
This name has been selected to avoid reference to a particular geographic location (e.g. China), species or groups of humans, as required by international recommendations for naming to prevent stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Coronary Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO uses the terms “COVID-19” and “COVID-19” in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus themselves are commonly called the Coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Ouhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly called the "Kronovirus" and the "Hochana Coronavirus".
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical spaces in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms “stroke respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names for the virus and the disease.
On February 11, 2020, the official names "COVID-19" and "SARS-COV-2" were published.
Due to the limitations on the volume of standard supply chains, some digital service providers print medical material, such as nose swabs, as well as details of SVL machines.
In one such case, the Italian clinic was in urgent need of a ventilation valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it in the required time, and one of the local industries was reprofiled and was able to print the required 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, various theories of conspiration, misinformation and fait accompli about the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the virus began to spread at a high rate on the Internet.
It's possible that humans can infect other animals with the virus.
Research has not confirmed the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks, and chickens.
So far, there is no approved vaccine for the virus or for drugs to treat it.
Various international research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 are currently being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial (SOLIDARITY test) programme, the aim of which is to assess the treatment effect of the four existing compounds, which are considered to be the most effective to date.
There is no completed vaccine yet, but various organizations are active in the development of vaccine-candidates.
Both SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 penetrate human cells with the ACE2 receptor, so the results of previous research on SARS-COV are used in research.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are trying to develop a complete virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead form, is intended to cause a quick human immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a sub-equivalent vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that makes the immune system more sensitive to certain sub-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-COV-2, such research is directed at the destruction of a spike-like squirrel that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA or RNA-vaccines, a new method for the creation of a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed for either of these strategies are to be tested for safety and effectiveness. The first clinical test of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle on March 16, 2020.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code, copied from a virus that causes the disease, and the anti-tellosis increase has been identified as a potential problem in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this is a controversial assumption.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials have been carried out.
The drugs approved for the treatment of malaria were evaluated in seven tests, four of them for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The reprofiling of anti-viral drugs is a major part of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine phase III studies on remdesivir had been carried out in a number of countries.
As of April 2020, the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for COVID-19 was reviewed in a dynamic manner. For the same purpose, a number of other anti-viral drugs for COVID-19 are also under consideration, including remdesivere, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinauir/ritonawire, as well as lopinavir/ritonavirus, combined with beta interferon.
As of March 2020, preliminary data are available on the effectiveness of the use of rhamdesive.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients who have received the Ramdesire as an exception.
Stage III of the clinical trials is already under way in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine previously used for the treatment of malaria was reviewed in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.
There is, however, a need for expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dosage of one gram, but notes that a doubling of this dosage is very dangerous and can result in fatality.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued a permit for the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians who treat patients with COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high levels of fishavian are needed to inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for a detailed study in vivo by demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations.
Research on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin has serious limitations that prevent the health community from using these treatments without more detailed study; Ozeltamivir does not inhibit SARS-Cov-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is not clear.
Hypercytokinemy may occur as a complication at late stages of the heavy form COVID-19.
There is evidence of the fact that hydroxychloroquine may have properties of hypercytokinemy, and a small study by the National Health Commission of China has included tozilysyrumab in the recommendation for the treatment of coronavirus.
The drug has been in the 2nd phase of a non-randomised test, which is being carried out at the national level in Italy, after the positive results have been obtained from patients with a severe condition.
In combination with a blood serum test on ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counter factors that are thought to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved antagonist for interlequine 6 on the basis of retrospective case studies to treat the release of steroid refractory cytokine due to another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there is no rendomized and controlled evidence that tozilysumab is an effective means of treating the Cytokin release syndrome.
The transfer of cleaned and concentrated antibodies from COVID-19 immune systems to people in need is now seen as a non-vaccin passive immunization method.
The strategy has been tested in the treatment of patients from SARS, but the results have been unconvincing.
Neutralizing the virus is the expected effect that passive antibodies therapy can provide protection against SARS-COV-2.
Other mechanisms, such as anti-body-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or fagocytosis, may, however, be used.
Other forms of passive antibodies therapies, such as monoclonial antibodies, are in the process of being developed.
The use of reconvalescent blood serum, which consists of a liquid part of the blood of healed patients and contains antibodies against the virus, can be increased.
