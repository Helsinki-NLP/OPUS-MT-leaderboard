Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned about “associating with the muppets”
Some CAs are horrified by the recommendation to change the name of their office to “member of Parliament Wales” (MWP).
This recommendation was made by plans to change the name of the Assembly to "Parliament of Wales."
The whole political spectrum is concerned that it can make fun of you.
One of the LABs claimed that his group was worried about the Roms with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "unthinkable", and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
The Welsh Party has said that his group is "not content" and is offering alternatives.
One of the Welsh Conservatives said that his group was “inconclusive” about changing the name, but noted that MWP could quickly become a “mappet”.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is like the Yorkshire English term "u".
The Assembly ' s Commission, which is currently developing a law to change names, observed: "The rest of the decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be taken by the members themselves. "
The Welsh Self-Settlement Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of the public debate on the proposals, and the renaming of the Assembly to the Welssa Parliament received wide support.
As far as the name of the CA is concerned, the commission is proposing to call them "the members of the Wels Parliament," or WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest support from the public.
Of course, the CHA is offering alternatives, but trying to reach an agreement can cause problems to head Elien Jones, who has to submit a bill to change for a few weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules of exclusion of the FA and the structure of the committee system.
WHEN the law is discussed, the final vote will be held on its new name.
The Macedonians go to a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the polls are voting on whether to change the name of the country to the North Macedonian Republic.
Voting was organized to resolve a long-term dispute with a neighboring country in Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athene has long argued that the name of their northern neighbor is a claim in the territory of Greece, and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
President George Ivan of Macedonia, who opposes a referendum to change the name, said he would ignore the result of the vote.
But the supporters of the referendum, including the prime minister of Zoran Zayev, say that a change in name is just a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Call St. Martin silent, for the Harlem Church is going through a difficult time.
“The old people I've been talking to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Mr. Adams says.
Now there's neither."
He thinks that it's possible to understand the break-up of bars:
“In modern times, people are being socialized in a different way.
The bars are no longer the local lounge to which they go regularly.
As far as the churches are concerned, Adams is afraid that the money from the sale of assets will not be as long as the leaders expect, and “they will be where they began sooner or later. ”
Churches, he added, can replace condominium houses, and there will be people who will not help the shrines that are in the vicinity.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white, ” Adams explained, “so it will speed up the day when all of these churches will close, for it is unlikely that most of those who move to the condominiums will become their parishioners. ”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin was built ten years later.
The root white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The black community that performed the rites in the vicinity was entitled to the property of the building.
St. Martin went to the black community under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of the splintered merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, and they didn't want to take blacks to work and raise them in the service.
In 1939, the fire severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson’s parishioners wanted to reinstate it and set up a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor to Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called the Carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the Carillon in July called it another one: a “cultural treasure” and a “familiar historical instrument.
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first carillon to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to a bigger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merrivester, he was not replaced in St. Martin.
What has been happening in St. Martin in the last few months is a complex history of architects and subsidiaries, some of whom have been involved by church leaders, others by the bishop diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, which is made up of worldly leaders, wrote in July to the diocese, which is concerned that the diocese “will try to pass on the expenses” with the council not taking part in the recruitment of the architects and subsidiaries sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark was traumatized by a 13-year-old boy who ran behind lobsters in California.
According to the official, on Saturday, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him, and a boy ran behind lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place at almost 7:00 a.m. at Bicon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that it was about a half an hour in the morning with friends when he heard the boy cry for help, and with a group, he went to see him to get out of the water.
Hummel at first thought it was just a catch of lobster, but then he realized the boy was yelling, "I've been bitten!
I've been tasted."
As soon as he got to the boy, he saw that his clavicle was completely broken.
"I was yelling at everyone to come out of the water, "in the water of a shark!" Hummel added.
The boy was taken to the Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in a critical state.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
The rescue captain, Larry Giles, on the Brigging for the MI, told us that a few weeks ago a shark was spotted in this area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the victim was traumatized at the top of the body.
For the purposes of investigation and security, the authorities for 48 hours shut down access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablade to Swami in Encinitas.
Giles noted that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sunsbury's planning to go to the British market for cosmetics
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Bots, Superdrug, and Debenhams by means of cosmetics-like islands that are in the top.
As part of a strong entry to the British market for cosmetics at a cost of £2.8 billion (continuing to grow at a time when the volume of sale of clothing and household goods is falling) the increased island with cosmetics will be tested in 11 shops all over the country, and next year, if the idea is successful, the island will be found in other shops.
Invest in cosmetics is about how supermarkets are looking for ways to use the space used on TV, microwave furnaces, and household goods.
In the Sunsbury's, they say they're double the assortment of cosmetics and they're offering up to 3,000 brands for the first time, such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw.
The current L'Oreal, Mybelline, and Burt's Bees as well will have more space: there will be branded areas like those in shops like Bots.
The supermarket is also updating the Boutique assortment: now most of the products presented will not be tested on animals, which are increasingly required by young buyers.
In addition, a detached parfum salesman, France Shop, protestes his trays in two Sunsbury's shops: the first tray opened in Kroydon, North London, last week, and the second one opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Web-shoping and moving to the shopping of small amounts of food every day in small shops makes supermarkets make extra effort to get visitors.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of the Sunsbury's, stated that their shops would become more like a mall, as the supermarket network was trying to resist Aldi and Lidl Discounters with more services and non-food items.
Sunsbury's are opening up Argos Divisions in hundreds of their shops, as well as a number of Habitats Departments open.Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago, and say that this has increased sales of food products, and made both networks more lucrative.
The last attempt by the supermarket to update the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals has failed.
The sainsbury's was tested with Bots in the early 2000s, but it ended after an argument about how to separate the profits from the supermarkets.
The new strategy came after the Sunsbury's sold their pharmacy business (281 pharmacies) to Célesio, owner of the Loyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds of sterling three years ago.
They agreed that the Lloyds would help by adding an extended ascent of the leather brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vicky, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hix, the business director of the Sunsbury, said, "We have changed the appearance of our cosmetics islands to make the atmosphere more pleasing to the customers.
We also invested in specially trained counselors who would be able to give advice.
The brands that we have presented are called upon to meet any needs, and the pleasant environment and the comfortable location means that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is the competition of the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is "disabled" because Holly Willoughby has entered into a deal worth 11 million pounds sterling.
The star Peter Jones "Dreacon Lie" is "splintered" because Holly Willoughby's TV newscaster is out of a deal with his brand of goods for life (the deal is 11 million quid sterling) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of housewear and Truly axes.
The couple's business was related to Goop Gwyneth Peltrow's brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced her entry to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby led Peter Jones's star "Dream Fist" to the story when at the last moment she left their lucrative business of goods for life to focus on new win-win contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones is "splintered" when a TV girl confessed to her gold during a busy Tuesday meeting at the Jones Business Empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements costing £1.5 million of sterling mean she no longer has enough time to dedicate it to their common brand of housewear and Truly axes.
This business was related to the Goop Gwyneth Peltrow brand, and it had to double the value of Willoughby, which is estimated to be £11 million sterling.
When 37-year-old Willoughby told Instagram that she was from Truly, Jones left Britain for one of her rest homes.
The source said, "Truly was no doubt Holly's main priority.
He was to be her long-term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to leave the business was stunning to all interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost before the launch.
At Marlowe's headquarters, it's a full set of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that the entry of the head of This Morning, one of the highest-paying stars in Britain, could cost firms millions of dollars in large-scale investment in goods (out of pillows and candles to clothing and housewear) and create further start-up delays.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The three children of Willowby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of government in March.
The couple spent the festivals together, and Jones owns 40 percent of the stock of a company in Baldwin, which is a TV company.
Willoughby will become an M&S brand agent and replace Antony McPartlin as I'm a Celebrity host to ITV.
The source near Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism that the news media will get for a comment that someone would think is “non-presidential,” as well as for the very positive attitude towards North Korea’s leader.
"Why did President Trump do such big things?"
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news. —
I didn't go to any action."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks are in a dead end.
More than three months after the June alone in Singapore, the leading North Korean diplomat, Ri Young Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea was not seeing a “suitable response” from the United States to its first disarmament steps.
Instead, he remarked, the United States is continuing to enforce pressure.
Trump was much more optimist when he spoke at his meeting.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea," he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have such a wonderful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of the hostages, and the return of the rest of the United States military forces to their homes.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be a president, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this stacked stadium, we've got about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of it.
The tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, in the wake of the Lomboca earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lomboca was affected, the national disaster has not been declared, and this is a change to international aid.
“In many cases, sadly, they made it clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so it's a bit tricky, ” said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is gathering a team to go to Pale, it is not yet known if the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the national disaster management agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palau to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
In view of the constant occurrence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains horrendously unprepared for the anger of nature.
Aceh has been built to keep from the tsunami, but it is not characteristic of the other coastlines.
The apparent absence of alarms about the tsunamis in Pale, even though the warning was active, was likely to have contributed to death.
Traveling between the countless Indonesian islands is more than just in the best of times.
Natural calamities make the logic even more complex.
The medical ship that was in Lomboca to treat the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Pale, but at least three days from now it will be possible to get to the site of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo has made the infrastructure of Indonesia the basis of his campaign and has increased the cost of roads and railroads.
But the funding deficit has created problems for Mr. Joko's administration, who is planning to change next year.
Mr. Joko has also been hindering inter-confessional rivalry in parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, tens of thousands of people hung out of their homes as a result of the resistance of Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look: Daniel Starridge from Liverpool scores a goal from the depth of the field and compares the account to Chelsea.
Daniel Starridge rescued the Liverpool from the defeat of the Chelsea in Premire's for an 89th minute naked Saturday at the London Stadium Stadium, Stamford Bridge.

He rolled the ball on his left leg and loaded it in the direction of a long-distance pony.
The ball flew high above the fine in the direction of the top right corner of the port.
He overflyed the jumping Capa Arrissabalago and fell to the gate.
“It was just an attempt to take up the position to keep the time, and players like Shachiri are always going to attack as much as possible, so I was just trying to get as much time as possible,” said Starridge LiverpoolC.com.
I saw Kante coming, and I made one touch, I didn't think about it too much, and I just took the ball.
"Chelsey" led with an account of 1-0 after the first time that the Belgian star, Eden Azar, scored a goal for 25 minutes.
The attacker of the blues passed back to Mateo Kovacic, rolled around the middle of the field, and ran fast half the Liverpool.
Kovacich quickly played a wall in the middle of the field.
Then he made a fine penetrating pass, which led Azar to a fine.
The ball passed over Aliceson Becker's Liverpool gateway.
Liverpool is playing against "Napole" in the group phase of the League of Champions at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
"Chelsey" is playing with Videoton in the UEFA League of Europe at 3:00 a.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami-related deaths in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of people killed by the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, and the Indonesian agency for the management of the consequences of the catastrophes on Sunday morning.
A lot of people left behind in the holes of a building that was destroyed by a seven-and-a-half-point five-day earthquake, which caused a 6-metre-high wave, reported to the press secretary of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Pale, home to more than 380,000 people, has been swept by ruins of destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man for suspicion of murder after a woman was slaughtered to death.
An investigation into the murder began after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Mercisside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with a stab wound in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was reportedly arrested in the murder.
The police called for a response from people who had seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented, "The investigation is in the early stages, but I'm asking everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious, to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially the cabbies, who could have shot something on the video recorder, to contact us, because the information on this video can be very important to our investigation.
A member of the police confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the house.
Today, in the afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to the scene of the crime to ask where they found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said that they are now informing the victim’s closest family.
The cab driver, who lives in Grayson-Muse, just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police said no one was allowed to go in and out of the house.
When he found out what had happened, he lost the gift of language.
The people are now told that it will be an hour before they are allowed to go home.
Some have heard a policeman tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene of the crime, a woman in tears appeared.
She says, "It's so terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were outside the fence, and another van was in front of the fence.
A number of policemen were standing behind the fence and watching the apartment building.
All who have information are requested to write a direct message to @MerPolkCC, call number 101 or anonymously call the Crimestoppers line to number 0800 555 111, and name the code 247 and the date of September 30.
The Cromwell Statue near Parliament is a new monument that suffers from the "census of history"
The removal of the statue would be a well-deserved payment for the destruction in the Taliban style of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, carried out by his fanatical puritarian followers.
But Cromwell's co-operation called Mr. Creek's offer a "dreamy" and a "tempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, the head of Cromwell's Division, said: "Bearing in mind the current debate about the removal of the statues, that the image of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace was an imminent target."
Iconisting in English civil wars was not done either by Cromwell himself or by his command.
Cromwell is likely to be undeservedly sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, in the previous century.
The grand picture of Cromwell, the sculptor William Hamo Thornecroft, is a 19th-century message and part of the history of the art, which many think is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, probably more in the late 19th century than now, think Cromwell is a defender of Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, a monarchy.
Whether such an idea is entirely accurate is the subject of the historical debate that is going on.
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has defined the future of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the well-known items that represents one side of the conflict.
His accomplishments as a Lord-Protector are also worth celebrating and revering.
The killer pig destroyed a Chinese farmer to die.
According to local MFIs, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by the name of Yuan, was found dead in blood with a broken artery near a pig shop in Liupanchoi, Guizhou, reported to South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In Sinin, Qinghai, China, on May 30, 2005, the pig is about to immunize the pigs in the pig shop.
It is reported that on Wednesday, he left with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and found the pork door open.
The brother pointed out that there was a big boar in the pig shop with blood on his mouth.
The forensic experts confirmed that the 249-kilogram boar destroyed the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloodthirsty and twisted," said a bi-born brother with the name Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The security cam records show that Yuan was on the market at 4:40 a.m., Thursday morning, to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The creature that killed the man was not Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the news that when the police gathered the evidence at the scene, the pig was shut down to prevent her from attacking people.
It's reported that the seven I'm Yuan and the market administration are talking about compensation for his death.
Although it is rare, there have been cases of assault by pigs on people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused critical injuries to a man.
Ten years earlier, a 295 - kg - weighted pig held a Welsh farmer clinging to a tractor until the farmer’s wife terrorized the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer stated CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but blood taste can become a triger.
"They're just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they don't want to harm you.
You just have to treat them with due respect," he said.
The excess of Hurricane Rose will bring massive rains to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is drifting over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the nearest days, Rose will bring the rains with the floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rose had winds at a rate of 137 km per hour (this is a hurricane of category 1) on Sunday morning, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to go to the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Pacific is beginning to form a hull that is moving east to the west coast of the United States, and when Rose hits the low-Californian peninsula on Monday, it will start to push a strong tropic humidity to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will bring up to 25,4 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next, on the nearest day, the tropic dampening that is intertwined with the contiguity that is nearing will create strong rains in the southwest.
In this area, between 2,54 and 10,2 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, garbage streams, and the possibility of displacement in the desert.
Severe tropic dampening will result in an increase in the number of falls in places to 5–7.6 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain from 5 to 10,2 cm in some parts of the southwest, especially in a significant area of Arizona.
Rainfalls are possible when conditions worsen due to the diverse nature of tropical rains.
We are always advised not to go to the desert on foot, for there may be tropical rains.
Heavy rain can make canyons a turbulent river, and storms can bring winds and sandstorms.
The nearness of the hull will cause heavy rains in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The number of fallouts can be over 1.27 cm, which can cause meagre waste streams and slippery roads.
It's gonna be the first rain in the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and in the morning on Monday, and in the evening on Monday and Tuesday, the rain will become more extensive.
It's gonna rain a lot on For Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperature changes throughout the United States, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics are still quite warm.
At times, this has led to a sharp change in temperature at short distances.
On Sunday, we'll see a wonderful example of the steep temperature changes in the central US.
This is a 7-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and DeMoines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer will try to return and spread again.
It is expected that in a significant area in the center and east of the United States it will be warm by October, and the temperature from the south to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 12 degrees Celsius above the mean temperature.
According to our long-term forecast of the weather, there is a high probability of an over-temperature in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have been watching the Brett Cavanaugh hearing.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people in six TV networks watched the fascinating testimony of a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Cavanaugh, and Christin Blazey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, which was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s.
The political opposition continued, and the channels interrupted the planned programs to report the last news on Friday: a deal prepared by Senator Arizona, Jeff Flake, that the FBI was conducting a one-week inquest on the charge.
Ford told the Court Committee of the Senate that she was 100% sure Cavanaugh was wearing it and was trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Cavanaugh, in his emotional testimony, said that he was 100% sure it didn't.
It's possible that more than 20.4 million people were watching this on Friday, as reported by the Nielsen research company.
The company counted the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Unable to get the numbers on other networks, which also showed the listeners, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen tends to have problems measuring the number of people watching TV in office.
By comparison, such an audience is the size of an audience that watches a play-off game or an Oscar award.
Fox News Channel, whose fans were very supportive of Cavanaugh's appointment, was the leader of all the channels, which lasted all day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, at Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS has 3.1 million viewers, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million, and CNN has 2.52 million.
The interview remained high after the hearing.
Flake has become the center of the Friday drama.
The office of this moderate Republican published a statement that he was going to vote for Cavanaugh, and then on Friday morning, CNN and CBS were caught yelling at Flake when he was trying to take the elevator to the Court's Committee.
He was standing with his eyes down for a few minutes, and he was barked in direct air on CNN.
"I stand right in front of you," said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
It was said to him, "You have power, but a host of women are powerless."
Blake reported that his office had published a statement and, before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more at the committee's hearing.
All the cable and wide-area channels were broadcasting live hours later, when the Courts Committee was to vote to advance Cavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate in full.
Flake said he'd only do it if he knew the FBI would look at the charges against the candidate next week, which requires a democratic minority.
Flake was partly persuaded to talk to his friend, Senator-Democrat Chris Coons.
After talking to Kuns, and then with a few more Senators, Flake made a decision.
Fluke's choice had an effect, as it was clear that the Republicans would have no votes to appoint Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa Mae is blaming critics for "policy games" around Brexit.
In an interview with Sunday Times, the Prime Minister, Teresa May, accused the critics of her exit plans from the European Union of playing "policy" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, the British prime minister, Teresa May, arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview that took place next to Theresa's interview on the front page of the paper, the former minister of foreign affairs to her government, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Checkers plan for Brexit, saying that it was “absolutely absurd to suggest to Britain and the EU to draw the toll on one another. ”
Who shot Wade Simms: the police arrested Dayton Simpson for suspicion of the death of a player at the University of Louisiana
The police arrested a suspected gunman who led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the University of Louisiana.
The 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison for second-level murder, reported to the Baton-Roch Police Department.
The authorities published a video argument between Sims and Simson, and the police said that Sims lost his eyeballs in a fight.
According to an affidavit by CBS, the WAFB TV station, the police removed the eyeballs from the scene of the crime and indicated that they found Simpson's DNA on them.
After interviewing Simpson, the police reported that he had confessed that he had shot Wade.
According to his lawyer, he was given a bail of 350,000 dollars.
The office of the coroner of the East Baton Rose on Friday published a previous report, which states that the cause of death is a fire wound to the head and neck.
The Department is grateful to the Special Police Department for the search for fugitives from the state of Louisiana, the State Police Crime Lab, the University of the South Police Force, and the local citizens for their help in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of the University of Louisiana, Joe Alleve, thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their “dueness and desire for justice. ”
Sims was 20 years old.
Forward grew up in Baton Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
In the last season, the average result was 5.6 points and 2.6 picks.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at the University of Louisiana, Will Wade, said that the team was "desolate" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"That's what's bothering you all the time," Wade said.
The vulcan casts ashes on Mexico City
Popocatepetl’s ash has reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Warning Center on Saturday called on the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as the crater began to be active, and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center traced a lot of noises and pushes.
Photos on social media show thin layers of ash on the frontal cliff of motor vehicles in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Ogimilko.
Geophysics have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano, 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, following an earthquake of 7.1 points in Central Mexico in September 2017.
The vulcan, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The police ran into the Catalonist separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on a Saturday after protesters who were pro-independent met with the Special Police Division, and thousands of people joined protesters to mark the first anniversary of the Katalonia division vote.
A pro-separatist group with masks that were held back by the special purpose was putting them in eggs and powdered paint, which created dark clouds of dust on the streets, usually full of tourists.
The spores took place later on that day, and the police used the sticks to contain the aggression.
Within a few hours, groups of independenceists who were saying, "Let's not forget, let's not forget! ", ran into those who wanted to save the country, yelling, "Let's live Spain!".
According to a local press report, fourteen people have been helped with the light injuries sustained during the protests.
One year after the referendum, on 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid but marked by Catalan separatists, tension in the region, which wants to be independent, remains high.
The polls generally voted for independence, but the turnout was low, as most of the opponents boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people have been injured in brutal collisions last year as a result of the police's efforts to stop voting in elective areas throughout the region.
The independence groups spent the night on Friday in tents to prevent demonstrations to support the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it had to take a different route.
The 68-year-old Narcisse Termes, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, claimed he no longer had the hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"We've been through one of our best moments this past year.
I've been watching my parents weeping with joy, who can vote, but now we're in a dead end," he said.
Despite the vital but very complex triumph in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties, which are pro-independence, have not been able to maintain the momentum of this year, as many of their most prominent leaders are in voluntary banishment or imprisonment for their participation in the organization of the referendum and the further declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanist who withdrew a protest to support the police on the phone, claimed that the conflict was aroused by politicians on both sides.
"The stress is getting worse," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hongkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in the insulator since the end of last year, has announced that he will be running for the European Parliament next year.
“The status of a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regress of democratic values and reprisal we see from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: The men were arrested after the car entered the house.
Three men at the age of 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after the car entered a house in Londonderre on a number of occasions.
The incident took place in Balligard-Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in British standard time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings observed that the gate and the house itself had been damaged.
It is possible that at some point a crossbow was shot at the car.
Menga hit Livingston to win the Rangers with an account of 1-0
The first goal of Dolly Menga in Livingston was to win
High in the Livingstone class stunned the Rangers and brought Stephen Gerrard the second of 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
The hit by Dolly Menga was decisive: Gary Holt's team rose to one level in a second from the Cybernian.
Gerrard's team didn't win any take-off at the Premiere this season, and next Sunday, it's gonna play with the Harts leaders, from whom it's down eight points.
On Thursday, the Rangers will receive the "Rage of Wenen" within the European League.
In the meantime, Livingston has continued to make his unfailing move to the six Division games, and Chief Coach Holt has not been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone misses the odds that give indignity to visitors.
Holt's team was supposed to be ahead of them long before they killed them, as their directness creates all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson shattered through the defense, but hit down the gate, and then Alan Litgoe punched over the gate after he slammed in and accepted the Craig Hulquetta hit along the gate, which he made his head.
The landlords were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, and they knew that they could cause problems to the guests of the standard position.
So the final goal was hit.
The Rangers missed a free shot, and Livingstone opened up, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up Menga, who took the ball and shot it off the center of the fine.
The rangers were predominant in the use of the ball, but the protection of the landlords was inexperienced, and the gatekeeper, Liam Kelley, was mostly not disturbed.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos was able to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's punch hit Allan McGregor with his legs on the Rangers, and Litgoe hit the gate in another standard Livingston.
The naves continued to fly to the Livingston fine and were permanently neutralized, and the two penitentiaries — after the attack on Glenn Middleton and behind the game by the hand — were rejected.
Livingstone Phenomenon: analyzing
Alasdair Lamont from "BBC Scotland" at the Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Fenomeenal game and Livingston result.
All of them played well, and they continued to outperform the original trajectory.
Their style of play and composition has not changed much since they got back to the highest level, but you have to give Holt the right one for how he was mobilizing the team after he got here.
He's had so many heroes.
Captain Hulkett played grand, very well organized the defense, and Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Warral watchful.
The Rangers, however, were not inspired.
They used to play very well under Gerrard's direction, but now they're far from meeting those standards.
They didn't have the last ball -- just once they broke the field's landlords' defense -- and it was something like a wake up for the Rangers, which was in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was received in ambivalently in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, there was a glitter and a blue sky.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s conflicting visit to Germany, aimed at re-establishing relations among NATO allies.
There have been some controversies among them on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police have not let 25,000 people meet in front of the mosque, but a lot of the president's supporters have come to see it.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogon, among them many Kurds, have also made themselves heard, and they condemn Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
The bipartisan protest shows ambiguities of the guest, some of the Germans called a hero and others a dictator.
Depford Road Traffic Crash: The cyclist was hit by a car
The rider was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place at the Bestwood Street crossroads and Evelyn Street on a live road in the Deptford area in the south-east of the city at about 10:15 a.m. in the British Standard Time.
The driver stopped, and the paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man was killed on the spot.
The accident took place a few months after another cyclist died after a driver had escaped from an adventure on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from a Saturday accident.
The London Police stated that they were working on setting up a man to inform his next of kin.
Traffic has been banned and bus routes have been changed, and motorists are advised to avoid this zone.
Long-Lartin prison: Six prisoners are traumatized in an upheaval
Six of the prison staff have been injured as a result of the disturbances in the men's prison of strict security, and the prison administration has been informed.
Her Majesty Long-Lartin's prison in Woostershire began at about 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, the British standard time, and it's still going on.
In order to stop the upheaval, the eight incarcerated and colonized in the same fiery, a special unit called the Tornado was called up.
The officers have been given medical care in connection with light facial injuries at the scene.
A member of the Prison Service commented: “In order to address an incident in the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin, a specially trained prison staff was involved.
Six co-workers got medical treatment for the injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and the terms of their stay behind the bars can be doubled.
Her Majesty Long-Lartin's prison is over 500 incarcerated, including the most dangerous of the country's offenders.
In June, it was reported that the warden was sent to a state-of-the-art treatment after the prisoner's attack.
In October last year, the Special Police Department was called to the prison to stop the serious upheavals in which the jailers were assaulted with belliards.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flooding.
Tropic depression rarely hits Arizona, but this can happen at the start of the next week, as the rest of Hurricane Rose is heading through the southwest of the desert, posing the risk of a spill.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of spills on Monday and Tuesday, from West Arizona to South and East Nevada, South-East California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and it's gonna rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix observed in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950,
and Catrina in 1967 was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the border of Arizona.
According to the latest predictions of the National Hurricane Center, in the Mogollon-Rome area in Arizona is between 5.08 and 10.16 cm, and in places up to 15.24 cm of fall.
Other areas in the southwest of the desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Bayou, are likely to get from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of falls, with possible places up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of bad water, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region is suffering from a drought.
While flooding is a very serious problem, some of it is likely to be beneficial, as the south-west is now in a state of drought.
According to the American Dry Monitoring Center, a little over 40 percent of the area of Arizona is suffering from at least extreme drought, the second highest category of drought, reports Weather.com.
First of all, the way of Hurricane Rose is causing a cliff on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rose, still in the middle of a storm on Sunday morning with a maximum wind rate of 137 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at a rate of 19.3 km/h.
The storm is faced with a more cooler water in the Pacific, and so it erodes.
In this way, it is expected that the storm will cause a dislocation in Mexico in the wake of a tropical storm in the day or in the evening.
The number of fallouts in some parts of Mexico can be significant, creating a high risk of flooding.
“It is expected that the total number of falls from Lower California to North-West Sunora will be between 7.62 and 15.24 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm in space,” reportsweather.com.
Next, Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, get the border of Arizona early in the morning as a tropic depression, which will go further through Arizona and late in the evening on Tuesday to South Juta.
“The main danger that Rosa or her leftovers are expected is the very strong rains in Lower California, North-West Sonar, and Southwest American Desert,” reports the National Center for Hurricanes.
It is expected that these rains will result in life -threatening storms and streams of trash in the deserts, as well as in the cliffs in the mountainous area.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people are under arrest who have attempted to kill
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after they found a 16-year-old guy with a knife wound in Somerset.
He was found in Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton about 4:00 p.m. in British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in a stable state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested at night in the Radstock area, and reported to the Avon and Somerset Police.
The police are asking to respond to anyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Trump says Cavanaugh was "didded and angered" by the Democratic Party
“The voice of Judge Cavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and indignant tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump stated at a meeting in Wilinga, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavanaugh “did be mad and angered” by the Democratic Party throughout the hanging process.
Cavanaugh gave a witness to the Congress on Thursday, insidiously and emotionally denouncing the accusation of Christine Blazey Ford committing sexual violence against her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness at a hearing about the charges against her.
On Saturday, the president stated that “the American people saw Cavanaugh's brilliance, character, and courage on that day.
“The voice of Judge Cavanaugh is a voice for one of the most perfect jurists of our time, a legal practitioner with an impeccable experience in the public service,” he said to a mob of Western Virginia.
The president made a good reference to Cavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the presence of the Republicans in the mid-street elections.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lives will take place.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running,' he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats was to “oppose and hinder. ”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Cavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, and CNN has been told by one of the Republican leaders.
Hundreds of people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of casualties is on the rise.
At least 384 people have been killed, many have been washed into the ocean when massive waves hit the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, declared the country’s authority on Saturday.
Hundreds of people rested at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when a wave of up to six meters (18 feet) in the middle of the day hit the shore, killing a lot of people to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of 7,5 points.
“When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach, and they didn't start running, and they were the victims of it,” said a representative of the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) in Jakarta, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
“It was not just a tsunami, it was moving cars, woods, houses, it hit all the land,” said Nugroho, adding that, before it hit the shoreline, the tsunami passed through the open sea at a rate of 800 km/h (497 miles/year).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed on the trees and survived, he added.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palau.
The aerophotos published by the disaster management agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, the bridges have been rolled out and demolished, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
The push in the coastal city continued on the Sabbath.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy generated by the massive Friday earthquake was 200 times as much as the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hirosjima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have contributed to the forces of the tsunami, said the agency.
Nugroho called the loss “wide-scale” and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been demolished.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had been missing without a message.
Nugroho observed that the casualties and injuries can be more than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastline north of Pale in an area called Donggal, which is near the epicentre of the earthquake.
“The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we didn't get any information from Dongali,” said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, according to the Red Cross proclamation, and it is added that its personnel and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
“It's a tragedy, but it can be much bigger,” the report states.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for not saying that the tsunami hit Pale, even though the officials said the waves had come at the time of the warning.
From the amortized images that people shared in social media, you can see a man on the top of the building shouting wild warnings about how the tsunamis are approaching people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, the water wall hit the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to verify the reality of the frames immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a serious shutdown of the power that cut off the connection around Pale, which made it more difficult to coordinate the rescue.
The army began to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, and the authorities told them, but the evacuees still need food and other basic items.
The city airport was opened for help only, and it will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit evacuation centres in Palau on Sunday.
The number of people killed by tsunamis in Indonesia is more than 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision co-workers from Donggaly got to the city of Pale, where they hid in tarpaulins set up in the courtyard of their office, but on the way, they saw the scenes of desolation, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they've seen a lot of houses that have been demolished," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began to act decisively to deal with the consequences of the catastrophe, some complained that foreign aid workers with great experience were not allowed to go to Pale.
Under the Indonesian rules, financing, providing and providing personnel from abroad can only start if the place of disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It's still a disaster at the level of the province, ” remarked Aulius Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "Good, this is a national disaster," we can accept international aid, but this status has not yet been granted."
Already the second night fell on Pale after a Friday quake and a tsoon, and friends and families of those who had not yet been found still hoped that the appearance of their loved ones would be a miracle that would decorate these grim narratives of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy got out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers got a woman who for two days lay under the rocks with her mother’s body next to her.
Hendon Subandono, a trainer of the Indonesian national team with paraplaneracy, trained two disappeared paraplaners to participate in the Asian Games earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other para-planners who fell in the trap at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As an older paraplaner, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Ghendon tells us how, a few hours after the news about the ruin of the Roa Roa Hotel, which was spreading to the paralysing community, he was desperate to send a message to the WatsApp rivals of Pale, who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with just one grey headline, not a double-blue tick.
"I think it means that the message has not been delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26,750 when the ATM was refilled at the Newport on the Levie
On Friday morning, the thieves stole 26,750 dollars from a Brink employee who ran an ATM at the Newport on the Levie, a news report to the Newport Police Department.
The car driver emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex, and was preparing to add more money, writes Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man "running back to Brink's coworker" and stealing a bag of money to fill out.
The Witnesses spotted a number of suspects who fled the scene of the crime in the news, but the police did not indicate the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about these people should contact the Newport Police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The reper changes his name to E
Repper Kanye West changes his name to E.
On Saturday, when he announced a change on Twitter, he wrote, "Previously known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West was called E for a while, and he used this shortcut as a name for his June album.
The change took place in advance of his appearance on the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
In the show, he replaces Ariane Grande, who has cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", and the author of the show.
This is not just a shortening of the current trade name, and West used to say that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I believe 'ee' is the most common word in the Bible, and it means 'you' in the Bible,” West said earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with Big Boy radio-speakers. —
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The canyé, which means "one," has been shortened to just an E, is just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is one of a few well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Opady, P. Opady, and Granddad, has this year announced that he has chosen the name Love and Brother Love.
West's ex-coach, JAX, also experimented with defiance and big letters.
President Andres Manuel López Obrador of Mexico promises not to use the army against the civilians
Newly elected President Andres Manuel López Obrador of Mexico has promised never to use the army against the civilians, and the country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloodthirsty division of the students.
On Saturday, on the Talatelloloco Square, López Obrador promised to “never use the army to stifle the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, the military shot at a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing about 300 people, while the left student movements began to form throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to learners and by opening more free state universities.
He pointed out that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to crime groups.
U.S. has to double funding in the realm of artificial intelligence.
Since China is building up activity in the realm of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this field, and the investment and practice in the field of S.I. Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These comments were given after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about the MI, although there is no formal strategy in the U.S. in the field of the MI.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it wants to be number one in the S.I. Innovations until 2030.
“The double budget for the SIS would be a good start, considering that all the other countries are far behind the US, and we are preparing for the next break in the SIS,” said Lee.
Double-funding can double the probability that the next big advance in the field of HI will be made in the United States, said Lee in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book, The Power of the Sea: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director-general of the Foundation for Synovation Ventures, who has invested in Face++, one of China's best-known companies.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he was working on the SHI system, which played the best American player in Othello, and later the executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Philly Google.
Lee spotted a previous competition with technology by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Callenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research (DARPA), and asked when the next would be to help identify the next prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard to win state grants, says Lee.
"It's not China taking academic leaders, it's a corporation," he remarked.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been hiring a glove from universities in recent years to work on the CSI.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. to step up their efforts in the field of AI.
"I think the Green Card needs to be automatically offered to the PhD candidates," he said.
The State Council of China published its Plan for the Artificial Intelligence of the New Generation in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people working in academies, just like the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government agencies donate money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work in China below, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is intended to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House has announced the creation of a Special Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
As far as the National Science Foundation is concerned, it now invests over $100 million a year in a study of MI.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislature, who wanted to set up a Commission for the National Security of the Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any steps for a few months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia, on Sunday, voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to “the Republic of North Macedonia,” which will enable a long-term dispute to be resolved with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia’s possibility of membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the North Neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia's entry to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments entered into a treaty on the basis of a new name, but nationalist opponents of the treaty argue that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavonic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov has declared that he will not vote in a referendum, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the minimal 50 per cent of the voters will be able to see the referendum as valid.
The question in the referendum report is: “Do you support membership of NATO and the EU under the terms of the Greek deal?”
The adherents of the name change, including the Prime Minister of Zoran Zayev, say that this is a price that Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the break-up of Yugoslavia, should be paid to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young of Macedonia, so that it can live free under the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Oliver Georgiewski in Skopje.
While the result of the vote is not a legal obligation, enough members of Parliament have said they will support it to make it decisive.
To change the name, two thirds of the votes in Parliament will be needed.
The National Voting Commission stated that by 1:00 a.m. there was no report of an infraction.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters put their ballots in the trash.
"I've come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said the 62-year-old pick of Giosa Tanevski in the capital of Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Stroom, Macedonia, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zayev, his wife, Zorika, and his son Duško gave their vote in a referendum to change the name of the country, which would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Volodymyr Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and set up chairs in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go there with our head up proudly, not through the service door,” said the Cavardarks.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zion believes that joining NATO will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that most of our citizens are in favor, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” said Zayev after the vote.
He pointed out that the “yes” result would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43% of the voters will be in the referendum, and this is what is needed.
According to another survey carried out by the Macedonian TV Telema, 57% of the respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they'd vote for it.
For the referendum to be declared valid, it must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the politics of the Western Government since it began its work last May.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City goes all over Briton's defense and scores a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling went through Briton's defense and led Manchester City to win with a score of 2-0 on Saturday at the Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The Aguero Hall for the 65th minute of the match was a funny, simple one.
The Argentinian attacker got a pass at the center of the field at the start of the sequencing.
He ran between the three Britons and found himself in an open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He went round one defender, and then he ran a few more on the edge of the Briton.
And then he made a left pass, and he saw Sterling.
An English forward made the first touch on the penalty to give off the Aguero ball, which, with his right boot, launched it in the right part of the gate, defeating Matthew Ryan's Briton holkiper.
"Aguero has some problems with his legs," said the reporter's manager, "Pep Guardiola.
We agreed he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We're lucky he scored a goal at this moment."
But the initial advantage of the celestial-blue in this match was for Sterling.
The goal was 29 minutes ago.
Aguero got a ball deep in Briton.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along the left flank of Leroy Sane.
Leroy made a few touches, and he continued to pass Sterling in the direction of a long-distance posture.
Forward of the Celestial-Blue threw a ball at the gate just before he sprung out.
The City will meet Hoffhenheim in the group phase of the League of Champions at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Raine-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to take the points to "Roxis"
Since the Washington Nasionals team left the playoffs, there was no reason to wait for the next start.
But sherzer, who is prone to rivalry, hopes to go to the petcher bitterness on Sunday in a match against Colorado Rockies, on the condition that Roxie will still have difficulty getting out to playoffs. Now Roxie is one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League.
The Rockies have at least a Wild Card for their victory with an account of 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to secure the title of the first division.
"Although we're playing for nothing, at least we can leave the ball, knowing how the viewers are doing here in Denver, and the other team will probably play at the highest level I've seen this year.
Why don't I want to take part in this race?
The Nationals will still announce who's gonna be the starter on Sunday, but it's reported that they're leaning to it's gonna be Sherzer.
Sherzer, for whom it's gonna be the 34th start, has a pitching session on Thursday, and he can play on Sunday, his usual weekend.
The Washington right has a result of 18-7 of the 2.53 ERA and 300 strike outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Towns in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, when he spoke of the importance of the presence of Republican supporters in the mid-street elections.
"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lives will take place.
It's one of the big, big -- I don't run, but I'm really running, so I'm fighting for great candidates wherever I can," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, horrendous, radical group of Democrats, you see it's happening now.
And they're very well-configured to re-enter power, using any means, you see the vileness, the depravity.
They don't care who's suffering from them, who's the one who needs to get over to get power and control, they want power and control, we don't want to give it to them."
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is “to stand up and hinder.”
“And you've been seeing it for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “vilest and mean, vile and untrue.
He referred to the Senate Court Committee, naming Senator-Democrat Diane Feinstein by name, who led the audience to sound dissatisfaction.
"Remember her answer?
Did you submit the document?
Er, what.
No, uh, no, I'm looking forward to -- it was a really bad language of the body rovers -- the worst language of the body rovers I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a big church.
It is incomprehensible to those who express their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to sue me, it was not much of a surprise.
After all, I'm the last of those Labour Members of Parliament to be told they're not happy, and all this is because we're expressing our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated almost the same way because she was determined to stand up to anti-Semiticism.
I was convicted for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
As for the importance of responsible economic policy, as far as national security is concerned with Europe, these issues are ironicly similar to those on which Jeremiah disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East meeting on Friday states, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the evenings of the General Committee's five-year General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Laborists have been like this.
Sadly, today many encounters have a very different tone, and the promise of “more benevolent, softer” politics has long been forgotten if it has ever been implemented.
It is becoming more and more clear that the Labour Party does not have a different view, and every thought is valued from the position of whether it is acceptable to lead the Party.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, and the circles with which I thought I had the same political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and to take a position I would never agree with, whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I speak in public -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- it's followed by a tirade of attacks in social networks with calls for a rebuke, a conviction of the center's politics, and I'm told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know what I'm luckier than some of my co-workers, because the comments I've been getting are usually political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those coworkers who face the streams of sexist or racist attacks every day, but never refuse.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour Party should be promoting a culture of tolerance.
Reality is that we are no longer such a big church, and with every move of distrust or change in the rules of selection, the party is narrowing down.
For the last two years, I've received a lot of advice, and I've been told not to stand up, not to say so loudly, that I'm "everything's going well."
But that's not why I'm in politics.
I joined the laborers 32 years ago, a schoolboy, because the lack of attention from the Tetcher government has caused my high school class to fall apart, and since then I've wanted to improve the quality of public services for those who need it most, whether it's a local councilman or a government minister.
I never hid my policy, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been perplexed by my political views and differences with the current leadership.
For those who contributed to the Friday event, I just want to say one thing: in the context of a country moving to Brexit, which would harm the homes, businesses, and public services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for Nottingham Time, but for my choice, as members of the Labour Party, and no: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to repel me, and no political will will stop me from acting in line with what I think is the best interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayre invinces up
The last two trys may have misled the end result, but there is no doubt that Air has earned a triumph in today's excellent entertaining match, the premiership of Scotland.
Now they're in charge of the table, this is the only command of ten that can't be won.
After all, the excellent defense and improved ability to take advantage of the chances gives the landlords and Coach Peter Merchi the full right to be content.
"We've been through our game trials so far, and we're still invincible, so I have to be content," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose commented, "I give due "Eir, they've been better at taking the chance than we are."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, carried out by Frazier Climo, led Air ahead, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, released by Verriors, allowed Melrose to show the numbers, and Jason Baggott used an unrealized attempt.
Climo reinforced Air's leadership with a penny, and right before the break, he made and made a solo try, giving 17-5 for Air.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half, and the try of Patrick Anderson, implemented by Buggot, narrowed it down to five points.
Afterwards, there was a continued delay due to the serious trauma of Rouard Knott, who was pulled out of the field on the load, and from the Ayre re-start, they ran ahead with a try by Stafford McDowell, which was carried out by Climo.
Captain Blair McPherson then had a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another player to pay Bruce Colvin's unfulfilled attempt under intense pressure.
The landlords returned, but when Strawan Hutchinson got a yellow card for seizing Climo without a ball from the line of the penalty box, MacPherson made a touchdown behind the Air mold.
Climo tried what he was doing almost every time after reset, and then Kyle Rowe got a hit from David Armstrong in the box and sent a flunker to Gregor Henry at the fifth try of the owner's team.
Looks like the star of the "Already a game" series was set up for a new career in the restaurant realm.
Seems like the star of the "Already Play" series, Ford Kieran, is set up for a new career in the field of hospitality, and this is what you can conclude after it has become known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor is playing Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC TV show, a script he writes to and in which he is filming an old comedy partner, Greg Hemfield.
Duette announced that the future 9th series would be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning a life after Craigslist.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though the source at Scotty Sun suggested that Kirnan wanted to enter the "prosperous restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"The Sea of Ours": Inside Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling a well-equipped navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings are hoisting an ocean-blue flag.
The seabases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are a motto: "The sea is right.
We have to get it back."
Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, still has a memory of the loss of the coastline, which left Chile in the bloodthirsty conflict of the 19th century over natural resources, as well as a desire to swim again in the Pacific.
These hopes are probably the strongest in the last decade, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the international court on October 1, after five years of hearing the case.
“ Bolivia has an impulse, a spirit of unity and tranquillity, and, of course, it expects a positive result,” Roberto Calçacia, a Bolivian diplomat, commented.
A lot of Bolivians will be watching the announcement of the ICJ decision on big screens all over the country, and they expect a court in Haiti to take a decision in the favor of Bolivia, that after a decade of insidious chatter, Chile will be in a position to negotiate for Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who met up with his reconfiguration next year, also puts great hope in a decision to be announced on Monday.
"We're very close to getting back to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in Bolivia’s favor, and if it does, there will be little change.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to condemn Chile’s territory and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ decision was made only six months after the final argument was put forward indicates that the case was “not complicated”, told Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Bolivia's case has not progressed, and the last four years have been able to contribute to the rollback.
“The demand for access to the sea has been used by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
Morales’ war-torture erupted the remains of Chile’s benevolentness, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to have a discussion.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Edouard Rodriguez Weltse, a Bolivian representative in Haiti, disagreed that the court’s approval was uncommonly fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be “an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of Chile’s relationship and a chance to end the 139th year of differences by enjoying mutual benefit, ” he said.
California also denied that Morales, still one of Latin American’s most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as a politician.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
This order is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.
North Korea says there's no nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the US.
Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho of North Korea says that his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to live up to the promises made in Singapore by the leaders of the opponent countries.
His comments appeared when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be on the verge of relaunching nuclear diplomacy, which went to a deaf end more than three months after Singapur alone with Kim Chen In.
Ri says that the belief that the continuation of the sanctions and the United States declaration of the end of the Korean war will one day put North Korea on the knees is a “incessant dream. ”
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is a common scepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the abandonment of his arsenal, which the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second alone between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show presented the latest trend of massive main decorations, which is already heading on the main street of your city
If you want to expand your hat collection, or to hide completely from the sun, you've found what you need.
Valentino's designers and Tom Brown have shown a number of excentrical basics in the style of the Operas from the spring-summer 2019 event of the brilliant Paris fashion week.
Very impractical hats filled Instagram this summer, and the designers named have already sent their insatiable creations out of the range.
Valentino turned out to be an extravagant beige hat with a wide-fed field that covered the model's head.
Among the other outlets of the axes are decorated with precious stones of coffee, the hat of the sorcerer, and even the hat of the ananas, but they are not to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also displayed an assortment of original masks — very in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks had their lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high fashion.
One of the creations was like an underwater swab with tubes and eyeglasses, and the other looked like a crack of frost that melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
Stylists say that big hats can go out on the main street in your city.
The Opera-Capple has become fashionable thanks to the La Bomby, a straw hat with a field of 60 cm wide, which was seen on all, from Rianni to Emily Rataškowski.
The cultural brand, which is behind a very impractical hat, which has been seen everywhere in social media, has given the world another creation: a straw bag of the size of a beach bag, almost as a model in a bathing suit that carried it.
A bag of yellow-red raffia with a rag of raffia and a white skin pen was the center of a collection of La Riviera spring-literally 2019 brands of Jacquemus on the Paris fashion week.
Celebrity Stilist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "In the coming summer, I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets of the city, for the designer’s influence is so immense that it will be hard to ignore the demand for an ops-axis.
John Edward: Knowledge of the language is a duty of the world's citizens
Scotland’s independent schools maintain high standards of study, and in 2018 they again have excellent results in the field of individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other fields.
These schools, with more than 30,000 students in Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SHED), and they want to provide the best level of service for the students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for the further and higher education they have chosen for their career, as well as to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language she understands, she takes it with her mind.
If you talk to her in her native language, she takes it in her heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't just use English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the most recent results of this year's examinations, we see that in independent schools, language is used in ratings of things with the best ratings.
In total, 68% of the students who studied the foreign languages got a higher A.
Data from 74 schools in the SSRS show that 72% of the students got a higher A from Chinese, and 72% from German, 69% from French, and 63% from Spanish, also got A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital to the life skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Now, language as an object of choice is taught in the same way as NTIM (scientific, technical, engineering, and math), in independent school programs, and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Jobs and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that 17% of the reasons why employers cannot close vacancies due to a lack of language skills.
So language skills are increasingly needed to train young people for a future career.
As more and more promising positions are needed to learn languages, these skills are needed in a globalizing world.
No matter what kind of career you choose, if you learn a second language, you'll have a real future advantage, because it's a life-long skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks a number of languages the advantage of competitors.
According to a 2013 YouTube survey of over 4,000 British adults, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and French was the only language in which a two - sized percentage of people (15%) spoke.
That's why investment in language teaching is now important to modern-day children.
Knowledge of a number of languages, especially those in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding a full - time job.
In Scotland, each school will learn their own languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages that are considered to be the most important to Britain from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child in independent schools, it will always be possible to select a number of languages to study with qualified teachers.
Scotland’s independent schools are trying to create an educational environment that prepares children and armes them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future is.
Now it can't be denied that in the international business environment, languages continue to be vital to a future country, so it has to be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be viewed as “the masters of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to give this choice, diversity, and perfection to Scottish youth.

Liebron debuts with Lakers in San Diego
The fans who want to see the first start of Librane James for Los Angeles Lakers are about to wait.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play on Sunday in the first pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes it's gonna play, not yet decided.
"This will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers Web site.
Reporter Mike Trudell reported that James would play a limited number of minutes more quickly.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six pre-season games of the Lakers.
"In this phase of my career, I don't need pre-season games to train," he replied.
Trump in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is now starting a series of pre-elective rallies from the city of Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five Trump meetings planned for next week, including those in the friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidacy he offered to the Supreme Court has been postponed, and Trump is eager to form support for future mid-town elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress after voting in November.
What time will today’s Trump’s evening meeting in West Virginia take place, and how can we look at it on the Internet?
Trump's meeting in the city of Wiling in West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours in the East today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia online down on YouTube live.
Trump will probably refer to the strains of the hearing this week on a candidate in the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, who is being charged with sexual harassment, and the postponement of the Senate vote for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main purpose of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans to become more popular before the November elections.
President Trump's representatives stated that these five meetings next week are focused on “activation of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand the majority of the people in the Senate and House of Representatives,” reports Reuters.
“The control of the Congress is so critical to its day order that the president will go to as many states as possible, as the turbulent pre-electoral campaign season is coming,” said Reuters, a representative of the Trump campaign, who has not wanted to name his name.
At the Vesbanko Arena Stadium in the city of Wiling, today's meeting can be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as by the media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's visit will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the last month, where he won over 40% of the votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate from the Republican to the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisy, whose ratings are behind the polls.
“ This is not good for Morrisy, who the president is coming to raise his polls, ” commented Reuters Simon Heather, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Rider Cup 2018: The United States team is set up to fight and is filled with hope for the Sunday singles
After three sessions, which ended in a one-sided victory, the Saturday forsaw can be exactly what this Ryder Cup was missing.
The swing pendulum of the impulse is a completely fictional sporting concept in which the players really believe, especially in such a race.
So when do they say the impulse works?
"They were six points ahead, and now four, so I think we're gonna take it a little bit like an impulse," Jordan Spit said when he left.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points ahead and 12 more in the game.
The Americans, as Spit says, feel a bit of wind in their windmills, and they're also encouraged by a lot, not the last time, by Spit and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, and everyone has made three out of four.
Spit and his killer punches from the midget to the game show an example.
The larynx cries of the festivities became louder when in the continuation of his round he made a critical path and levelled the score at the fourth match after he and Thomas had been two points behind.
His patt, who let them win a match on the 15th hole, met with a similar yell, one that tells you that the American team doesn't seem.
"You really just have to try hard and worry about your own game," Spit said.
That's all each of these players left now.
18 holes to be known.
The only player with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the irrefutable history of the Ryder Cup.
It's unusual, but a charming couple in Europe has four out of four and can't make any mistakes.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogo on Saturday afternoon, and they also managed to escape a bogo on Saturday morning and after lunch on Friday and the nine last holes on Friday morning.
This run, and the way their energies seem to flow to this turbulent crowd and back, makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players, other than Fleetwood or Molinari, to secure the potential victory of the Europeans when the sun hits Le Golf National.
Both are desirable at the same time on different holes.
But it's too early to talk about the European triumph.
Bubba Watson and Webb Sampson got off with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning tubs, when he was in a relationship with Alex Noren.
One bogogo and two dabs on the first nine holes led the Spaniard and the Swede to a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of the hole.
Foreballs and foresomes are very interesting to see close to each other because of the interaction between the couple's members, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and it's interesting to see how a strategy can change in a moment.
So far, Europe is playing better than a team and has a lot of advantage in the last day, but this session of forsoms has also shown that the US team is going to fight what some, especially Americans, are questioning.
Europe is leading with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
On the closing day of the Rider Cup, Europe will have a common advantage, for after the Saturdays, it's ahead of the United States with a score of 10-6.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have won two victories over Tiger Woods, and now on Le Golf National, they have four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to get the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning forts with a 3-1.
The U.S. was more uptight in the forsoms and won two matchbacks, but it was not possible to shorten the breakup.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to save the trophy.
Fleetwood, the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Mollinari (one Mallywood) after a sensational weekend are just the second pair to win four points in the first four games in the history of the Rider Cup.
After cracking up Woods and Patrick Reed in fortballs, they united to win the swelling Woods and the American new Bryson Deshambo with an even more effective 5th.
Woods, who pulled out two matches on Saturday, was displaying an incidental splash of genius, but he now loses 19 of his 29 matches in forbes and fors and seven matches in a row.
Justin Rose, who didn't take part in the morning tubs, went back to Henrik Stanson's partner in the forsoms to get a hit with a score of 2001 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Tepka, which is the first and third of the world's ratings.
Europe has not been able to do everything in its own way this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, the three major winners, set the standard for Americans on Saturday with their two points.
They won a decisive victory over the Spaniards, John Ram and Ian Polter, in the foreballs, and later won Polter and Rory McLray with a score of 403 in the fors, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returned with a four-point deficit in the singles, even though Furick's team needed nothing to save the trophy.
After the second place in two days, however, the counterattack on Sunday looks like it can't.
North Korea says that "not at all" will not be disarmed in one-sided order without trust
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs on Saturday told the United Nations that the extension of the sanctions would deepen the distrust of the United States, and that under such circumstances the country would never be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations General Assembly every year that last year, North Korea had put in place “the available measures of good will”, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and a commitment not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Well, we don't see the response from the US," he said.
“Untrusting the US will not be our national security, and under such circumstances we will never be the first to disarm in one-sided order.”
And while Rhee was repeating North Korea’s familiar grievances about Washington’s “phase-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for the step-by-step steps, his claim was important because it did not reject the one-sided denuclearization that Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chen In and Donald Trump on the first-ever single-handed position between the real United States president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for a “declaration of the Korean Peninsula”, and Trump promised a security guarantee to North Korea.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950–53 Korean War, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to weaken the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on "declaration at first" and increases the level of pressure by means of sanctions to reach its goal by force, and even denies "the end of the war," Rhee said.
“Consider that the sanctions can put us on our knees, ” the unfulfilled dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the extension of the sanctions deepens our distrust.
Ri didn't mention the plans of the second one between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader emphasized at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added, "If South Korea, and not the United States, would not be the party to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."
Despite this, the tone of Ri’s speech was starkly different from the point of view when he told the General Assembly that the North Korean missile attack on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after the “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a“rakete man ” who wanted to commit suicide.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “make up ” North Korea, lauded Kim for his courage in taking action on disarmament, but said that much more needed to be done and the sanctions needed to stay in place until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump observed that he was not setting a time limit for this: "It will take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
But US task force Mike Pompeo announced to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue with energy and without hindrance until we see a complete, final, confirmed denuclearization. ”
The Security Council has once again increased its sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of blocking the financing of nuclear and ballistic Pyongyang rockets.
Pompeo met Ri in the halls of the United Nations General Assembly and then said he was visiting Pyongyang again the next month to get ready for the second one.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was a failure.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but after a few hours, North Korea convicted him of “gangster demands. ”
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has promised to address the missile system, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States is taking “suitable action”.
He said that, according to Kim, he needed the “adversarial measures” to be the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore, and steps to normalize his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a class on how to get enough rest
The new course at Harvard University this year provided all of its students with more sleep, an attempt to combat the growing culture of the steepness of learning all night after refilling with caffeine.
The student found that University number one students in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigam Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first in the United States.
He decided to start a course after giving a lecture on the effect of sleep deprivation on his studies.
At the end, one girl approached him and said, "Why do they say this to me in the last class?"
“She told her that no one ever talked to her about the importance of sleeping, which amazed me, ” said a teacher from The Telegraph.
In the course that was first introduced this year, students are taught the basics of how good sleeping habits help to achieve academies and sports, as well as to improve global well - being.
Paul Barrera, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and Executive Director of the University of Medicine, said that the University had decided to introduce a course after it had been found that the students had been seriously sleepless for a week.
The one-time course includes a number of interactive to-dos.
In one section, there's an image of a room in a cottage, where students click cups of coffee, curtains, trainers, and books to learn about the effect of caffeine and light, the effect of sleep deficient on sports, as well as the importance of sleeping-related routines.
Another chapter tells participants how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, the online icon map encourages the participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know this won't change the student's behavior in a moment.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Chesler.
A culture of pride for “singing all night ” still exists, he added, and also pointed out that modern technology and the ever-growing pressure on students means that the problem of sleep deprivation is on the rise.
Sufficient sleep of good quality must be the student's “secret weapon” to deal with stress, wearout, and anxiety, even with a set of overweights, as sleep deprivation translates the brain into hunger, which causes a constant physical hunger, he told us.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chessler to develop a course after he was enrolled in one of his other classes last year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all aspirants to attend a similar program before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Chessler recommends that students be reminded to go to bed, and to set up an alarm and to be aware of the harmful effect of the “blue light” that e-screens and light-driving lamps have on the world, and that can disrupt the circadian rhythm, which can cause problems with swelling.
Livingstone 1-0 Rangers: Mengo's goal emboldened Gerrard's boys
The Rangers experienced a queue attack of outburst: a hit by Dolly Menga led to a separate Stephen Gerrard team in a 1-0 from Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first win at the game after the lute triumph over St. Johnston with a 4-1 account, but the Gary Holt team gave Gerrard a second win as a manager of 18 games. Gerrard's team left eight points behind the Scottish Premiership Harts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, which lacked inspiration, didn't look like it could match the score.
Now, "Rengers down to the sixth position, and Livingstone up to the third position, and by the difference of the ball, they're just ahead of the Hibernian.
The Rangers may also have another problem, as the Linsman of Kalum Spence was forced to process the head wound after he was thrown into the guest sector with an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that once hit Air in the halffinal of the Scots League Cup.
And Holt released the same set of "Livy 11", which took one point to the Harts last week, and was fascinated by the way his swamped boys put up rivals at every point.
The Rangers may have been dominating the ball, but Livingstone was working more with the ball.
They were to kill in just two minutes of the game, when the first pass of Menga in the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit the gates of Allan McGregor, but the half-defendant was wasted this big chance by sending a ball over the gate.
Deep free shot by Keahan Jacobs got Skipper Craig Hulkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgoe hit the back pan
Rangers did get control, but on the last third there was more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he should be entitled to a four-hour pension after the encounter with Stephen Lawless, but Stephen Thomson's referee rejected the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers managed to hit only two of the gates in the first half, but the former Ibrox gatekeeper, Liam Kelley, was hit with the head of Lassana Kulibali and a quiet hit by Oviet Jejaria, was almost inconvenient.
And while the 34-minute outpost of Livingston may have been in conflict with the game, no one can deny that they just earned it with their hard work.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' preparations.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly selected Mengoe for a simple end.
In the break, Gerrard replaced the Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the vinger got to Morelos, but the astonishing Kelley snuck out of his line to block it.
But Livingstone continued to force the guests to play the same game they like when Litgoe and Halletta make one long pass after the other.
Holt's team could have improved the results in the last stages, but McGregor was very good with Jacobs before Litgo was hit out of the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for the Rangers, made another late application for a fine when he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson again took a look.
Almanac: Geiger’s Compiler Inventor
And now the page from our Sunday morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and the time is going to go ... in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as Geiger's count.
From then on, the numeric Geiger has become a key element of science, as well as a key element of pop culture, for example, in the 1950 "Call the Coronado" movie with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play dubious-looking cowboys.
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger's count used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on those headphones, you can really hear the effect on atoms of radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: "Oh, wow, it's really cracking right now!"
"Gans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that carries his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method presupposes the removal of immune cells in the patient and their change in the lab.
And then these cells are able to "see" proteins, which is common to many types of cancer, and then these cells are injecting the patient again.
Testing vaccines show promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method is to remove the immune cells from the patient, to change them in the lab so that the cells can "see" common to many types of protein cancer (HER2), and to continue to reintroduce these cells to the patient.
Professor J. Berzofski of the United States National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, states: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.
"HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorful cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which is to delete immunocells in patients and “teaching” them to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of one of the types of leukemia.
After a show of SNL in a MAGA cap, Kanye West strung out with a sharp talk to support President Trump,
the negative response of the viewers
The audience at SNL Studios (Sunday Night in Direct Episode) learned Kanye after his sad presentation, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for the presidency in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town, in a baseball cap labeled "Return America's Past Fame", he exploded with a tirade in which he criticized the Democrats, and again claimed his support for Trump.
"A lot of white people talk to me, "how do you like Trump? He's a racist."
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began with Matt Damon's sketch, in which a Hollywood star laughed at Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Juridical Committee in a case of Christian Blazey Ford's sexual assault.
Although West's speech was not aired in the live air, Chris Rock's social media comedian made a video of his tirade.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to laugh at West by posting this post.
West also complained to the viewers that he was in the middle of a bad situation because of the main cleanup.
As the Washington Examiner reports, West said, "When I was behind the bars, I was brutally treated.
I was told, "Don't go to the viewers in this baseball cap."
They bullied me!
And then they tell me I'm in a place where the oppressed are silent."
West continued, "Do you want to see a place where the oppressed are silent? I'm gonna put on my superman cap, because so no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to keep moving?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to a weekly report by Variety, his comments at least twice triggered a negative response by the audience in the room, and the actors in the SNL show seemed to be confused, and one of the viewers said, "The studio is still quiet."
Westa was last-minutely invited to replace Ariane Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Reper McMiller, died a few days before the air.
West was surprised to do a song I Love it (I love it) in a suit of Perrier water.
Westa was supported by the head of a conservative organization, TPUSA Kendez Turner, who tweeted: "One of the brightest:
Instead, the host of the talk show, Karen Gunther, wrote on Twitter that the West "is who he is, and it's just great."
"I don't want to reward him (buying his music or his dress or supporting his "the art") who, in my opinion, professes and casts out an ideology that harms my community.
He's a free man.
Like us," she added.
Prior to the show, a rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name: he was now "the one who was once known as Kanye West."
West is not the first artist to change his name, he's following the example of grandpa, also known as Puff grandpa, Puffy, and Pi grandpa.
Snoop Dog's collegiant used to be called Snoop Lyon, and, as we know, the music legend of the last decades, Prince changed the name to a symbol, and then he became "Artist, formerly known as Prince."
Charged for wilful murder after a knife attack at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is charged with a premeditated murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The police reported an incident at the Belligecamor Restaurant.
The accused is expected to be brought before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will look into the charges.
The Star of the Grey of Thrones, Keith Görington, denounces the idealization of bruteness.
The role of a soldier with a sword, John Snow, in the ruthless medieval Phensium series "The Grave of Thrones" of HBO, has become a prominent feature.
But a 31-year-old actor denounced the stereotype of a hero-macho, saying that through such characters on screens, young boys often feel like they have to be cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said that "something went wrong" and asked how to address the problem of idealization of bruteness in the era of popularity of the hashtag #Meto.
The cat, who recently got married to his collaborator on the Grey Thrones, a 31-year-old actor, Rose Lesley, said that he was "really determined" to deal with the problem.
"I'm now pretty determined, when we're on the slippery path of idealizing bruteness?" he asked.
"What do we teach future men if we look at their growing up from the perspective of the problem we see now?"
The whale believes that TV is part of the responsibility for popularizing bruteness through images of very brave heroes.
He continued, "What's natural, and what do we get?
Why does TV and the street teach that young boys are under pressure to be such men?
I think today is a really important question, "How do we change this?"
'Cause it's obvious that the young guys are out of the right way."
In an interview, he also pointed out that he would not be filming in any prequel and cycwells of "Gree Thrones" after the end of the show the next summer, because "he's already done with the battles and the horse."
As of November, Kit will play "The Real West" by Sam Shepard – the story of the movie producer and his rogue brother.
As the actor recently confessed, he considered the meeting with his wife Rose the best he'd ever received from the Grey of Thrones series.
"From the time of the filming in this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and defined my life," said the cat.
In a feminine series that won the Emmy award, Rose played the game, the love of the hero Gerington John Snow.
The couple got together in June 2018, and the ceremony was held in Lesley's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% sharp increase in new cases
In China, a sharp 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has been reported.
According to health authorities, there are more than 820,000 people in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted by sex, which is a sign of a change in the past.
For a long time, in some parts of China, HIV has been rapidly spread through infected blood during blood transfusions.
But, according to official health officials at a conference in Yunnan, the number of people who are HIV-infected in this way has fallen to almost zero.
Compared to the previous year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV by sex at times is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but LGBT people are often discriminated against.
According to the studies, 70 to 90% of men who have sex with other men are married to women in the future because of the country's existence of conservative values.
In most cases, the transfer of the disease is due to the misuse of the means of protection in the course of sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV treatment, in a way that will address the problem in part.
Maxine Waters denies the spill of data from the senator-respondents online by her full-time employee, and is critical of "threatening lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, a member of the United States House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, denounced the allegation that one of her full-time employees had posted the individual data of three American senator-rescue senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The L.A. Democrat claims that these statements are spreading "Ultra-right" political viewers and websites.
"Little, lies, and then even more disgusting lies," Waters said in Twitter.
Reportedly, the public information contained the home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lyndsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch of Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday, and it was posted by an unknown man from the Capitol during a hearing before the Senate Commission for charges of sexual misconduct committed against Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the position of Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
Data spilled out a while after three senators interrogated Cavanaugh.
The Hill has reported that on such conservative websites as Gateway Pundit and RedState, information has been provided that the IP address of the source of the outflow is linked to the Waters office and has been able to locate the data of its full-time co-worker.
"These unsubstantiated statements, absolute untrue, do not match the reality," said Waters.
"The half-worker of my office, whose personal data and security are at risk as a result of these fabricated and false statements, has nothing to do with the outflow of this information.
These unsubstantiated statements are absolute untrue, they don't match the reality."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, and among others, the former White House Spokesman, Ari Fleisher, was quoted.
"This denial is filled with anger," writes Fluisher.
"This suggests that with this character, she cannot be a member of Congress.
If a person is accused of what he has not done, he does not need to be angered.
The accused should not be dishonest.
He should not ask about the motives of the accused.
He has to stay calm and unstoppable."
It seems that Fleisher was running parallels between Waters' response and the Democratic critique at the address of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused of being too mad at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is trying to take Waters' place after the results of the inter-elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"This is news, if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had already informed "the responsible state and legal authorities of these false claims."
"We will do our best to find the guilty," she continued, "and they answered the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
"Agent Johnnie Inglich: New Mission" – a pass-by parade for spying with Rowen Atkinson
It's already a good tradition to look in every new British movie for Brixit's wits, and they're in a new part of a series of comedy jokes on Johnny Inglich, and the first film, "Johnnie Inglich", was released in 2003, and the series was re-renewed in 2011 after "Johnnie Inglich: Restarting".
Will the ironic and ironic self-satisfaction of what we are a misguided, new export potential of the nation?
One way or another, Johnny Inglich with his moving face and shaved eyes was again able to make a mess, with his name more than anything, indicating that this comedian character was created for non-English-language viewers.
As we know, Johnnie is a funny secret agent who, despite his bizarre attempt to be gallant and charming, is a bit from Inspector Clouseau, a bit from Mr. Bean, and a lot of things – from the guy who played one note of the movie "Fire chariots" at the opening of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
The character is also foreshadowed by a wanderer and a riddle of international magnitude, which has always left behind the mess that Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten TV commercial by Barclaycard.
In the last movie about Johnny Inglich, there are a few good things.
I loved the scene when Johnny Inglich, in his boots, was approaching the helikopter, and the spades of the penny day on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent to set up a buffalo, but humors pass, and in some respects it's too much, especially when compared to "serious" movie, such as Agent 007 and "Mission Impossible," one of the "Ingredients" of which is also a comedy.
It seems to me that the jokes are more focused on children than on adults, and I don't seem as ingenious and thoughtful as atkinson in the silent Bin movies.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
The British super-secret spy network is infiltrated by a hacker and uncovers the names of all field agents, which has become a total surprise to an active agent (apparently, Kevin Eldon played an episodic role in the movie).
This proved to be the last part of the prime minister, a haughty person who has already been subjected to a critique and is in deep depression due to the loss of popularity ( Emma Thompson has been trying to get the best picture that Theresa May has been able to interpret, but the script has not been able to uncover it.
Recon counselors have informed her that all active agents have been compromised, and she has to involve one of the retired.
The choice falls on the unspeakable Johnny Inglich, who is now a teacher in some super-model institution and informally teaches children to work under cover (in this part, with the spy "year's school" in England, there were a few good jokes for teenagers).
The Inglisha is quickly taken to Whitehall for a short-term breeze, where he meets again with his long-suffering friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller for the next time.
Buff is now married to a captain of a submarine (the role of an exalted irritant person does not exactly match the talent of Vicky Pepperdin).
So, when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty went squeaky, the Batman and Robin are back in line and suddenly meet the fatal woman of Ophelia Pistoletov, played by Olga Kurilenko.
And at this time, the prime minister falls under the spell of a charismatic billionaire, who has made his wealth in technology and technology, and claims that he can fix the problem with the British network, the vile Jason Volt, who was played by Jake Lacey.
Inglish and Buff go on a trip and re-enter their funny boots: re-dressed by waiters, they're setting fire in a fancy French restaurant; then they're sowing chaos, illegally moving abroad on Volta's luxurious yacht; and Inglish is setting up a real mess when he's trying to use the wheel of virtual reality to get to know how to plan Volt's house.
All the stops are leading us to the last epic, but with his kindness and fury, he is something like a movie for children.
Walking movie.
Like watching other Johnnie Inglich movies, I asked myself the same question: Can the British movie industry not offer Rowena Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
Laborers deny the preparation of a plan according to which the British will work four days a week, but will receive a wage in five days.
Jeremy Corbina's Labour Party has to talk about a radical plan, according to which the British will work four days a week, but get a wage in five days.
It is reported that the party wants to require company managers to transfer the money saved by the revolution of the artificial intelligence to the employees, giving them an extra way out.
In this way, the workers will have a three-day vacation and bring home the same wage.
According to the sources, this idea will be in line with the Party's economic program and direct the country's resources to support the work class.
The move to a four-day working week was approved at the British Congress of the Third United States, and it is expected that the workers will be able to benefit from a change in the state-of-the-art situation.
The source in the Labour Party reported to The Sunday Times: "Policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week is in line with the Party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party.
Laborers were not the first to adopt such an idea, as the Green Party promised to set up a four-day work week during the pre-electoral campaign of 2017.
But not all members of the Labour Party are now in favor of such a desire.
The Spokesman of the Labour Party stated, "The political program of the Party has no four-day work week, so we don't think about it now."
"The Shadow" chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at last week's pre-electoral meeting of the Labour Party.
Mr. McDonnell claimed that he was set up to take back power from the "faceless directors" of the Communal Industries and the "visitors."
The "Black Chancellery" plan also means that water company stockers can not get all of their share of the capital if the Labour government puts in place a "counter" on the basis of an imaginary infraction.
He also affirmed his intention to include employees in company rule and to set up inclusive fund-raising to pass 10 per cent of the private sector’s share to the workers, who are expected to receive an annual dispensation of up to £500.
Lyndsey Grame and John Kennedy talk on 60 Minutes, or can the FBI-led Cavanaugh case change their mind.
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh, who is in charge of the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court has been postponed at least a week, and the question arises whether the senators of the press will continue and continue to support Cavanaugh after the results of the investigations of the bureau have been made public.
On Sunday's 60 Minutes, Correspondent Scott Pelli asked the senators, John Kennedy and Lyndsey Graham, if the FBI could find something to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina coworker.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
During the hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Cavanaugh.
I phoned him after it happened and the charge came out, and I asked him, "Did you really do it?"
He was determined, steadfast, uncompromising."
It seems that Graham’s mind will no longer change.
"I think Cavanaugh's indictment is a provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," he said, "and he said to Christin Blaze Ford.
And everyone she calls can't prove it under oath.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't know what can change."
What is Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect the decline in poverty?
On this Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival – an annual event in the music world, with a staggering number of stars and an equally devastating mission – to combat global poverty.
During the seventh festival, the Global Citizen Festival will have tens of thousands of people mob in the Grand Gaul of Central Park, not just to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendez, but also to draw attention to the true purpose of the festival – the organizers want to overcome the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global People's Project, an international public organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are active in fighting it.
To get a free ticket for an event (unless you want to pay a VIP card), visitors have to do a number of jobs or "acts", such as taking a volunteer project, emailing the world's leader, making a phone call or something to help draw attention to the organization's goal of eradicating poverty.
So are there any results, since the Global Citizen organization has 12 years left to complete the goal?
Is it really the idea of rewarding the actions of a free concert, a brilliant way to convince people to do something, or is it just another case of so-called "cliktiveism" when people feel that something is really changing by signing an e-mail or by doing a Twitter release?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have identified 19 million “acts” of their adherents focused on different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to declare planned financial allocations and programs for more than $37 billion, which will help to change the lives of more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 financial commitments and public statements as an example, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
The group has estimated that the cost has affected the lives of some 649 million people all over the world.
The Power of Nutration, which is part of the United Kingdom, is one of the major financial responsibilities of the project. In the framework of the project, investors and implementers committed themselves to "helping the kids to grow up" and pledged to give Rwanda $35 million in help to cope with the problem of undernutrition after having received more than 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"For the support of the British government, the mercenarism, the governments of other countries, and the citizens of the world, like you, we can make the social problem of undernutrition a small fact of history," said a representative of The Power of Nutrition Tracy Wallman, speaking to the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 "acts" that called for better nutrition for mothers and children, the British government had announced the release of funds for the Power of Nutrition project, which was aimed at improving the diet of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on your Web site, "What do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?",
The representatives of the Global Citizen wrote, "This is a long and arduous way, so sometimes we'll fall and we'll get a failure.
But, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, band The Weeknd, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Jianelle Mona, is just a part of the stars that are going to play this year at the festival in New York, and they're going to weigh Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
The Minister of Internal Affairs has stated that the US can use its naval forces for the "block" to prevent the export of Russian energy.
According to a quote from the US Minister of Internal Affairs, Ryan Zinke, quoted in Washington Examiner, Washington can "for the need" seek the help of the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke stated that Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it works to invite a legitimate government, is a reason to explore new energy.
"I think they're in the Middle East, 'cause they want to be a middleman in the energy trade, as they are already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the positionary, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"The U.S. Navy can make a free pass through the seaways and, if necessary, block it so that Russian energy will not enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event, which was run by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that puts itself in the "voice of every user" in the United States.
He went on to compare the approach to trade with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they were in fact the same.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy efficiently and replace it with alternative ones," he said, calling Russia "singlely developed," as its economy is dependent on mineral energy.
While Trump’s administration has been sniffing out of these claims, Trump’s aim is to increase the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by displacing the Russian energy market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To this end, Trump’s officials and President Donald Trump themselves are trying to persuade the German government to give up the “unfulfilled” project of the North Stream 2, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the North Stream 2 gas station, costing $11 billion, will double the capacity of the existing gasgon to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusive economic project.
The Kremlin is persuasive of Washington’s strong opposition to the project for economic reasons alone, which is an example of unfair competition.
"In my view, we share the view that energy can't be a tool of pressure, and the user should be able to select the suppliers," said the Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Nowak, after meeting the U.S. Minister of Power, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position triggered a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading organization of the Federal Union of the German Industry (BDI) has called on the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and the bipartisan agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Union of the German Industry, after the last German chancellor, Angela Merkel, met with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Vorrene "will seriously think" about running for president in 2020.
Senator in Massachusetts, Elizabeth Vorrene, announced on Saturday that he would "think seriously" about running for the presidency after the inter-electoral elections.
In a meeting with the public in Goliac, Massachusetts, Vorrene confirmed that she was considering the possibility of running her candidacy.
According to The Hill Vorrene, "The time for women to go to Washington to set up the government, and for that to happen, there must be a woman in his head."
"Before November 6th, I will give serious thought to putting up my candidacy for the presidency."
In her meeting with the public, Vorrene expressed her appreciation for the presidency of Donald Trump, claiming that he "will take his country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Vorren was open, criticizing Trump and offering him a candidacy for the post of Supreme Court Judge, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a Friday Tweet, Warren wrote, "...of course, the FBI has to conduct an investigation before voting."
But according to the polls published on Friday, most of the Vorrents don't think it's supposed to go for a run in 2020.
In line with the survey conducted jointly by the Suffolk University Center for Political Research and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight per cent of the potential electors in Massachusetts state expressed their opposition to the senator's nomination.
Thirty-two percent supported the solution.
The results of the poll show that the former Governor, Deval Patrick, has been receiving more support, with 38%, against 48%, for his potential presidency.
In the course of the discussions on the candidacy of other well-known Democrats who can run in 2020, the former vice-president Joe Biden and the senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders are also called.
According to Associated Press, Biden said he'd make a decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD in a rally to support Donald Trump.
The 26-year-old Trek Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son is going through right now, what he's going through after his return, can only be understood by other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems with which our soldiers are coming home," she said in front of a meeting to support Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called Trac's arrest "a problem no one pays attention to" and said that her son and other war veterans "were going back home the way they used to be more brutal, and want to know if they respect what they've done here to take the soldiers, the pilots, and the other military officers for this country."
According to a reporter from the Wasillah Police Department, Dan Bennett, Trac was arrested on a Monday in Wasillah, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as his obstruction of the report of the incident of violence and carrying weapons in a state of drunkenness.
18 states and the state of Columbia support a claim of shelter policy
Eighteen states and the U.S. state and county support a new U.S. policy argument that the victims of banditry and domestic violence are denied refugee status.
According to NBC News, 18 state and county representatives sent an analytical note to the court's consultant in Washington to support a lender who needed shelter and complained of the policy in court.
The full name of the lender in the case of Grace v. Sachs, in response to the American Union for the Defence of Civil Rights, which denies federal policy and was filed in August, will not be solved.
The client stated that her partner "and his brutal son-in-laws" beat her, but the U.S. officials refused her when she asked for shelter on July 20.
It was illegally held in Texas.
Public prosecutors, who support Grace's suit, have said that the people of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who often ask for shelter in the United States, often face such serious problems as banditry and domestic violence.
The new policy of granting refugee status overturns the decision of the 2014 Immigration Appeals Board, according to which undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence could ask for shelter.
The Attorney General of Columbia, General Carl Reysin, stated on his Friday address that the new policy “did ignore decades of state, federal and international laws”.
“Federal law requires that the decision on the application for refugee status be based on a review of the facts and circumstances set out in such a declaration, and the ban violates this principle,” is the case in the Court's counsel's analytic note.
And then, in an analytical note, the prosecutors argue that the policy that bans immigrants from entering the United States harms the economy, as they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "make up the necessary labour resources."
Attorney General Jeff Sachs issued an order to the immigration judges in June, saying that they could no longer give refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
"The shelter is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with race, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views," said Ceshnes at the time of the 11th of June politician presentation.
The provision of shelter was never intended to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
The rescuers are desperately trying to find the survivors, while the number of dead in Pale has doubled
For those who have survived, the situation has continued to worsen.
"The situation is very stressful," says a 35-year-old mother, soothing her boy with a fever in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palau.
"Every moment, quick help brings the bodies.
There's not enough clean water."
Some people go back to their destroyed homes, and they take out the overflowing benefits in an effort to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and the hospitals that have been damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 points on Richter’s scale are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including two of Gerrys with a broken back and shoulder, are resting near the building of the Pala Army Hospital, where patients are being cared for in the open sky by constant re-stimulations.
His eyes filled with tears when he remembered how a strong push hit the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I've been pressed in the middle of a cliff of a wall," told Gerice to the Assocated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family have come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife beg for help, and then the silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador is blaming China for "recovering psychological pressure" for "advertises that contain propaganda"
A week after the Chinese national newspaper put on four pages of the American daily, advertising material on the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump of the last half-century focused on a fee-paying China Daily supplement in Des Moins Register – the most popular newspaper in Iowa, after being accused of trying to influence China's Congressional elections on November 6, China rejects the charges.
According to the Reuters official in the United States, Trump’s claims that he is blaming Beijing for trying to intervene in American elections mean a new phase of escalation on the part of Washington, whose aim is to put pressure on China.
While foreign governments can post commercials to boost trade, there is a trade war between Beijing and Washington at the time, in which they have already raised the import toll.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the initiation of a repressive tower in China was about to hit exporters from such states as Iowa, who supported the Trump Party of the Republic.
Terry Brenstead, the U.S. ambassador to China, and the former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, claimed that China had harmed American workers, farmers, and companies.
China, as Brenstead wrote in the column of the Sunday Des Moins Register, "enhances the pressure by publishing ads that contain propaganda, in our independent press."
"In order to spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American people's tradition of free speech and free press, putting up a billing advert in Des Moins Register," writes Brenstead.
"On the other hand, on the street charts here in Beijing, you can only find individual voices of dissatisfaction, and you can't see a true picture of what the Chinese people really think about the direction of the Chinese economy, which is a source of concern, which is the conclusion that China's MIs are under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the respectful Chinese editions offered to publish" his article, but he didn't name it.
Analysts warn that the failure of Cavanaugh Republicans to set up a woman-elect before an inter-electoral election
Since many prominent Republicans support and defend a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Cavanaugh, after being charged with a number of charges of sexual harassment, the analysts warn that this may cause an unwelcome reaction to future inter-elections, especially in women.
This situation is engendered by passion, and most Republicans state publicly that they would like to move on to a vote.
Such things can't be played back again," said an interview with The Hill, published on Saturday, Grant Reger, Professor of Politology at Maxwell University of Syracuse.
Rieger doubted that the FBI investigation, on which Senator Jeff Flake (respublisher from Arizona) was pressed at the last moment, would be enough to calm the angered voters.
According to Washington, D.C., the head counselor and resource person of the progressing MoveOn group (Keep moving on) Katrin Jean-Perryer declared on Friday, "The women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protesters sang "Listopad is on the way!" during a demonstration at the Juridical Committee, when the Republics decided to move on to the confirmation of Cavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr. Christine Blazey Ford's testimony.
In an interview with Stu Rotenberg's news website, an off-site political observer, he said, "People will be very interested and motivated."
"They say it is now, and it's true.
But motivation can increase, especially in the 18- to 29-year-old female voters, with pre-positions that have not yet been defined and often do not vote if they don't like the president.
Even before Ford gave a statement in connection with the indictment of a Supreme Court judge for a sexual offence, analytics predicted a negative response to the polls if the Republics insisted on a confirmation.
According to NBC News, earlier this week, the former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steele, said, "This is a bad story for the Republican Party."
In an interview with the news, the director of the United States of America's priorities (groups that help in the pre-electoral campaign for the Democrats) Guy Cecil, "it's not about the committee voting, the final vote, or how Cavanaugh got on the laure of the defendants, but how they reacted to the situation and how they acted."
But Americans' thoughts about who they believe, Ford or Cavanaugh, have been divided, and Ford has a little more support.
According to a new YouTube poll, 41% of the respondents believe or are more likely to believe in Ford's testimony, while Cavanaugh's testimony either trusts or is more likely to believe 35% of the respondents.
In addition, 38 percent of the interviewees said that they thought Cavanaugh was giving or was more likely giving false testimony, while 30 percent of the interviewees said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after his insistence, the FBI is running a background check on the Ford charges and another levy, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Juridical Committee about how Cavanaugh attacked her while in a state of drunkenness when she was 17.
Ramírez stated that the candidate for the position of a Supreme Court judge showed her his genitals at a party at the University of Jelena in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global Internet is planning to run a "new Internet" to create a Google and Facebook rivalry.
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the global Internet, is launching a new startup to create a competition for Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The last project of the world's legend of technology, the Inrupt company, is developing a platform with an open source Solid, an idea that belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users can choose where to save the data and who to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the Inrupt target was "world rule."
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
This is a historical moment."
The application uses the Solid technology, which will enable users to create a "personal online data repository" or a POD.
It can store contact lists, list of current files, calendar, audio library, and other tools for its own use and operation.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify at the same time.
The unique feature of this personal online data stash is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "the expansion of personal capabilities by means of data."
According to Inrupt Director-General John Bruce, the company has the aim of putting in place resources, processes, and appropriate skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
So far, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the IBM security platform, a number of regular developers hired to work on the project, and a network of volunteer-programmers.
Beginning this week, technologists around the world can make their own offline applications, using tools available on the Inrupt Web site.
Berners-Lee claimed that he and his team don't negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether to make a full replacement when all their business models are undergoing fundamental changes in a short period of time.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Media Burners-Lee, the Inrupt company's mission was to "provide commercial energy and eco-systems and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by setting up the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last months, Berners-Lee is an influential figure in the debate about online neutrality.
Even at the start of the Inrupt Berners-Lee, he was the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, The Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I look very optimistly at the next era of network development," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vanne: Commemoration of the Church of the Order of Victoria during World War I
The only representative of the Anglican Church who received the Order of the Church of Victoria for taking part in the war during World War I is being honored in his hometown after 100 years.
Lt. Colonel Bernard Vann was rewarded for participating in the Belnglis and Leokurs attack on September 29, 1918.
But he was killed by a sniper's bullet four days later, and he never found out he had the highest military reward in Britain.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren discovered a memorial stone during a parade in the city of Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vanne, called it "uniquely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place just 100 years after his grandpa made a feat for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Colonel Vanne translated his batalion via the St. Katen Channel "by a very dense mist and by a dense fire of field guns and machine-guns."
Later, he hastened to the fire border, and with "sudden bravery" led the line forward, before one broke into the field cannon, and destroyed three fires of an enemy sub-unit.
Lt. Colonel Vanna was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – a little more than a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vanne said that his grandpa had done something he himself would never have been able to do again and that he deserved to be respected.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vanne, put a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vanne said that "he's going to feel very proud of taking part in this parade" and he added that "the courage of a true hero is shown by the respect that so many people show him."
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they were shown "Pig Peppa."
Imagine you don't sleep all night just to watch the Bellator 206, and you're not allowed to view the main event.
There were 13 battles in the post office in San José, including six main program titles, which were aired live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just before Gegard Moussa and Rory McDonald were getting ready to join up in a fight, the United Kingdom TV starved to the point that Peppa's guinea pig appeared on the screen.
Some of the viewers were not thrilled, as they had not been sleeping until the very morning, waiting for a fight.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that the switching to a child's cartoon seemed to him "some kind of bad joke."
"According to the Government's order of content, which was aired at 6:00 a.m., was inconsistent, so they had to give up a child's show," said Dave Schwartz, the senior vice-president of marketing and public relations to Bellator, when he was asked for a TV show,
Peppa Pig, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, has promised to work on the airing chart to cover the audiences in Britain in the future.
"I think that if we talk about reruns, we can do it," said Coker.
"But it's Sunday, 6:00 in the morning, and we can't do anything until we have Sunday, and it's Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the radio was shut off, we got a lot of messages we were responding to, and the text of those messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical failure, and we tried to fix it.
However, it was found to be an incompatibility with government orders.
I can promise you that this will not happen again.
We're going to shorten the tower to five instead of six, as usual, and we've been trying to redirect the signal to fans, but we've been putting it off so far.
It's a really bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation
Tom Daley, an olympian water skirmish, tells us that he was growing up, feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't know "not everyone like him" until he went to high school.
Taking part in the Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he pointed out that he had been outright talking about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also claimed that his parenthood had made him less worried about winning the Olympic Games.
A longtime host, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for a few months.
After arriving as a pariah at Laverne's first program, Daley claimed to have felt worse than the others in his childhood, because "the community didn't think it was like a boy or a girl."
He said, "To this time, the sense of less cost and difference was exactly what gave me the strength and the strength to succeed."
According to him, he wanted to prove something "back," so he wouldn't disappoint everyone who finally found out about his orientation.
The two-fold bronze Olympic Priest became a well-known LBHT-rights player and used this year's Commonwealth Games to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was talking outright about his views, because he was happy to live in an open life without any result, and he wanted to give this "hope" to others.
A three-time world champion admitted that his feelings for the man, American filmmaker Dustin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013 were a real surprise to him.
Dalei got to the Oscar award winner, the 20-year-old, last year, but, according to him, the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" (in the first Olympics he played at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would also survive the same fall and fall.
In June, there was a son called Robert Ray Black-Daly, and from that time on, according to Dale, his "world-wide perception" has changed.
"When you asked me last year, I'd only think about what to get gold," he said.
"You know, there are things much more important than the Olympic Gold Medals.
My Olympic gold is Robby."
His son was named his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dalei said that his father couldn't accept the idea of the end, and before he died, he asked if they had bought the tickets to the London Olympics 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't say to him, "you're not gonna be in the front row, 'because you're not gonna be around anymore," said Dale.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daly took part in the 2012 Olympics and acquired bronze.
"I knew this was what I'd been dreaming about my whole life: diving in front of my countrymen at the Olympics, and there was no better feeling than that," said Dale.
It also inspired him to select his first song, the Proud, in the performance of Heather Small, which resonated with him during the preparation for the Olympics and still calls ants.
Desert Island Discs is released at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 p.m. in English.
On Saturday from the game of the touring game for the Ryder Cup, Michaelson was out of shape.
American Phil Miquellson set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game in the tournament for "The Ryder Cup," but it has to re-enter the form so that this event will not be miserable for him.
Michaelson, who is a record 12th member of a bi-year-long tour, pulled captain Jim Furyk out of the game for the time of the forbes and forts.
Instead of being at the center of the event, as he often did, playing for the United States, the five-time winner has been cheering the team up all day and training on the side, hoping to master his emotions.
Since Michaelson was not well-known for punching even while in the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete was not exactly fit for a complex golf course, Le Golf National, where a raft usually punishes for wandering punches.
And if it's not that hard, on Sunday's 9th match, Michaelson will have to meet the Open Champion and the Master of the exact hit by Francesco Molinari, who, together with the new Tommy Fleetwood, won all his match this week.
If Americans who are behind three points after 12 singles start well, the Michaelson game can be decisive.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his sportsman, and he probably had nothing to add to it.
"He fully understood his role today, shuddered me on the back, hugged me, and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furik.
"He has no doubt about his powers.
Michaelson is a member of the Hall of Fame, who has done so much for the teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I've been predicting more matches, but that's how it worked, so we've decided to do it.
He wants to be there in the field, like everyone else."
If Michaelson goes to the field on Saturday, Nick Faldo's record will be shattered, who played the highest number of games in the Cup of Ryder.
He may be able to complete his career in the "Ryder Cup" tour, which has never been in line with his individual accomplishments.
On Michaelson's account, 18 wins, 20 defeats, and 7 no results, but Furyk said that his presence could play a critical role for the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's a guy, he's a guy who's cool to have a mom in a team," Furik.
"I think the younger players had a good time riding on it, as well as this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He's more than just a player."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the big break doesn't solve anything.
Thomas Bjorn, a captain of the European team, has learned from experience that the sensational evok of the single match of the last day of the Tournaire for the Ryder Cup has yet to guarantee a win.
Denmark debuted in 1997 in a game on the field of the Walderram Club, where the team led with Sev Ballesteros ahead of the Americans by five points, but won a match with a small break with a result of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big break in a game at the Walderram field; a big break at the Brookline where we lost, and at the Walderram field, where we've been forced to win," said Bjorn after watching Class 2018 wins, with a result of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National Stadium, after which the break is 10:6.
So history teaches me and every player in the team that nothing has yet been resolved.
We have to play with the best we can tomorrow.
Go out to the field and do whatever you need to do.
The game will not be finished until the result is on the table.
We have the goal of getting this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said earlier, I'm focused on 12 of our team, but we are well aware of who will stand up to us, the best player in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in the hard field, Bjorn added, "I will never run ahead.
Tomorrow things can all be different.
We're gonna have a separate match tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's cool to play field with a partner when things go well, but just when you're standing there alone, and you can check out what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how you're going to set up the player's performance tomorrow: at the limit of opportunity.
You leave your partner with no support, and now he has to show us what he can do."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposite number, Jim Furick, expects his partners to play a better game at the individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Up to Furik's last day, the fate was back by different sides: he was among the winners in Brookline, but he was defeated when a team from Europe created "The Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, organized the players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 major match-ups tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, like it was in Brookline and Medina.
When the initiation is on a side, the players in the middle of the distance are under particular pressure.
We've properly positioned the players in the team, as if we're going to do, like, something incredible tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to take the lead in a top-mast attack against Rory McElroy, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Polter are on the top half of the list.
"It's these partners, and in this order, I've chosen because I want to share the effort in an even-handed way throughout the game," so Bjorn commented on his choice of individual game players.
The introduction of a new German warship was re-entered
The most recent frigate of the German navy was to be put in place as early as 2014 instead of the old warships of the Cold War, but, according to the local media, this will not happen at least the next year, due to the failure of the systems and the upsurge in cost.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, from a spokesman for the military, the entry into operation of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the main ship of a series of modern frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the shipment affected the implementation of the ambit project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old Bremen class frigate.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some of the technologies for lowering visibility, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic.
Another important feature is a long period of technical security, and it is expected that new frigates will be able to stay off the base port for about two years.
Journalists Die Zeit warns, however, that due to the constant delay, the warships that were to increase Germany’s military power in the sea will also become obsolete at the time of their introduction.
The multi-family frigate F125 was hit in the headlines of the Toric newspaper, when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into action and returned it to the Blohm + Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a warship was returned to a ship-building company after delivery.
The reasons for the return are not known, but the German media referred to the significant “software and hardware deficient” that made the warship unfit for military operations.
Shortcomings of the software are of particular importance, as the ship of the Baden-Württemberg class is made up of about 120 seafarers – just half the number of soldiers who served in the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it has been found that the vessel has a significant excess of weight, which has a negative effect on its exploitative properties and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
The Rhineland-Palatinate frigate is believed to be twice as heavy (7000 tons) for the same class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the mismatch of equipment, another problem has been the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of preparing the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euro has been converted to a massive 3.1 billion euro (US$ 3.6 billion).
Problems with getting new frigates have gained a special weight in the light of recent warnings about the fall of the German navy.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, a man of the Armed Forces Bundestag, reported that the navy of the country “was left with a small number of ships fit for combat missions”.
The official stated that the situation had deteriorated for a period of time, as the old ships had been out of use and the new ones had not arrived.
He expressed deep regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had been able to complete the navy.
A national trust will watch the hidden life of bats
A new study on land use in Scotland is intended to determine how bats use the landscape to search for food.
Scientists hope that the data can shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to take future steps to save them.
In the Invery Gardens in Wester Ross, a Schottland National Trust scientist will be watching such species as neopier dwarfs and pygmies, as well as ears of common and watery night.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations in the land area to observe the behavior of the bats during the season.
Workers and volunteers from the Scotland National Trust will also conduct mobile research using hand-detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to establish the frequency and fitness of bats.
And then we plan to develop a complete map of the animal's life and to prepare a report to link the animal's behavior to the environment.
Rob Deward, a resource person for the protection of the natural environment in Scotland’s National Lost, hopes that the results of the study will help to determine which areas are the most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of actions to care for the environment (e.g. the formation of grasslands) and to determine how best to conserve the forest for bats and other associated species.
Over the last century, bat populations have fallen significantly in Scotland and Britain.
They are threatened by the active construction and development of areas that rob them of their place of worship.
Other negative factors include wind rigs and light, adhesive fly paper, chemical processing of building material, and attacking home cats.
The vocabularies are not in fact blind.
But by hunting at night, their ears are more effective in catching prey than their eyes.
They use a complex sonar method to detect insects and hindrances on the trajectory of the flight.
In Scotland’s national cost of over 270 historical buildings, 38 orchards of special importance, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, bats are taken very seriously.
Ten specially trained experts conduct regular research, check -ups, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's strengths even created the first and only Fleet Reservoir in Scotland, which is located in the area of Trev in the area of Dumfriss & Halloway, where eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland are found.
David Thompson, the manager, says it's an ideal place for them.
"In the area of the Premises, there are excellent conditions for bats," he assures us.
"There are old buildings, a lot of big trees, and other favorable living conditions.
But we still need to learn a lot about bats, and with the research we do here and elsewhere, we can learn more about what they need to flourish."
It insists that it is very important to test the area for bats before any technical work is done, as the unwitting destruction of one nest to produce a young man can kill up to 400 females with children, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
Scatterers and their nests are protected by the law, and animals are not allowed to kill, torturing or torturing.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Fleet Conservation Center, called on the public to join the organization.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats.
Ronaldo rejects the charge of rape, and his lawyers are preparing a complaint against the German edition.
Cristian Ronald called the charges of rape a "fucking-up" and said that people were "thinking to draw attention to themselves" using his name.
His attorneys are ready to file a complaint against the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, in which information about the suspicions was published.
Katrin Majorga, an American woman, accused Portugal's national forward and the Juventus football club of raping in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel on Friday, he was supposed to pay $375,000 to keep quiet.
A few hours after the 33-year-old Ronald was charged, he turned to 142 million of his fans in an Instagram video transmission, calling the respective messages a "smart."
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are slandered," a statement was made on the camera by the Golden Ball's five-time ruler.
"They want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to profit from me, but this kind of thing is part of my job.
I'm a happy man and I'm okay," added a football player, smiling.
According to the Reuters news agency, Ronald's attorneys are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the published charges, which they called "unacceptable report of suspicion in private life."
The lawyer, Christian Shertz, claimed that a footballer would require compensation for "moral damage in size, which is consistent with the seriousness of a violation, which is likely to be one of the most common cases of individual rights violations in recent years."
The incident was said to have taken place in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at the nightclub, Ronald and Majorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her.
Majorga states that after the incident, he fell on his knees and said he was a 99% good guy, who was a "one percent" bad guy.
As stated in the records, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with a model, but in agreement with each other.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police, and then to the hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to a court order, because she was "afraid of avenging" and was wary of "public humiliation."
Now, a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel her previous deal, because she's still suffering from an incident she says has.
At the time of the incident, he was preparing to go to the FC Real Madrid with Manchester United, and this summer he became a player in the Grand Italian football, the Juventus team, for 100 million euro.
Brexit: Britain will be "long-lasting" about the loss of automotive workers
Britain will be "long-lastingly harmed" if it loses the status of world leader in the automobile industry after Brexit, a warning from the Minister of the Economy, Greg Clark.
He added that he was overwhelmed by a statement by Toyota UK, who told BBC reporters that, in the event of British exit from the EU without a deal, the company would have to suspend the production and work of its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," says Minister Clarke.
The Japanese automotive worker stated that the effect of the delay on the border in the event of Brexit without a deal could cost a job.
The Bernaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis cars, has released about 150,000 cars, 90% of which have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my view, if Britain is to leave the EU exclusivly at the end of March, production in our plant will be halted," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other automotive workers, such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain’s exit from the EU will affect without an international trade deal.
For example, BMW stated that the Mini model company in Oxford would be shut down a month after Brexit.
The main fear of automotive manufacturers is that Brexit, without a deal, can cause risk to supply chains.
Toyota's production line functions in a fast-delivery mode of parts and materials according to needs – details come every 37 minutes from the British and EU suppliers to be driven.
If, on March 29, Britain would leave the EU without a deal, there might be a breakdown in the supply of the details, which would result in delays and a lack of material.
As the company says, the Toyota warehouse can place the details for no more than one day, so the production will have to stop.
Greg Clark stated that the organization's plan for a relationship with the EU, prepared by Theresa May (Checkers Plan), “is a very well-defined way of avoiding problems on the border.
"We need a deal, and we need to make an optimist deal, which I think will not only be able to succeed at the moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have emerged," he said during the Today program at BBC Radio 4.
"Bearing in mind the testimony of Toyota's representatives, as well as of other automotive workers, we need to keep the well-formed high-performing supply chains."
The Toyota company has not been able to tell us how long the production will be halted, but in a long-term perspective, it is expected that an increase in the cost will reduce the company's competitiveness and, as a result, cause the job to be shortened.
Peter Tsovalaris, head of the United Trade Union in Bernaston Factory, who worked here for 24 years, said that the other participants were very concerned, "I can tell from experience that shortened jobs do not resume."
A government representative said, "We have put forward a precise and solid plan to shape our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting can be postponed again, in the White House
According to White House officials on Sunday, the responsible meeting of Donald Trump with the Assistant Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein may be "relay for a week" while the debate is on Brett Cavanaugh's candidacy as a judge of the Supreme Court.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Müller, who investigates Russia's intervention in the election, the links between Trump and Russia's assistants, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
For a few months in Washington, D.C., we have been discussing the possibility of the release of the attorney-general, which would put Mueller's independence at risk.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about the use of microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of the 25th Amendment ending the President's powers.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday, he visited the White House on the background of reports that an official was about to retire.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump claimed that "wouldn't want" to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was set aside to avoid a match over time with the Senate Juridical Committee, where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of being sexually harassed, Dr. Christina Blazey Ford, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh, which added to the senatorial vote.
Trump's prime minister, Sarah Sanders, played on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date of the meeting is not set, it may be this week, and I expect it to be set aside for another week, in view of all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But let's see, I keep watching the press have the last information."
Some reporters disagreed: Sanders didn't run a writ for the media in the White House since September 10.
The headman, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders replied that the infrequent conduct of the Brifings was not related to the "playing for the public" by TV reporters, even though she said, "I don't want to deny that they're playing for the public."
She then assumed that Trump himself would be more involved with the press.
"The president answers the questions more often than any president to him," she said, and she added, without referring to the source, "Statistics speaks for itself."
Sanders pointed out that the breetings are still going to take place, but "if the press has an opportunity to ask the President of the United States a question, it's better than talking to me."
We're trying to talk to the press a lot, it's supposed to be particularly noticeable over the last few weeks, and the ability to talk to the U.S. President is no worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly responds to questions from outside the White House, open shops, or press conferences for the participation of high-level guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why this is so, in the face of the reporters in a way that is sorely and at times bizarre.
The State Secretary for Health in Scotland has sent a letter to EU employees for fear of Brexit.
The State Secretary for Health has sent a letter to citizens of other EU countries who work for the National Health Service in Scotland to express their appreciation for their work and to ask for it to be continued after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish government has already assumed the obligation to defray the cost of an application for permanent resettlement status for EU citizens who work in the autonomous state services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman said, "For the last summer, we've been talking between Britain and the EU about the way out, and we've got to wait for the right decisions.
But the British government is intensifying preparations for a possible exit without a treaty.
I know this period can be very worrisome for you.
That's why I'd like to stress again how much I value the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Collaborates from all over the European Union and beyond share valuable experience and skills, building up and improving health services for the benefit of the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, we really want you to stay."
Christion Ebercrombie transient post head trauma
The semi-backer of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Ebercrombie, overwhelmed a terminal operation after getting a head injury in a Sunday match against the Vanderbilt Comodores, which his team played with a 31:27 account. This was reported by a reporter in Tennessee.
The main trainer of Tennessee State Tigers told reporters that the player was injured just before the break.
"He went to the sideline where he got mad," he said.
On the sideline, the coaches and the medical staff gave Ebercrombie the oxygen before taking it back on their shoulders for a follow - up examination.
An official of the Tennessee State Tigers team told Chris Harris from WSMV (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercrombie was operating at the University of Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "until there's any evidence of the type and severity of the injury." In the Tennessee State Tigers team, they're trying to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a second-year student, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after moving from the Illinois team.
He did five pickups of a ball on Sunday before he got out of the game, so he's got 18 pickups in the season.
Foreign buyers will pay more tomatoes in the event of the United Kingdom’s immobility
Foreign buyers will pay more tomatoes in the event of the British turbulence. In line with Tory's new plans, extra money will be spent to help the homeless.
This set neutralizes all Corbin's attempts to involve young voters
The higher state toll will be drawn from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
In the Department of Finance, an extra £120 million a year is expected to be used to help the homeless.
As Teresa May, a foreigner who buys non-moving in Britain today, will pay more tomatoes, and extra money will be spent to help the homeless.
This step can be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremiah Corbin’s efforts to involve young voters in promises of more affordable housing for highly paid workers.
An increase in the amount of money is due to natural and legal persons who don't pay taxes in Britain, and the government has to help those who have to spend the night in the open sky.
An additional token, which is accompanied by an upswing of the two - year - olds to a second dwelling and a permanent lease, can be three percent.
In the Department of Finance, an additional £120 million a year is expected.
In London, 13% of the new immobility is estimated to be in the possession of foreign citizens, which increases prices and makes it more difficult for people who just want to live in their own life.
Many rich parts of the country, especially in the capital, are deserted, as a large number of foreign buyers live most of the time outside the country.
The new plan of action came in just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a lowering of the state toll to make it more accessible to young people.
He blamed the big building companies for supporting the high price of immobility by buying land without further use of it, and he called on Theresa May to give up the quota for available immobility to fix the "smart position on the housing market" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin has announced a number of important reforms in the realm of non-moving, such as the control of rents and the impossibility of evading without good reason.
He also proposes to expand the authority of the local council in the area of new housing.
Theresa May said, "Torique, I promised to dedicate my priority to the restoration of the British dream -- for every new generation of life, it has to be a better one.
This requires a change in our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always remain open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
But it is not fair to say that individuals who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, buy housing on the same terms as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own dwelling has become unattainable, and the problem of living in the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "More than anything, I want to be the head coach in Scotland."
Chief Coach of the FC Sanderland, Jack Ross, claims that "most of all he wants" to take over Scotland's collection.
A 42-year-old Scotsman went to reinstate the club from the north-east of the country, which is now ranked third in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to Stadium of Light this summer, returning last season to the St.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to Scotland's second collection, but it's all over," Ross told me on the Sportsout program at BBC Scottland radio station.
"When I was a kid, my dad and I used to watch the game in Scotland at Hampden Park Stadium.
The only hope for me is to be successful as the club's head coach."
Ross' predecessors to the FC "Sanderland" include Dick the Attorney, David Moyes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy King, Gustavo Poetus, and Paolo DiCanio.
FC's former Chief Coach "Hello Athletique" claims he didn't feel agitated about moving to a big club following such prominent names, pre-empting the offers from the FC "Barnsley" and "Ipwich Town."
"In the current phase, I'll think I've been successful if the club goes back to the Premier League.
Thanks to its structure and material and technical security, this club is no doubt in line with the level of the Premier League,” he said.
"It's not gonna be an easy task, but the other result I don't think is going to be a success."
Ross has been a trainer for just three years, and he's been a second coach at the FC Dumbarton, and he's spent 15 months at the FC Training Staff of the Garths.
And then he helped "Hello" out after the FC got to the third division, and the next season, from "St.
According to Ross, he's now more comfortable than ever during his FC game career at "Clyde", "Gartlpool", "Folkerk", "St. Murren" and "Hamilton Academy."
"I'm at a crossroads," he mentions, talking about moving to the FC "Hello."
"I sincerely believed that the coaching was more appropriate to me than the game.
That sounds strange, because I've been a success, I've been a good earner, and I've reached some heights.
But it's not easy to play.
There are a lot of problems that we have to cope with every week.
I still face them with stress and stress, but as a head coach, I feel at my place.
I've always been interested in coaching, and I've never felt more comfortable in my adult life than I've ever felt since I chose this profession."
You'll be able to listen to the full interview on Sunday, September 30, at the radio station Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 in British summer time.
Study: 5:30 a.m. Sunday is the perfect time for a beer kitchen.
The summer heat has helped to increase the value of British pubs, which are not in the best of times, but have increased the pressure on the network of restaurants.
In July, sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7 per cent, while the profit of restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of CGA, a business advisory organization, said, "Because of the solar weather and longer than expected, England's participation in the World Cup, July went over the same pattern as the previous month, when the profit rose by 2.8 per cent, and the restaurants went even worse.
The rotting fall by 1.8% in July has increased.
Pubs and bars focused on drinking so far have the best scores – the increase in their profits is the same as the loss of restaurants.
Pubs serving food have also been affected by the heat, but not as much as restaurants do.
Visitors seem to be just interested in a drink.
In controlled pubs and bars, the month-to-month supply of drinks has increased by 6.6%, while food sales have fallen by 3%.
Paul Newman, analyst at the Free and Hotel Department of RSM, said, "Such a trend we've been seeing since the end of April.
Weather and massive social or sporting events continue to be the main factors affecting sales on the domestic market.
Not surprisingly, groups of restaurants continue to lose their profits. An annual 4.8 per cent drop in sales is a particular source of concern in the background of the need to shorten the cost.
A long hot summer didn't come at the best time for the catering facilities, so let's see if the milder temperature we've been watching in August can give them the necessary refreshment.
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, in July was 2.7 per cent, which reflects a slowing down in the market for new brands.
The galouse index of the volume of sales of the Computer Peach Tracker in the British pubs, bars, and restaurants is a reflection of the collected and analysed performance of 47 working groups with a total trade volume of over £9 billion.
Every five kids have an account hidden from their parents on the social network.
According to the results of the study, one in five children, sometimes under 11 years of age, has an account hidden from their parents and teachers on social media.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of fictional pages in Instagram
This news has increased the concern about possible sexual content
20 per cent of the students reported having a "primary account" that is shown to their parents.
Every five kids, sometimes not over 11 years of age, writes a social media account that hides them from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of fictitious pages in Instagram, a social network for the exchange of photographs.
This news has increased the concern about the possible placement of a sexual content.
20 per cent of the students reported having a clean "primary" account to be shown to their parents, as well as one or more private ones.
Mother, who accidentally stumbled on the covert page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw a call for "rape me."
A study by Digital Avenues UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools revealed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two social media profiles. Half of these children have admitted that an additional account is secret.
The head of the HMC Association, Mike Buchanan, said, "We are very concerned about the fact that a lot of teenagers feel the need to create an online space where parents and teachers will not be able to find it."
Elide Doyle will become a "representative of the interests of the athletes" in the Scotty Athletics
Elide Doyle has been selected to the Scotty Athletics Council as an independent director during the annual general board of board members.
Doyle is a steward of Scotland, and the head of the board, Yen Beatty, called this a great opportunity for those who lead the sporting movement to take advantage of the wide-ranging experience gained at the international level over the last decade.
"Eylid enjoys a lot of respect among Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that, by joining the council, the athletic sport in Scotland will be of great benefit," Beatty's assurance.
Doyle said, "Inspired to be a member of the interests of the athletes, I hope to be able to make a difference and to promote sports in Scotland."
The American, a four-time Olympic champion who won 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta game, and now a BBC sports tourner, lost the opportunity to go through a transitory ischemic attack.
He wrote to Twitter, "That's when I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I could get back and how much.
I have been able to get back to full, and I have been able to walk again, and I am doing a dynamic exercise today!
Thank you for the words of support!"
In advertising, the milk-sucker of women was compared to the cows – the Internet users' thoughts split up.
The milk-sucker has been confronted with a mixed response from Internet users to an ad that compares young mothers to active cows.
To mark the release of a product called "the world's first quiet breast-sucker," Elvie's tech company produced an ad in a humorist music video to show the freedom that a new sucker can provide.
Four real moms dance in a blue-filled cinnamon under a song that says, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have a tail," and, "As you see, it's not a spell, it's my breasts."
And the choir goes, "Suck it, suck it up to feed the kids, suck it, suck it up so you don't lose the milk."
However, a commercial on a Facebook company page has led to a turbulent discussion online.
Videos have produced 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the response of the Internet users has been mixed, and many have noted that the advertising has underestimated the “horrible organization” of the milk industry.
"It's not a very smart decision to use cows to sell this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and have a baby to give their milk, but their kids get sucked out of them a few days after they're born," wrote one of the users.
Elvie's milk-sucker can easily be hidden in a breast-feeding bench (Elvie/Moother)
Here's another comment: "It's obvious it's traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why don't you bring them in to sell a breast-sucker for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone added, "These ads are far from real."
Other users have taken part in the defense of the commercial, and one of the women's videos was "so much fun."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would certainly have bought something like that if I still breastfed.
Sucking my milk, I really felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I didn't look for hidden content in it.
It's a wonderful product," wrote someone.
Here's another comment: "Cool ads for moms who suck up milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This ad is not about highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women display breast-suckers hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use such products feel like cows.
But Elvie's suction is very quiet, has no wires or tubes, and is easy to hide in a breast-feeding bra, so that women can move freely, keep their kids, and even go out.
Ana Balareen, a partner and executive director of the Mather Advertiser, commented on this situation, "The Elvie Sucker is so revolutionary that it requires a bright and provocative presentation.
After finding a parallel between women who cure milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the features of breast-feeding, in an exciting and curious way, to show the incredible sense of freedom that a new sucker would bring.
Elvie sucker is not the first time in the news headers.
Within the week of fashion, in London, the mother of two children appeared on a session with this product during the presentation of the dress from the fashion modeler, Martha Yakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent town on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively constant, in part because the strictness of the Trump administration has made the placement of children in caretakers more difficult.
Traditionally, most of the caregivers have been the immigrants themselves who do not have the documents, and now they are afraid to put their own opportunity to stay in the country at risk, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk went up in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential caretakers and other adult members of their homes would be required to print their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albins, a senior member of the Bureau of Immigration and Control, testified to Congress that the Bureau's co-workers had arrested dozens of people who applied to care for adolescence without escort.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
"Around 80 per cent of the people who are caretakers or members of their homes are illegal in the country, many of whom are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we're still persecuting these people," Mr. Albins remarked.
According to the staff of the shelter, in order to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials have put in place new rules that will require some of the children to appear in court within a month of being held, not 60 days from now.
Many of them will be able to use a video conference, not to come to court in person, to prove their legal status before the immigration judges.
Those who do not have the right to receive shelter by a court decision will be deported quickly.
According to the staff of the shelter and the official data from the responsible officials in the last months, the longer the children are on the watch, the more likely it is that they will be alarmed or depressed, and this can cause outbreaks of violence or escape.
The legal defenders say that these problems are growing in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological state of the children.
They added that by moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to get ready emotionally or to say good-bye to their friends, we risk exacerbating the trauma that many of them have suffered.
Syria ordered the United States, France, and Turkey to immediately pull out the troops.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, even though the country has been in war for eight years.
Moualem, who also works as a deputy prime minister, claimed that the foreign forces had been on Syrian land illegally under the influence of the fight against terrorism, so “the attitude towards them will be appropriate”.
"They have to go now and not make a deal," he said at the assembly.
Mu'alem insisted that "war on terror is in fact over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He claimed that Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territory" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has set up some 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mostly teaching and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
In a war-torn country, France sent over 1,000 soldiers.
With regard to the refugees, Mu'alem assured us that the country created the right conditions for their return, and he also accused "some Western countries" of "proliferating unsubstantiated fears" for which the refugees do not dare to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help people return," he said.
"We're watching an attempt to politicize a very humanitarian problem."
The US and the European Union warn that they will not help Syria to rebuild the country until a political agreement has been made between Assad and the war-stopping opposition.
The United Nations Diplomats will report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around Idlibu, the last major rebel cover, has created the opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a massive attack by the Syrian forces backed by Russia on a province of three million people.
But Mu'alem stressed that the deal has “smart terms” and expressed the hope that the military action would be directed against the jihadists, including the Al-Qaida-linked al-Nusr Front, who would be “destroyed. ”
UN Embassador Staffan de Mistura is looking forward to the first session of the new committee, which will include government representatives and opposition, in order to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and to create conditions for the holding of elections.
Mu'alem put in place the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that his work should be restricted to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and cautioned against intervention.
Why Trump will be reconfigured
According to this logic, Trump can be reconfigured in 2020, if, as a lot of liberal viewers are likely to expect, it does not make up the authority in the wake of the scandal and impeachment.
No doubt it would have been "the most far-fetched end of the presidency in all time!"
At the moment, viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on CNN and has in fact tripled (up to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, in Fox News, an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the Rachel Madow Show program on the MSNBC cable channel was at the top of the 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the main news was being discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people, because it's beyond our comprehension," said Neil Bere, the producer of the last-candidacy drama on the ABC channel, about the Secretary of State, who becomes president after the fatal attack on the Capitol.

For me, for instance, Super Mario will never be the former.
"The sense of realism in the show is in part related to the fact that you are consummated every night with something new," remarked Brent Montgomery, Chief Executive Officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the author of a TV program called "The Stars of the Pawnshop", about rotating in an action unit, and the daily plotting of the show "Trump" (a conflict with the NFL, supported by Kim Chen In).
If you let yourself miss one episode, you can be hopelessly left behind.
When I met Mr. Flace this week at his house on the north coast of Kauai Island, there was a warm sun (27 degrees Celsius), but he was at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get rid of the TV, not when Brett Cavanaugh put himself in front of the Senate Juridical Committee, and the Supreme Court's future was hanging out.
"Remember how we used to make all those crazy shows, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flace told me.
"I saw it as a joke, but it looks like they were right."

External Infusions of the Hardest Intermediate Choices at Congress
Not surprisingly, in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, there are extra infusions of money, as two of the right congressmen run for one chair.
In the struggle for this parish of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed, a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lemb, has won a victory in another district in an additional election last spring.
Lemb is opposed to another valid congressman, the Republican of China Roths, who now represents the 12th state of Pennsylvania, the 12th district of which is much the same as the new 17th.
The charts were reworked after the Pennsilvania Supreme Court in January passed a decision that the old boundaries of the districts were set for the benefit of the Republicans, despite the constitution.
The pre-electoral race in the new 17th district has led to strong opposition between the financial subdivisions of the main parties, the United States Democratic Party Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NCRCC).
The name Lemba became very well-known in Pennsylvania after a win with a minimal advantage in the 18th Circuit, during an additional election to the Congress in March, which was widely publicized.
This place belonged to the Republic for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won a 20-point win in this area.
Political experts have given little priority to the Democrats.
In the United States, the possibility of reprimanding El Salvador for the support of China was considered, but changed its mind
Diplomats reminded us of Washington’s weak opposition to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which had backed Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump had a warm meeting with President Panami, Juan Carlos Varela, and earlier Trump had a hotel in Panama, until his partners removed the staff hired by Trump Organization.
Officials of the State Department have decided to withdraw the heads of the United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama on the basis of “the recent decision on non-removal of Taiwan,” the press secretary of the Department, Gezer Neuert, said earlier this month.
But it was only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid in 2017, in particular in the field of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which included a shortening of financial aid and a target limit on the issuance of a visa, would be painful for this country of Central America, with its high levels of unemployment and murder.
According to the results of the internal council of the North and Central American states, the conference was held at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity, and last year's analytic West was viewed as a step forward in the efforts to control the flow of migrants in the United States.
But by the middle of September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and in fact, the question of the sanctions against El Salvador was no longer taken up.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pence is now planning to address a conference scheduled for mid-October to show that the administration considers this to be a very important event.
At that time, three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, for there were no new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton’s representative at the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions that had been reported by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, on anonymous terms.
The information they provided was corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on anonymous terms.

The next discontent is a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Müller on the possible obstruction of Trump's justice, which is a strong confirmation of what can be found in the public information now available.
As part of his investigation, Mueller is said to be testing a possible link between Trump's campaign and an attack on our voting system from Russia.
If Congress’s influence changes, Trump will have to report to Congressmen, just as he would to the polls and eventually to the same party.
There's a lot of "if" in this case, and I don't want to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as are his colleagues in Europe.

The course of history is defined by such moments, and the unbridled movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing a number of such moments.
What are we gonna do if Trump fires A.D.A. Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mr. Mueller's fate depends?
Rosenstein was in a mess when the news in the paper was that he was talking to the president in secret and he was talking about Trump's incompatibility with the position.
Rosenstein called the news in The Times an imprecise one.
"How will we react if the investigation of Brett Cavanaugh, who recently started the FBI, is not sufficiently thorough or fair enough, or if Cavanaugh's candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed, despite strong accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And, first of all, will we, in the medium term, vote for those members of Congress who can bring Trump to account?
If we fail this test, there will be bad times for democracy.

As a result of the injury, the semi-entrepreneur Graham Dorrans was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in a match with the Villarreal, which ended with a 2-2 count, but he believes that the FC Rangers can use it as a swing to do more.
"For us, this was a good result, because "Vilarreal" is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out to play with the hope of getting something and got one point.
Maybe at the end of the game we could go ahead, but nothing in general can probably be considered a fair result.
In the first half, the opponent was a better one, but after the break, we remedied the situation for our benefit.
On Thursday, there will be another important opposition in the League of Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it won't be easy, and our future rivals have shown a good result in their last game, but we can count on the support of the batterers, and I'm sure we can get a good result.
Last year was, of course, hard, starting with my injuries and ending up with the changes in the club itself, but now the situation is normal.
We have a great setup, and all the boys are content.
I hope we can move on, leave behind last season, and make it a success."
Women Desperate From the Fear of Retirement
Despite the fact that the interviewers had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of themselves, few spoke to their family about it.
About half of the people who took part in the Nationalwide study said that they spoke to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of the interviewees talked to the kids about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't have to start talking about it," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of Nationwide's Life Insurance Division.
That's where we start.
Talk to your husband or wife and your children: Your family will not be able to provide you with the care you need if you do not inform your family of your wishes in advance.
Ask your counselor and your family to find out where and how to get care, as this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call on a financial consultant: he can suggest how to cover the cost.
The sources of long - term care financing include the traditional insurance policy, the hybrid life insurance policy, or the self-sustainable self-sustainability (as long as you have money).
Carefully prepare legal documents: This will help to avoid legal tracts in advance.
Prepare trust for your representative, who will control your health care and make sure that experts do what you want if you are not able to do it on your own.
We also suggest that trust in the management of money be formalized.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills if you are not able to do so.
Think of the need for immediate medical care for one of your old parents, so they're taking him to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer the questions about drugs and allergies?
Write such information in order to be ready.
"It's not just about finance, it's about who the doctors are," Martin says,
which drugs can be used and
I don't know who's watching the dog.
"Prepare a plan like this."
In Ilfracoum, a man shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man shot several times with a pneumatic rifle when he was coming home from a party.
The 40-year-old victim was in Oxford Grove in Ilfracoum, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
The officers described the shooting at 2:30 p.m. in British age as "unfortunate."
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His wounds are not a threat to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a massive earthquake and a tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, reporting to government officials, but the number of casualties can increase.
As a result of the break-up of the system of communications, the officials involved in the provision of humanitarian assistance are not able to get any information from Dongal Regents, an area to the north of Pale, which is nearing the epicentre of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7,5 points.
After a natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Pale.
Let us give a few basic facts about the city of Palau on Sulawesi Island and the Dongal Regentship.
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 according to the data for 2017.
When the earthquake was called by the tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th.
Dongala is a regential that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi.
According to the data for the year 2017, there are some 299,200 people in the administrative region, located in the lower part of the province.
Fishing and farming are the main economics of Central Sulawesi, especially the Dongal coast.
Nickel is also important in the province, but it's mostly focused on the Seaval, on the other side of the Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian agency for the mitigation of the effects of natural disasters in the past 100 years, Palau and Dongala have suffered from the tsunamis several times.
In 1938, more than 200 people died as a result of tsunamis in Dongal and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of the Dongal, and nine people died.
Indonesia is located in a seismic Pacific fire ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
The following are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a massive earthquake on the west coast of Aceh, in the northern part of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the province of Aceh.
2005: At the end of March, early in April, a series of massive earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 points hit the south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: The city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra, was hit by an earthquake of 7.6 points.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7,5 points hit one of the islands of Mentawai near Sumatra, causing up to 10 meters of tsoons, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A fragile earthquake hit the Regentship of Godjai in Aceg, causing ruins and panics due to the fact that people have not yet been able to forget the devastating earthquake and the tsunamis of 2004.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed in the rubble of the building.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Lombok Island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed countless homes, and thousands of tourists could not leave the island immediately.
Sarah Palin, the oldest son, was arrested for domestic violence
The track of Palin, the eldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested for the charge of attack.
According to a report on Saturday by the state of Alaska, 29-year-old Palin of Wasilly, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence and charged with obstructing a report of an incident of violence and resisting the arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman I know tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is on guard in the Matanusca-Civil Insulator with a 500-dollar bill.
He went to court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent" when he was asked if he confessed his guilt, and was reported online.
Palina is charged with three offences in class A, which presuppose an arrest of one year and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with class B offences, which is punishable by a day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that a criminal charge has been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, phoned the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as his failure to report an incident of domestic violence and to carry weapons in a state of drunkenness when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans for justifying her son’s brutal behavior by post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, an earthquake caused tsunamis: hundreds of people were killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawes on Friday.
An earthquake of 7,5 gallons caused the tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The telecommunications and power grids have come out, and the number of casualties can go up in the next few days.
The earthquake took place near the center of Sulawesi Island, located in the northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The video, which is being shared in social media, shows the moment when the element hits.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami landed on the shore.
Federal indictees demand a rare death penalty for a suspect in a New York attack.
In New York City, federal indictees demand the death penalty of Syfullo Saïp, who was suspected of having been in a terrorist attack in New York City, resulting in eight deaths – a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, the 30-year-old Saïves was said to have been on a cycle track at Home Depot Picape in the West Side, Lower Manhattan, and began to hit cyclists and pedestrians on his way.
In line with the report of the intention to get executed in the South District of New York to justify the death penalty, the indictees must prove that the Saïves "whether" killed eight people and "deliberately" caused serious bodily harm.
According to the court records, each of these counts presupposes the possibility of capital punishment.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Jury Court charged Syipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for the purpose of demanding, which is usually the case of federal defendants for organized crime, as well as the charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the persecutors who described Saïp's crime as "wretched, brutal, and wilful," this attack is the result of "genuine planning and a predetermined mind."
The victims to whom Syfulla Habibullahevich Saïp caused the injuries, harm or killing were Diego Enrice Angelini, Nicolas Cléves, Ann Laura Decadotte, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernan Ferrouche, Ernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnecco, as described in the message.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been 10 years since the last one in the South of New York City was a criminal case that is being punished with the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug dealers, and was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
For the last time, the federal death penalty was carried out in New York in 1953, and the marital couple Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs were executed after being convicted of a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were put to death on the electric table on June 19, 1953.
According to the judicial records of Saïp, a native of Uzbekistan did not show remorse the following days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said to the inquirer that he was not sorry for what he was doing.
According to the accustomed act of Syipov, the authorities told the authorities that he was inspired to launch an attack on the video IDIL he was watching on his phone.
The police report that he also asked to hang the IDIL flag in his hospital ward.
He did not plead guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Syipov, said that they were "very disillusioned" by this decision of procuration.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of admitting guilt and sentencing life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only exacerbate the mental trauma that these events have caused to all the victims," said Patton.
The side of the defense of Saïp earlier also asked the indictees not to press for the death penalty.
MP of the Conservative Party believes that NYJEL FARAJA needs to be assigned to be in charge of the Brexit talks.
Today, during a protest at the Conservative Party meeting, Nigel Faraj promised to "mobilize the national army."
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party stated that the politicians should “recognize the pressure” of the Europeans, as one of the MPs of the United Kingdom, Theresa Mae, has offered to stand for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bone, said on a March in Birmingham, that the United Kingdom "would have come out" if Mr. Faraj was a secretary to Brexit.
The attention to the problems that May was facing in an effort to reconcile her deeply divided rows was even more aroused by the fact that members of the Conservative Party, who are opposing the exit, joined a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The primer is trying to implement the Chequers compromise plan despite the attacks by Brexit supporters, the opponents, and the EU.
The allies insist that it will not stop trying to negotiate with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and will make Europeans and labourers choose between what it offers and "choos."
At the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihal, Mr. Bone said he wanted to "remove the Chequers."
He offered Mr. Faraj to step out of the shadows and take on the responsibility for the talks with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd be out," he said.
MP Wellingborough added, "I will support Brexit, but we have to give up the Chequers."
Addressing the EU, he said, "We didn't go to war in world wars to subjugate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone reneged on the assumption that after the vote in 2016, public opinion had changed: "The idea that the British had changed their mind and didn't want to go out was completely untrue."
A member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of Brexit, Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to reporters, "I'm just saying, "Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it's not backed up by our party and our activists, who are actually on the streets and are fighting for the votes of the electors.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In her address to Theresa Mae, she added, "The Prime Minister keeps his position when he delivers his promises."
Mr. Faraj said that the politicians should be "to be under pressure" if they were to give up the decision taken in the referendum in 2016.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political elyte," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them they're not gonna get away with it."
In a report to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want our political elitis, who is planning to betray Brexit, to feel under pressure.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country, which will lead us to the victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-conscious, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the opponents of the exit passed by Birmingham, and then held a two - hour meeting in the center of the city.
A number of actives waved "Conservatives vs. Brexit" banners when the group was launched with this output.
The Labour Lord Adonis made fun of the conservatives because, after the opening of the conference, security problems had arisen through their party program.
"These people are telling us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-Plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"This is a complete farce.
There's nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to "think seriously" about running for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Vorrene stated that after her November election, she would "think seriously about running for the presidency."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during the Western Massachusetts General Assembly, a representative of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about her future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is running in November for a second term against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Diel, who was a co-head of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is viewed as the main candidate who can fight Trump in 2020.
On Saturday day, her 36th meeting with the general assembly polls since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she was planning to take part in the presidential election.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington to set up the government, and to do so, there's gotta be a woman in his head."
Arrested a suspect in a gun-killed basketball player, LSU Tigers, Sims
In Baton-Rose, Louisiana, on Saturday, a suspect was arrested on Friday with a firearm from a basketball player, Wade Sims.
The Baton-Rose Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at a press conference at 11:00 a.m. in the East.
On Friday, they published a video of a gun with a request to help recognize the person on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot at Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wade Simms was shot in the head, and as a result he was killed," he said to 247sports on Saturday, the Chief of Police, Murphy J. Paul.
Wade stood up for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
The interrogator found that Simson was at the scene of the crime, with his gun, and shot at Wade Simms.
Sampson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Police Department.
Simms, which was 6 feet and 6 inches tall and played in the Junior League, grew up in Baton Rose, and played 32 games with 10 stars in the last season, and spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the field, 5.6 points, and 2.9 pick-ups.
Grand Priss of Russia: Lewis Hamilton shortened the race for the world championship after the team decided to give him the victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the time that he left Louis Gemilton on Saturday, it was clear that the Mercedes command decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas got off a good start with a poul-posting, and he was about to get over Gemilton, who was trying to keep his position on the first two turns, and gave Fettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fettel went to the Pit-stop first and left Gemilton on the tray in the tail of the race, which was about to make a decision.
The Mercedes crewman drove another circle and went out behind Fettel, but Hamilton broke into the leaders after a certain wheel-to-wheel manoeuvre, which made Ferrari's driver reluctant to leave the inner space because of the risk that it would be pressed after the double manoeuvring managed to get forward on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstoppen began from the back row of the net and stayed at number seven until the end of the first circle.
Sweats he led most of the race, because he didn't change the tires to get to the end of the race and get Kimy Rikkonen out of the fourth place.
In sum, he stopped at the PT stop on the 44th lap, but he couldn't increase the rate at the last eight, so Rikkonen landed at number four.
"This is a hard day, because Walderry was full on all weekends and was noble when he gave me the opportunity to pass.
The team did an exceptional job to sit in first and second place,' said Gemilton.
The language of the body was not astonishing
At a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein for her strong position in not making public the content of a letter from Christine Blazey Ford, who is blaming a candidate in the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh for sexual violence.
In a speech at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford's presentation to the Senate Juridical Committee, but instead expressed his view of the senatorial events, which he said had shown human “subordination, impropriety, and lies”.
"The one thing that could have happened, and all the wonderful things that have been going on in the Senate for the last few days, is anger, you see the evil people who are displaying vileness, vileness, and lies," he said.
"You're looking at the publications and the information, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you shared information?
Recall her answer... have you made public the content of the documents? - "What?
Oh, no.
I didn't tell you."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing the charges against Cavanaugh, and in early September, his content was publicized, but Feinstein denied that the information was leaked to her office.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's charge, I didn't release the information I got from her," said the Financial Committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I didn't break my promise."
But her argument didn't seem to please the president, who commented on the Sabbath meeting, "I'll tell you, her body language was not at all astonished.
She may not have done it, but I haven't seen anyone hold on to it."
Continuing to defend a candidate to the Supreme Court, who was charged with sexual violence by three women, the President assumed that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power in any way necessary.
You see vileness, abhorrentness, they don't care who you're offended, who you need to go through to get authority and control," Mediaite quotes the president.
Elite League: Dundy Stars -- Belfast Giants, 5:3
"Jiants" player Patrick Dwyer put up two pucks in a game against Dundee.
"Dandy Stars" rehabed for a five-day defeat in the league from the Belfast Giants, winning a 5-3 match and report on Saturday.
The "Jiants" got an early two-buck priority thanks to Patrick Dwyer's and Francis Boville's rolls.
Mike Sallivan and Jordan Coney levelled the score in the home game, and then Dwyer redirected the "Jiants" forward.
The Dandy player, François Bouchard, levelled the score, and the two goals of lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
It's the third in the season of the Elite League to defeat the team of Adam Kif, who won a free victory over Dundee with a score of 2:1 on Friday night in Belfast.
It's the fourth team meeting in the season, and three previous match wins by the Giants.
Dwayer left the first puck for the fourth minute (3:35) after the transfer of Kendall McFall, and four minutes later, Boville, who got the puck from David Rutherford, doubled the bill.
After the first period of stress for the 14th minute (13:10), Sallivan returned the landlords to the game, and for the 16th minute (15:16), Coney, after getting a puck from Matt Markwardt, leveled the score.
Dwyer gave the "Jayants" priority before the first break, putting his second puck at the end of the first period.
The landlords regrouped, and Bouchard rebalancing the score for the 28th minute (27:37) by putting a puck out when his team numbered it.
Thanks to the efforts of Cooney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen, at the end of the second period, for the first time led Dundee forward and secured the victory of his team in the last half of the period.
On Friday, the "Jaints" team, which has already lost four of the last five matches, will play the "Millton-Kines" game.
The air controller was killed so that hundreds of people on a plane could escape an earthquake.
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he was able to fly a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his life.
More than 800 people died and a lot of news was lost after a massive earthquake that caused the tsunamis on the island of Sulawes on Friday.
The strong subterranean push continues to shake the area, and many people are trapped in the city of Palu.
But, unlike his colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agun refused to leave his post in a very divisive tower at the Muthiar SIS Al-Jufry Airport in Palau.
He was on the spot to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, who was on the landing line at the time, was safely up in the air.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought it was going down.
He later died in the hospital.
Johns Syrite, a representative of the Indonesian Airlines Provider Company, stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News, Australia.
We have prepared a helicopter from Blikpapan to Kalimantan, who is to deliver it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We're very sorry to hear about it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of casualties can be as high as thousands, as the agency for mitigating the effects of the country's natural disasters states that access to the towns of Dongala, Siga and Butong is restricted.
"The number of victims can go up, as many of the bodies are still under the rubble, and many of them cannot be reached," states a representative of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters have devastated the city of Palau, where mass graves will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes deliver aid and food.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mom, told Sky News, "Every minute, quick help brings the bodies.
There's not enough clean water.
The mini-markets are everywhere. "
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helfund, told CNN, "The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to help the people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they're gonna find.
It's a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
President Joko Vitodo of Indonesia arrived in Pale on Sunday and called the country's military officers, "I ask you all to work day and night to do all the evac-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Early this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes on the island of Lomboque, which killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: as Air Niugini was said, after the plane fell into the lagoon, one man vanished
The airline that was executing the Pacific lagoon disaster in Micronesia now claims that one person has vanished, even though it has been previously reported that all 47 passengers and crews have been safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated that it was not possible to find a single passenger on the day of the Sabbath.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a husband and are working with local authorities, hospitals, and the investigators to do so.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane fell on the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six of the passengers were in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in a stable state.
The cause of the catastrophe and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The U.S. air company and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the landing lane.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has flown on the landing line.
American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane was very low on the ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes told us that he and others were able to get to the crash exits on a thin jet by the waist in the water.
He told us that the stewardess panicked and yelled, and that he was slightly injured in the head.
The U.S. Navy reported that seafarers who were working on the modernisation of the dock also helped in the rescue operation, bringing people to shore by means of an inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
In the last two decades, 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered air crashes, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
Analyst restored the chronology of the night on which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution slew a man who was charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Royalett, gave a witness as an expert in the field of operational development for a few hours.
He told the jury how he used the mobile phone records to play the movement of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of the murder.
Rollett, according to The Clary Ledger, told us that he had a location from a number of mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was from Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his earlier claim.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was next to Chambers, even though he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On the Sabbath, Sanford gave a witness and declared that he was not in the city that day.
When the indictees asked if Tellis was telling the truth, when he said he was in the Sanford pickup that night, Sanford said he was "because my pickup was in Nashville."
Another incompatibility was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they only knew one another for a week.
Roulette told me that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he had deleted text messages, phone calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Gail.
The defense has to put its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
The Trio Hip-hop-bearers want to challenge a negative view of the genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed group from Bristol states that the hip-hop has changed its nature – the political ideas and the struggles to solve social problems have gone away.
They want to go back to the outskirts and make the willful hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugues and the Common have recently witnessed the re-emergence of this direction in the United Kingdom, thanks to groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!!
In New York, the nanny filed a couple for release, getting a "racist" message.
In New York, the nanny filed a couple for discriminating release after she got a misdirected message from her mother complaining that she was "another black."
The marriage denies that they're going to be racist, comparing the felony to the "beating."
Lincee Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw the new nanny, Giselle Morris, who was on her first day of work in 2016, black.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
As reported by the New York Post, while she was aware of her error, Mrs. Plaxson-Flaxman felt "uncomfortable" and released Mrs. Morris, she said that her previous nanny, who was African-American, was not doing her job well, and that instead she was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Mrs. Morris was paid for one day of work, and then sent home to Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple, hoping to get a payback for her release, which she would have received in six months to live with the couple she was first hired for, though without a contract, she was to be paid $350 a day.
"I want to show them that I don't have to do this," she said, "and she added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the allegation that they would become racist, the couple stated that it was a wise decision to release Maurice, for they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they had been offended.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
We're not gonna get rid of it," said her husband, Joel Plasco.
"But would you leave your children with a man who was rudely treated, even if it was not on purpose?
Your baby?
Come on, come on.
Comparing the challenge with "extortion," Plasco said his wife only had a baby two months ago and "not even ready."
"Would you have avenged someone after this?
It's a bad thing," he added an investment banker.
Although the court is still in progress, the court of public opinion has been quick to convict the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
According to the new letter, the publishers of Padington feared that the readers would not understand the idea of a bear who was able to talk
The daughter of Bond, Karen Yankel, who was born almost immediately after the book was agreed to print, said about the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the position of the person who is reading the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's funny, because we know about the immense success that Padington's story has made."
Telling her father, who was a BBC operator, before a little toy bear inspired him to write a kid's book, was optimist about his work being rejected, she shared, as on the 60th anniversary of the book's release at the same time, "rejoicing and sadness," as the father died a year ago.
As for Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud of the fact that the book was so popular.
"He was a rather modest man and didn't like to brag," she said.
"But Padington was so real to him, like his own child! 'because when the kids get to something, we're proud of them, even though it's not theirs, not our victories.
I think he was looking at Padington's success in this way.
"Although Padington is the creation of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say good-bye to her phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the 2nd Louis Pastor Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life without success.
"Once on a regular phone, he said it was really bad, she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperus.
"And then over there phoned me and said she'd die for the next two minutes and I should say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Taschi, love, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The doctors gave her the ability to keep her heart beating, and they gradually stopped working and left her body.
She died a while before everything was shut off.
I should have just sat there and waited, knowing what was going on at this time.
I couldn't stifle, yell, or weep, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to really hold myself."
After all, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, who was saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, ignoring the severe trials she had to endure.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I put my head down and couldn't help the tears.
It was hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deeply for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered pain leave their cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones through suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfris leave a number on the Wallian Bridge that people can call for support, as well as a message to inspire them.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he killed himself.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same as I do every day," she said.
The 45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in linde, told her that her son was a promising cook with a pretty smile.
"Everyone knew him for a smile.
They always said this smile made any room lighter."
But he quit his job before he died, because he was "in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found the body of his brother after he put his life on himself.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always afraid it'll have the effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards, "to make people know there are people they can turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't shut yourself down, you have to talk."
Miss Hamfris, who had been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost her 15 - year - old husband, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was depressed, that he was depressed or so," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed he'd changed."
And on Christmas day, he was completely desolate, and when the kids opened up their presents, he didn't look in their eyes or anything."
She told me that his death was a massive trauma to them, but they have to survive it, "This has caused a ruinous
I'm going to go to the family.
But we have to keep on living and fighting."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is hanging out: the FBI is in the middle of an investigation.
"I thought that if we could get what we asked for -- restricted in time and nature of the investigation -- we might have reached some agreement," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and he added that he was afraid that the committee was "breaking up" in the background of an irreparable loss of the integrity of the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his press fans want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their resentment has to do with time.
Intermediate elections will take place in just five weeks, November 6th, and if, as expected, the Republicans have a problem, it will make it very difficult for them to try to make their own choice at the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush called the senators to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who was working at the White House for Mr. Bush's rule, and so he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, which now has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, the vote will take place.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Cavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes at the Senate sitting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pence to solve the problem with the same number of votes and to accept his candidacy as a Supreme Court judge.
During the rule of Kim, the number of North Korean crossovers "have"
After Kim Chen In came to power seven years ago, the number of transients from North Korea to South Korea was reduced by a South Korean legislator.
Park Pion Seugh, referring to the data of the South Korea United Republic of Korea, stated that the number of crossovers in the past year was 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that the key factors were the strengthening of border control between North Korea and China, and that smugglers who transport illegals now require more money.
In Pyongyang, public comments were held.
Most of the North Koreans are finally offering South Korean citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans were declared to have illegally crossed the border after the Korean War was over in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats transients as illegal migrants, not as refugees, and is often coerced to rehearse them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still in a formal state of war, has improved markedly in the last months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed the issue of denuclearization, the negotiations on which had been stalled.
This was after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen In in Singapore, where they all agreed to work together on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yon-Ho, in the background of the accepted sanctions, accused the United States of no progress since then.
"With no confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no one-size-fits-all disarmament language," said Ri Yon-Ho in his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "historical" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the position of Justice of the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, "historical" and stated that he was at the same time not fit for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've been thinking that if a woman ever acted like this, she'd be called 'historical'," Pelosi commented on her reaction to Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Juridical Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied the charge of sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Cavanaugh was very emotional during his introductory statement, sometimes almost yelled and coughed up, talking about his family and school years.
He also publicly denounced the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him an "absurd and coordinated ruin of the reputation", organized by the liberals, who were angered by the fact that Gillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
According to Pelosi, Cavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as it showed his bias towards the Democrats.
"I think that with these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he's going to take up his own candidacy," she said.
Pelosi was offended when asked if she would try to give Cavanaugh an impeachment, if his guilt was confirmed, and if the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say, if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not just for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he works now," said Pelosi.
Cavanaugh is now serving as a judge of the United States Court of Appeal in Columbia County.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions against the Accessible Medical Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the issue of confirmation at Cavanaugh’s office, the question was whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"Now is not the time when a judge will become a hysterical, prejudiced person and we will say how wonderful it is," said Pelosi.
Women must possess this weapon.
These are just words that have been accumulated in months and years of anger, and she could not say them without tears.
"We weep when we're mad," she said to me 45 years later, Miss Steinem.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "One woman who was somewhere working as an executive director, and she was very helpful to me, and she said she was crying when she was mad, but she had her own method, and when she got mad and started crying, she said to her friend, "You can think I'm sad, and that's why I'm crying.
And I am evil."
And then she just went on.
I thought it was incredible."
Tears are considered to be an acceptable way out of anger, in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my best memories of my first job at the office, where men were mostly employed, was a situation where one time I wept out of an indistinct anger, and an older woman, an unwelcome manager I've always been a bit afraid of, grabbed me by a cell and dragged me to the sunset cage.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to get to you."
Patricia Schrader, then a Democrat Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was caught on an extra-marriage link on board a boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, the deeply disillusioned Mrs. Schrader decided that there was no reason why she couldn't run for the presidency.
"It was not a very thoughtful decision," she said to me with a laugh after 30 years.
"Seven other candidates already took part in the race, and another candidate was the last thing they needed."
Some called the situation "Sweet and Seven Dwarves."
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was behind in the fundraiser, so she made a promise that she would not take part in the race if she didn't save $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who had no regrets for men’s support of $1,000, had given her only $250.
"Do they think I'm gonna get a cut?" she marveled.
When she spoke and announced that she would not hold an official campaign, she was emotionally moved – thanks to the people who supported her, the disillusionment of the system, which made the collection of money very difficult, and made her not so focused on the voters as the members of the House of Deputies, and the anger of sexism.
"You'd think I'd have a nervous breakdown," says Mrs. Schrader, "the press response.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
Did I still think about what they would write on my tombstone?
"She was crying?"
How the US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The experts believe that the first steps in the US-China trade war have been desperate, and, while far from being over, the long-term perspective of the division between countries can be of benefit to Beijing.
US President Donald Trump made the first warning shots earlier this year, taxing major Chinese export goods, such as solar, steel, and aluminum.
The situation has become worse this week because of new tariffs on goods at a total cost of $200 billion (GBP 150 billion), which actually taxes half of all goods that come to the US from China.
Peking paid back with the same coin every time, recently putting a tomato in the size of five to ten percent on American goods for $60 billion.
China has committed itself to similar US actions, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to miss the opportunity to keep to this promise in the short run.
Making Washington stand back means accepting the demands, but for China’s president, Xi Jingpin, the US public worship is too shameful.
But, as experts say, if Beijing is making the right use of the situation, the pressure in the US trade war can give China a long-term perspective, reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"A quick political decision in Washington or Peking can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic fall in any country, and this is in fact a greater threat than the observers have previously admitted," said an analist, Abigail Grace, who deals with Asia-related issues at the Center for New American Security.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs has stated that Syria is "prepared" for the return of the refugees.
In Syria, they claim to be ready for the voluntary return of the refugees and to seek help in the reconstruction of a country devastated by the war that lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that conditions in the country were improving.
"The real situation today has become more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government has continued to rebuild the terrorized areas so that people can return to normal life.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they have been forced to leave because of terrorism, as well as one-sided economic measures that have affected their daily lives and restricted their means of subsistence.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Mualem stated that the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild a war-torn country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the oppressive action.
Europe fortifies the victory of the Rider Cup in Paris.
The European team conquered the Ryder Cup in 2018, when the U.S. team won a sum of 16.5:10.5 on Le Golf National in the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated in Europe for the sixth time since 1993 and has not won the Cup of Ryder.
Europe returned the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mikkelson, who worked hard for most of the tower, hit his first long-distance punch on the 16th hole of steam-3 in the water, and went to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever went through the 5–0–0 from the start of a modern-style tour in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit has been defeated with a score of 5:4 from the lowest-rated player in the European Turbierne Olesen team in Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who is on the top of the world's ratings, went down with account 2:1 for Jan Polter from England, who may have been in the last round of the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard, Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the Rubber Cup, who has already been on the tour eight times, has become a European who has won most of the tours all the time, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a hard year.
Thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad, so glad to return the cup.
It's a team's job, and I'm glad I was able to help," he said, without limiting his emotions, after he won in Europe.
He's handing it over to his countryman John Reem, who won the American golf legend of Tiger Woods on Sunday in a single game with a score of 2:1.
"I'm incredibly proud to win over Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods has lost all four matches and now has a career record for "The Ryder Cup" 13–21–3.
Wonderful statistics for one of the most prominent players of all time, who won 14 Major Tourners, with only Jack Niclaus.
The U.S. Congregation has been trying to get to the fairway zone for all weekends, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Phinea, who have shown high-level golf throughout the tour.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said about his team after a disconcerting presentation, "I'm proud of these guys, they've been fighting.
This morning, we took over Europe for a short time.
We fought.
I'm taking off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, and I'm gonna work with the United States Association of Professional Players and the Cup of Ryder Touring Committee, and we're gonna move forward.
I love those 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We can't help but laud them.
We've lost."
Current information on the Red Flux: Declining Concentration in Pinellas, Manat and Sarasota
The most recent report of the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife indicates a general decline in the level of red-coloured micro-organisms in some parts of the Tumpa Bay.
According to the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife, the conditions of rich bloom, reported in some regions of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier, show a decline in concentration.
The blossoms of red - colored microorganisms extend about 130 miles of the coastline from North Pinellas to the southern districts of Lee.
The tracks can be found about 10 miles off the shore of Hillsboro County, but less than last week.
The red tide was also observed in the district of Pascoe.
Last week, there was a report of an average concentration in Pinellas County and the coast, a concentration from low to high in the Hillsborough Bay Bay, a high concentration in Manat County, a high concentration in Sarasota County and the Coast Zone, an average concentration in Charlotte County, a high concentration in Li County and the Coast Zone, and a low concentration in Collier County.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier, they continue to report an asphyxiation.
No such messages were registered in the Northwest of Florida last week.
