28-year-old cook found dead in the San Francisco mall.
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell of a local shopping center this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "He's finally getting along."
- The body found in Westfield Moll on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, reported to the San Francisco Forensics Bureau.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that the death was classified as a murder and the investigation is still under way.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, told KGO of ABC in San Francisco that Frank, the last cook of the distribution line in Boston, got his job as a cook at San Francisco's Suns & Daugters six months ago.
The Spokesman of the Sons & Daugters said that they were "shocked and crushed" by his death.
"We're a small team that works like a close family and will be very missed," the representative said.
Our thoughts and sympathies to Frank's family and friends during this difficult period.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was staying at the hostels first, but he's been doing well lately.
"He found an apartment, he met a girl," Luis Galicia said to KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
He had a good soul and a big heart.
His way of communicating with the family has always been to make us some dish, to make us a meal," said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any argument.
He was a brother who was on his way.
"In all the bad things that are happening to this world, he was the unbridled diamond that shined brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information is asked to call the SFPD Hot Line at number 415-575-4444.

The Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, said that the last UN Security Council meeting on the Crimea had been useful, handing over Interfax.
"I think the discussion was good for us, and we gave them information about what happened," said Churkin.
He explained that, in closed consultations, he had provided Member States with information on the incidents in the territory of the Republic of Crimea and read out a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, which “expressed concern and indignation at the attempt to commit an attack and sabotage in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.

Italy ' s public debt rose to record levels
Italy's public debt in June 2016 was more than 2,248 trillion euro.
The central bank of the country has stated that this sum is the highest in history, and has sent the RIA News.
The previous negative record was set in May this year.
The amount of public debt was then 2,228 trillion euro.
In the first half of the year, Italy's debt burden has increased by Euro77.2 billion.
Italy ' s public debt at the end of 2015 was previously reported to be 132.7 per cent of the country ' s GDP.
In the meantime, the Italian Minister of Economics and Finance, Pierre Carlo Padoan, projected a drop to 130.9 per cent in 2016 and 123.4 per cent of GDP in 2018.
The airport paid 141 victims of the Domodedovo attack.
141 people received a donation from the Airlines Foundation, which was set up by the Domodedovo Airport to help the victims of the attack in 2011, reports Interfax.
According to the Spokesman for the airport of Alexander Vlasov, two more statements are currently under consideration.
“The Foundation is continuing to make charitable payments to the victims of the 2011 attack and is providing full assistance to address the current issues,” Vlasov added, recalling that a site of the Foundation was set up specifically to facilitate interaction with the victims, providing full information on the way in which the charitable assistance is provided.
In 2011, in the hall of arrival of foreign airlines, a Domodedo bomber detonated an explosive device.
As a result of the attack, 37 people have been killed, and 172 more have been injured.
Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
The international group of biologists has concluded that the longest-lived vertebrates are the Greenland polar shark, who can live for about 500 years, who is relaying RT.
Scientists have done a radio-carbon analysis of the eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is more than five meters long, can be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that low metabolism plays an important role in the longevity of a shark, leading to slow development.
Mothers of Greenland sharks reach puberty by the age of 150.
In the past, it was thought that the longest vertebrates live in a "neighbourly" shark, a green whale.
The oldest man, known as a scientist, was just over the age of 210.
Putin has reconfigured the Sobeza of the Russian Federation.
The Russian President, Vladimir Poetin, by his decree, changed the composition of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, reporting to the press service of the Kremlin.
It has been reported earlier that Putin has removed President Sergei Ivanov's head of administration, and Anton Wyno has been appointed as his successor.
Ivanov will now be a special representative of the President on environmental, environmental and transport issues.
Of the permanent members of the FM, the FM has been expelled as a member of the Council, Rashid Nurgaliev.
The council includes Sergey Ivanov, Anton Wyno, the half-time president of the FOO, Sergey Mégilo, and half-cent of the FZFO, Nikolai Tsukanov.
Sergei Ivanov has been dismissed from office as head of the President ' s Administration.
By a decree of President Sergei Ivanov, he was dismissed from office as head of the Kremlin.
Ivanov has been appointed Special Representative of the Russian Federation for Environment, Environment and Transport.
Anton Wyno has been appointed as the new head of the administration, and he has previously served as Deputy Sergei Ivanov.
According to Wladimir Poetin, Ivanov himself asked him to move to another job.
Should we go to the sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is Olga Bogos Sanatorium Chief Doctor.
And if a man is well, just tired of his work, should he go to the sanatorium?
Sanatorium resort rest is needed not only for the treatment, but also for the prevention of disease.
Under sanatorium conditions, a person can check his or her body and receive advice from a doctor on how to live so that his or her health will not be eroded.
No one would need such advice.
"I'm just sick of work" is an important signal to my body, and you don't have to get rid of it.
Sustained stress, mental and physical stress can lead to depression and chronic fatigue.
And the stress is around 90% of the people who come.
It is the most prone to people in big cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it's best not to make things worse and let yourself rest on time.
Research has shown that 98% of people have lowered their biological age while in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to spend your vacation with the kids, you don't have to leave them.
For children, even the youngest, there are health-care programmes that include both diagnostic services, paediatric counselling, testing and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, Oxygen cocktails, and medicinal exercise.
The course of the procedure is determined by the doctor, taking into account the individual statement and the features of the growing body.
In addition, the sanatoriums tend to have a children ' s club with animators, where children can go to play classes, and a variety of workshops.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for visitors with infants, provide the necessary facilities for breasts, and provide the services of an experienced nanny.
The soft winter, the long summer, the abundance of sunny days in the year (over 300) creates a good environment for a year-round vacation at the Caucasian Mineral Water resorts.
And then the body doesn't just need to rest in the summer.
So you don't have to be afraid of the weather out the window, especially since most of the procedures are indoors, and they don't depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium and resort treatment is desirable twice a year, especially for adults.
The main feature of the Kaukasian Mineral Water region is, of course, the curative minerals: Slavsky, Smirnovsky, Estentuki, Narzan.
Their water has unique properties and has an impact on the various systems of the body.
Water differs by temperature, number of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor picks up water depending on the patient's health.
For example, Narzan has an anti-inflammatory, immuno-energizing effect, re-establishing the gastrointestinal tract and the exchange of substances.
Essentuki-4 is affecting the gastrointestinal tract, lowering the sugar level.
"Escentuki is new" has an anti-inflammatory, galling, and wetting effect.
The water of Slavic has the same effects.
The doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system when assigning water.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks up less salty water, because the salts hold the liquid, which increases the pressure.
The reception of mineral water requires moderation: water should be consumed at a certain time, at the right quantity and at a specific temperature.
The sanatoriums are now open to various cosmetic procedures for the face and the body.
What types of recovery, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be found in the resorts of the region?
In the vicinity of Pigorsk, for example, there is a salty Lake of Tambukan, which is used to make it work for joints, spine, and internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammation, suspensive, immunomodulative effect.
It's a healthful hike on individual paths.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
It is popular in Kislovodsk, which is in close proximity to the Narzan mineral source.
There you can also take baths of wine, pearls, yovalents, seleniums, salty-lacry, depending on what you get a doctor to do.
Let's continue the fruitage.
What can we do to make the harvest go to the end of the season?
Says Julia Belopukhov, an agrin and a maid.
It's time for the tall tomatoes to do a haircut: take out the new stepchildren, cut off the macs, remove all the leaves to the penultimate brush with the fruits and the blossoms with the small bandages - they'll never grow up.
All tomatoes, irrespective of the “constitution”, as well as peppers and aubergines, are fed with ultra-superphosphate tracts, biomedicines (Speaker - to speed up the flow and growth of fruit, Phytosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamair, Baktofit - from disease, Immunocytophyte - to increase immunity, Bitoxibazillin, Lepidocide, Phytoverm - if there are pests).
The only chemical means used at the end of the summer are copper dowry, colloide sulfur, and green soap.
Let's do the last plant water.
The long-naked cucumbers in the casing are dropped from the wallpaper so that the lower, tanned part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, watered with warm water and a solution to the Circon, sprinkling the stem of 5 to 7 cm compost.
It is also easy to extend the fruitage of the courgette by cutting off the old leaves, spilling warm water and a solution to complex fertilisers, planting the fertile soil under the bush.
To protect you from the cold of the night, set up an arc of concealed material over the ridge.
Keep the plant open during the day, and close it after sundown.
Marks of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
The economists have seen signs of Russia’s exit from the longest recession in the last 20 years.
According to Bloomberg analysts, the GDP of the Russian Federation has shown a positive turnaround - in the second quarter, GDP fell by 0.8 per cent in annual terms.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, the Russian economy slowed down to 0.6 per cent in the second quarter.
Central Bank and Mino-Economy have also recently reported on the stabilization of the situation.
Slow growth ahead.
According to CBD experts, the recession in the Russian economy has been in the past.
“The index estimate of Russian GDP indicates that the recession is behind us, and the slow growth of the economy ahead,” states the Bank of Russia’s Newsletter, “What Trends Say.
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter has been up to 0.4 per cent by regulators, and the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5 per cent.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Environment and Development, in the second quarter the fall in the Russian Federation ' s GDP had stagnated in the second quarter, at 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally purified decline in GDP was 0.2 per cent by the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, it stopped: in April, it was 0.2%, and in May and June, the change in GDP was between 0-0.15,” quotes the IER of the RIA, "News".
The slowing down of the Russian economy in the last five quarters indicates that “the bottom has passed”.
Among the other markers indicating signs of a national economic recovery, Bloomberg refers to an increase in the demand for electricity and rail transport, and a renaissance of business.
If you make an adjustment to the fact that the year is high, it is clear that the trend of plus 1% of the electricity consumption can be due half to the extra working day.
Add to this the lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight transport, but it's hard to get the exact data, and plus or minus 0.5% of the semi-annual volume can also be explained by the seasonality,” explains Kirill Jacobenko of ALOR BORKER.
There are, however, other, more obvious signs of a stable Russian economy.
For example, lowering the price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent, compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
In fact, Rossstat has been deflationing for the last two weeks.
Prices in Russia have fallen for the first time in five years.
If you look at the evolution of the rouble, which, while showing strong swings at the beginning of the year, the result of August has been 12% more.
This is also one of the signs of recovery that indicators from the real sector of the economy should follow,” Yakovenko emphasizes.
In addition, there has been an increase in industrial production in the Russian Federation since April.
The rate rose by 1.7 per cent in June.
The rate of international trade falling from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May is slowing down.
The situation in the labour market, where the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.4 per cent, also demonstrates a positive development.
The following was only in September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the question of the real disposable incomes of the population is to be left to the best.
In annual terms, the rate is down by 4.8 per cent.
This may hinder the recovery of the economy, as household spending is a major contributor to GDP.
Generally, their share in the structure of the economy is over 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the hard policy of the Bank of Russia can also be described as a risk to economic growth.
The regulator has a rate of 10.5 per cent, which is not the best effect on the real sector.
A negative factor is also the low level of investment, which hinders the development of industrial capacity.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year the rate of fall of the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5 per cent, as opposed to -3.7 per cent in 2015,” Irina Rogova, an Analyst of the GC Forex Club.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football, and well developed in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, has not yet been so active in summer sports.
While in the Rio Olympics the former foreigners are in favor of Russia, in most cases they are from the former Soviet republics.
But in Rio, we can see the reverse, with a very large number of Russians flying the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of the change of nationality differs.
Some of the parents took them to another country when they were kids without a choice.
Someone couldn't stand the competition for a seat in the Russian team.
And someone thought that there would be better conditions for development in sport abroad.
AIF.ru has found at least 16 athletes who have decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of a 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa Red.
But she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in the city of Omsk in 1988.
Just four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union fell apart, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl didn't have a choice.
That's where she decided to follow in her older sister's footsteps - to do a little athletic.
Like the sister, Lisa chose to jump from the sixth.
If she was to stay in Russia, I don't think she'd have been able to "turn off the throne" by Helen Isinbaev.
Sadly, at the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be our only countryman, even if she was an ex, in the 6th jumping sector.
Her best performance in this form of sport is the bronze of the 2010 European Cup and the silver of the mainland in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Helena Isinbaeva.
She was born in Novokuznski in 1986.
Her parents are religious evangelical propagandists.
Much because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was just three.
In addition to Helena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in a small town in Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena began to get into fighting when she was in high school.
With good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where she continued to study at the U.S. Training Center under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izbojnikov.
At the 2012 London Olympics, Elena lost her first fight.
But at the World Cup in the same year, it's a win.
By the way, she's been able to win the silver at the 2010 world headline.
After that, there was a 2013 bronze and a 2014 silver.
Mary, 26, was born in Yaroslavla, where she first met synchronized swimming.
But it would be wrong to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia.
The girl’s family soon decided to emigrate to the United States and to live in Colorado.
There Mary continued her classes.
She was a member of the U.S. team and was showing excellent results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that, at a serious international level, it cannot compete with Russian synchronists, but for America, it is the ceiling.
A new name, which sounds strange in Russian, was given to Christina Schaldibina at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue to train the girl in the arts beyond the ocean.
So far, the girl has been doing her favorite sport in her native Jaroslavla.
After emigrating to the United States, she quickly joined the country's youth team, and later entered the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen conquered gold and silver.
She certainly didn't have to fight for the first positions on the world scene, but for the US, she's made a real breakthrough -- a star-size team at the Rio Olympics.
Another ex-artist of ours is Jan Berezko-Margrander, who is in favor of Germany.
She was born in Toliati.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had a better chance of joining the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 London Olympics.
There, though, Ian was only able to take the 17th place, not enough to get into the finals in her own first place.
But two years earlier, she was able to win a bronze medal for the Olympics, a young man.
Another gymnast, just this time, is Irina Sazonova.
If the way of migrating the former athletes can be described as standard, the choice of Irina's family is very unusual in Iceland.
Ira is a student of the Walgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland, she immediately became the country's champion.
True, Ira is still training in Russia - he's coming to his home country on purpose to keep his skill.
She didn't do as well as she wanted to do in Rio.
The best place is 40 in a private multi-war.
There is very little news of the swimmer Maria Coalkova in the Russian information area.
For a very long time, Mary has been living and training in Switzerland.
But for a long time, it has been under the Russian flag, showing good results - even the country's record for 200 meters of butterfly.
In 2015, she acquired Swiss citizenship and began to fly a red-and-white flag.
In Rio, her best presentation is number 14 in the 4×100 integrated relay.
To get to the game, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, which was able to raise about 6000 francs, which enabled her to pay for the preparations for the Olympics.
A 31-year-old free-style fighter, Adam Batirov, spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
In that time, Hasaurt's native was the three-time champion of European championships, Russia's champion, and Russia's international class sports master.
When he stopped joining our national team, it was time to think about a change of nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter vanished from the sports outposts.
A triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Cup - Batirov has already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and won a trip to the Rio Olympics.
There's one more Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, who is even less known in the country than the Swiss swimmer Mary Ugholkov.
The fact is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
That's where Mikhail began his gymnastics.
It has not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio, the best result was the 40th place in parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympics in gymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her class of synchronized swimming, showing good results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Cup in Berlin, the girl was ranked 6th in a synchronized swim.
In a duo with Eugenia, Tethelbaum Anastasia was ranked eight.
In the solo program, she was the fifth.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dimitri Croiter is in favor of Israel.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dimitri was the country's champion.
He won the World Cup in the same year.
A year later, Croiter won the gold of the Singapore Young Olympics.
In addition to leaping in height, Dmitri has a long and a threefold leap.
31-year-old Albert is another native of Hasaurth, who, after a long talk for Russia, has decided to change his sports citizenship.
But, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In the Russian Federation, he was a champion of the Krasnoyarsk High School of Sport, even becoming a champion of the country in 2011.
The 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow as a member of the USSR volleyball player, Jaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before his son was born, Jaroslav was considered the best volleyball player on the planet.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
There, the family remained permanent.
In 2015, he became a bronze champion of the European championship in his new country.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and was born with his family in the middle of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get to this northern country -- to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn to fight free.
Soon, he won the world's highest among the juniors, and later qualified to participate in the Olympics.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the competition.
And again a free fight, and again a former Russian.
This time we're talking about a native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain, Taimuraz Frieva.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and he is currently in favour of the country's team.
It is true that a 30-year-old sporter has been able to record high performances in Russia.
He became a bronze champion of the 2007 and 2008 championships.
The statute of non-entry, Timuraz decided to change his sports citizenship.
The last one on our list is a Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Daguestan Mahachkal, Arthur Biarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
That's where Arthur, on the advice of his big brother, started boxing.
Since then, Arthur has been a champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he was a champion of the world among the young.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new home country since 1975.

Married, son.
Why do kids have cossack classes in school?
According to Governor V. Condratiyev, "speakers need to be brought up in a system-wide manner, not by actions and parades."
They have to grow up and understand from at least 7 years of age that they are cossacks and education must be cossacks.
But as far as I'm concerned, this job is being formalized and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the cossack classes take in all the positive things that have been built up earlier, at a qualitatively new level, I'd be happy to.
If everything's up and down, and you don't know how, the new idea will turn out to be a cheap populism.
The VCS continues to be one of the country ' s most criminal sectors.
There is an intruder of the company with funds allocated to the public sector from the various levels of the budget.
According to the Attorney-General's Office, overpriced tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the area of VCL.
As a result, the region ' s consumers over-paid over 170 million roubles.
Recently, the Krasnodar State Prosecutor ' s Office also found that there was undue cost to the tariffs.
And the cost of the OLG “IV-consultation” (cold water) was 4 million roubles for the rental of cars at a price higher than the market.
And there's a lot of such examples in the country.
The public pays the last money for the "community" and pays it well - according to the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94 per cent.
He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code: embezzlement, legalization of the proceeds of crime, abuse of authority, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund who was working on the renovation of the city, Makarov entered into contracts with the businessmen, the work on them was in fact not carried out, but paid for.
Businessmen just gave him most of the money back.
And as the owner of the PC, Makarov collected money from the public, but the service providers didn't pay and spent it on their own.
As a result, there are millions of roubles to the budget and to the tenants.
Macarov's scheme of scams is, unfortunately, typical of Russia.
There has been a wave of arrests and detentions of the heads of the Criminal Code, who have embezzled the money of the citizens.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kohan, by the way, is also under way with a former councillor, who is charged with 91.7 million roubles of fraud.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013, in the city of Elizovo, Kamchatsk province, he created 6 company managers and created 3 limited liability societies.
One of them was engaged in contractual work for the CC, the other two played the role of cash centres, i.e., receiving money from the public.
But A. Cohan's energy didn't donate the money, but spent it on his loved one.
Judging in the area of GKH is very difficult.
Things don't start, things get slow.
And "helps" in this very complicated housing law, Svetlana Rotoveva, the executive director of the NPA, "WHA Control."
We don't have time to make one law, as we come up with a new one to make the previous one work.
There are also few specialists, including judges, in the area of VCS.
The legal profession itself acknowledges that very little attention is given to housing law in higher education institutions.
The Attorney-General's Office has also talked about the refusal to institute criminal proceedings, and the use of fissures in the course of the investigations.
Of the 3,500 crimes in progress in 2015, less than half have been sent to court.
The rest of the investigation was of a protracted nature, and one in five was suspended due to the lack of identification of the accused.
Frequently, the shortcomings in law enforcement have been attributed to gaps in existing legislation.
There is a law, but the Investigative Departments are slow to instigate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 allegations of forgery - only 60 criminal cases have been brought.
In the five months of this year, the number has increased only marginally, 99.
And what is falsifying the minutes of the tenants' meeting?
This means that changes in the management of the house, and financial and other issues tend to sway the views of the owners.
It also means that the housing and public services market cannot be accessed by normal companies that want to work honestly, not to “cool” the population.
So the tenants are minus, the small and the middle business, too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption per se throughout the State, Anton Jarkov, a member of the State Property Committee.
This work is now under way.
This is not just a single action; it is a focused approach to the fight against corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, the capital doesn't smell like a scandal.
Why is there no such scandal in Moscow in the area of VCS as in many other regions?
Because the capital government has shown iron will and brought order, Anatoly the Chosen One, a member of the State Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, told AIF.
I'm talking about the human resource issue, the legislative amendments, and legal education.
Superintendents are subject to close supervision, and all of them have been licensed.
Citizens ' complaints are dealt with quickly in public space (and addresses by tenants, and response measures are available on the Government of Moscow ' s portal).
A lot of people don't just pay monthly receipts, but keep an eye on what it says about the house.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and the obligations of resource and management organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow is testing the soundness of the housing and public service fares, as a large part of the budget goes to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
I guess all of this together explains the quiet situation in Moscow.
So it's all in the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe you're gonna have to change your place of work.
Turkish gumbit.
Will Erdogan be able to give up his friendship with the EU and the US?
The President of Turkey, Regep Tayyyip Erdoğan, put forward an ultimatum to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d ' état.
He spoke to his supporters in Ankara about this.
Erdogan called on Americans to give up their support for the "Terrorist Fethullahist Organization."
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the US is calling for a change of position.
The experts believe that the division between Turkey and the West is on the rise and can lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
“America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO, the Terorist Fethullist Organization.
Either the FETO coup or the democratic Turkey.
She has to make this choice," quotes the Anatoly Agency's Erdogan address on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but he has made a stricter call on the US to comply with his demands, which he made for the first time in the wake of the upheaval.
Let us recall that, on the night of 16 July, the Turkish Army made an attempt to overthrow legitimate authority in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the Head of State.
However, after Regep Erdogan addressed the population, the mutiny was overwhelmed, and its organizers and participants were arrested.
In all, about 8,000 people have been suspected of being in the ranks of teachers and scientists, in addition to the military.
According to Regep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdogan’s supporters also admitted that Americans could be directly involved in the state war.
The United States rejected all the claims, refusing to hand over Guillen and recommending a change in tone.
The State Department ' s last statement in this regard was made at the time of Erdogan ' s visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
But this does not stop the President of Turkey – he insists on it and also puts demands on his other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to meet its obligations under the European Union's migration agreement if Brussels does not set a date for the lifting of the visa restrictions for Turkish citizens,” the Turkish Minister for EU Affairs, Omer Chelik, stated on 9 August.
He said that the change of the anti-terrorist law by the United States of America, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe’s own security.
Note that on August 1, Germany’s Vice-Chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the EU with promises to open up borders to migrants in order to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His remarks responded to the relevant statement made by the head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mevluth Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement by Chavushoglu was made last Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not ruled out that the country will consider withdrawing from the alliance if it does not receive the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence field is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that are working with foreign states in the defence field - they import missiles," said Chavushoglu in an interview with Anadolu.
He said that Turkey now needed to set up its own defence system on the basis of its own technology, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
“Turkish has so far tried to cooperate with the member countries of NATO, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have begun to look for others,” the Minister said.
The experts believe that all of this speaks of Turkey’s serious disagreements with the West and the country’s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Regep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot face a strict confrontation with the West.
He has a lot to do with the West, in terms of business, and from a military point of view (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to strike a balance by maintaining a framework with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a fully obedient man in this post," the expert explained to AIF.ru.
He said it might be possible that, after the Turkish leader’s statements (on the non-payment of EU compensation, the demand for a visa-free space with Europe, and the release of Guillena from the United States) he would be pressed.
"Regeep Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with America and the European Union, and they will push it on just humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of government, and so on," Minchenko says.
The head of the Center for Political Information, Alexei Muhin, admits that the President of Turkey will change his point of view with Russia as soon as he enjoys it.
Eight months ago Erdoğan was very hard on Russia and in every way sought favor in the West.
In a very short time, the situation has changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that, after a while, the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again.
I think Erdogan has entered the period of shuttle diplomacy.
If he is between the two poles, the West and Russia, he will try to make the best of himself,” Muhin says.
In his view, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to hold political power in the country, and to do so, he needs Russia and a partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop the US from supporting Guelen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus will be reached with Turkey,” the expert considers.
Anna Glassova, head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East, has a different view.
Now, Turkey’s relationship with the EU and the US is rather strained, and this is primarily due to Erdogan’s own domestic policy.
I think that this crisis in relations will worsen, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reset the policy in both the Middle East and Russia.
It is not by chance that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, claim that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, have been settled with Israel, are engaged in active political engagement with Iran,” explains Aif.ru Glassov, which suggests that Erdogan’s next step will be to normalize relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy currently being pursued by Erdoğan is to return to the foreign-policy approach followed by Turkey before the Arab revolution.
“It was at that time, at the “zero problem with neighbours” position, that Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region.
There have now been very successful visits by the President of Turkey to Russia and Africa.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and promote Turkey's position on the regional as well as on the international scene,” the expert believes.
The eye is of the view that it will be incredibly difficult to return Turkey to its previous relationship with the EU, and the question now is whether the EU will begin to respond harshly to Turkey, which can open up borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Paramedics strike: Calling for new collective protest
Representatives of the paramedics asked the trade union to approve new collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) JDC is about to ask its full board to support more collective protests from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers have not been able to answer the questions about the employment contract.
In July, the junior physicians and medical students voted to cancel the contract of employment agreed to by BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members voting by secret ballot.
In a letter to the members on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chairman Ellen McCord said that the government continued to “stay silently” about the problems she said had led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said, "Bearing in mind the current situation, the head of the JDC voted in favour of rejecting the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiations on all your issues."
In response to the Government's silence, JDC's head today made a formal request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a continuous program to expand the collective protest, starting in early September.
The dispute led to the participation of young doctors in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the Public Health Service.
BMA's associate doctor, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after a vote on the cancellation of the agreed terms of the employment contract, which BMA recommended.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one, to be accepted, during the meetings leading up to the vote of 54,000 paramedics and medical students.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that this contract of employment would be used for health-care workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "The Alliance of Bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I had the strong impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yeah.
But Mr. Poetin's smile looked strained, and he hardly emitted warmth even by his own tempered standards.
In contrast, Regep Tayyyip Erdoğan spoke of his dear friend, Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I've lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even more.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan's actions as if nothing bad ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But the tightening coolness from Mr. Putin has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first one he mentioned in the introductory remarks: Turkey hit a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was wild.
Mr. Poetin erupted with an angry tirade, blaming Ankara for punching Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse on the basis of an alleged friend.
The restoration of real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media have waged a staggering, total attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed that the Turks should be held guilty of everything.
The most serious were the accusations from the top management that Mr. Erdogan's own family was profited from the illegal trade in oil from the Syrian-controlled areas of the so-called Islamic State.
He denounced it with determination.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin was given the apology he was demanding from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim to win in a way.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost deposed from his post last month in an attempted coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shook him, too.
There is also an economic reason.
The Russian sanctions have hit hard, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring a few million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen sharply by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, the tour operators and the charter companies here will, of course, be relieved when the flights finally resume.
They put it at the peak of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, public TV predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish import of agricultural products was allowed again.
"The tomatoes are there, the tomatoes are back here," as the report in the report states.
But the visit also had an added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is mad at the West for considering it a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this her long-running dissatisfaction with the pace of talking about joining the EU and Mr. Putin’s move to take advantage of the coolness and gradually break up Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won the positive scores with Ankara for calling for the support of the elected authorities after an attempt at a coup d ' état.
Bear in mind, this is a gift for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of a change of regime.
So, the summit in this shiny palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to picture what one analyst described to me as a “allance of bad”: the two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West join forces.
Despite the public display of reconciliation, however, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing sides.
It may be for itself that after almost three hours of initial talks, while the two Presidents have given a press conference, they have not even touched on the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common ground in Syria.
But after months of open hostility – and given the possibility of a complete catastrophe when a member of NATO was hit by a Russian jet fighter – it is better for the two leaders to at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear to clients outside Scotland.
Brand RBS should be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear to clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has retreated from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and needed to be saved.
During this period, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other brands of consumer credit.
He was supported by millions of pounds of international sports support, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to the Wimmerdon Andy Murray Champion.
But it has now been decided that it is right to let more national brands get to the top.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scotland's clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will have a greater impact - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview on a tour of clients and employees in Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland, "Brend RBS will eventually be our investment brand and the one that our staff will be engaged in, because we are now becoming more a brand bank."
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I'm saying we don't have global aspirations anymore, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something very different in its own population groups, and our staff will work with clients under those brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor the six-nation Cup, and it is building a profile of different brands in sports.
"This is the right time for us to move a brand bank, because the basis (we've been asking ourselves) is how we focus on improving a bank for customers?" said the Executive Director.
It'd be very cynical three years ago if we said we were gonna be a great bank for clients and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we've been doing, focusing on the needs of our clients, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can get those brands back, so I think it's a good time.
Franky Dettory is up to 3000 victors in New Market in The Obstacles.
Dettori sprinkles the champagne after the take in New Market brings it to 3,000 wins.
Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3000th British victory in New Market on Friday.
He came to this remarkable mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track - on the Jon State-trained Priesthood.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who has reached this outstanding mark in smooth leaps.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Iddie, and Willie Carson.
Three-time jockey champion Dettory, who had previously won at the Ghyar, said, "This is something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I'm very glad it happened in New Market, because this is where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big social event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's just a Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free of business and very unattractive.
Detectors take a round of applause when it brings predestination after victory.
The two jockeys reached this point in the hurdles: the jockey champ Richard Johnson and the 20-fold retiring champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4,300 wins in a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby Winner, 4493 wins a career
Franky is one of the best jockeys of the modern era, and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark, which so few have ever reached.
It's style and strong, but it's his tactical smartness that separates it from the others in the weighting room.
He's an excellent rep for the race, his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if he hadn't been just a jockey for the weekend and a big leap!
And, seriously, Frankie has been bringing the winners to Britain for most of 30 years, which is good to see.
He's an energetic character, which is good for the British race, but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettory was celebrating this brilliant mark with a brand-new quick leap off the horse.
From the fast end to the fast run, Frankie Dettorey has been a symbol of the British smooth leap for two decades.
It was ups and downs.
A lot of the winners of the big leaps, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was disqualified due to doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after a six-month disqualification, but he showed a great deal of will to challenge skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished for a while, and Dettory earlier said he wanted to continue to compete at least until he was 50 years old.
Putin fires the Chief of Staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Russian President Wladimir Putin has suddenly fired his head of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trust circle for many years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed a representative for the environment and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin “determined to release Ivanov from his responsibilities as head of the Russian administration of the President,” but did not give a reason.
Mr. Ivanov, Anton Wyno, has been appointed his successor since 2012.
Mr. Wyno, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he was the head of the Office of the President's Protocol and the Government's Office, and he reports to the Kremlin's website (in Russian).
At the time of his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your work as head of State in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are being followed up.
Putin told a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked for his release from office and recommended that Wyno replace him.
Do Smile Convince?
This is a move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest supporters of Vladimir Putin and, like him, served in the Soviet Security Service, the KGB.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on State TV, both men stated that the head of the administration had resigned on his own will.
But despite the smiles on the camera, there's not a lot of people here, especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, this is the unforeseeable consequence of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement, that a man who was once agitated as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy, was met with a massive scepticism.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to trust me with this very difficult position, even a problem post, for four years.
Well, it turns out I was the head of the president's office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSS), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
Ivanov was once thought to be a Russian president after Putin’s second term, as Putin’s third term would run counter to the constitution.
But this post was occupied by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister until his return to the presidency after just three and a half years.
The star of "Think Like a Criminal" by Thomas Gibson is fired after a fight with a producer.
Gibson was a part of a show fight in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC Studios and the CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, have announced his dismissal in a joint application.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday, before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences in the shoots and differences of opinion.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in his statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be erased from a show that follows the FBI's team are expected to be available later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
A 54-year-old actor who used to play a major role in the Dharma and Greg sitcoms was on the show from the first season in 2005.
"I love "thinking like a criminal" and I've put my heart and soul in it for the last 12 years," said Gibson in a statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but now it's not gonna be possible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our great team, and, most of all, the best fans the show ever dreamed of.
The show is scheduled to return with its 12th season on September 28.
Mystery: The fish landed in the garden of Banfa
A man from Banfa applied for help in the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bane thinks 75 fish might have been sandstones left behind by a water tornado.
Bane, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted a picture of this spectacle in Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
The Bridge is now connected to Fife.
The £1.35 billion project now has to be completed by May 2017.
The engineers combined the North Flight and the Quinsferry Crossing Viadic, which means that the Bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four links between the "vegets of the canvas" that are now nearing the end of all three pilons of the bridge.
The Fife Bridge section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 vants of bridge.
The £1.35 billion project now has to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economics, Kit Brown, visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnesses to the engineering art of a really epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete have been used to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the end of the link between the Viaduk and the Bridge is a virtual operation using very precise assembly tolerances.
A total of about 79% of the entire bridge is now in place, and for the last section of the linen, concrete is poured out in Rosté today, which means that all of the canvas is ready to go up on the bridge.
Michael Martin, the director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said, "The first link on every bridge project is always a milestone.
In this stunning project, this connection is the most modern building art.
After installing the last section of the roadwork and linking it to the expanding North Pilon roadwork, we were left to close the remaining gap on the North side, or the side to the shore.
This was done by pulling up the viaduk of the northern approach 700 millimeter south.
It was a massive and, at the same time, very elegant operation.
It's massive, because it's 222 meters long, it weighs about 6,000 tons, and it's supposed to be up to about 3%.
Fine, because the tolerances the team was working on were tiny -- just a few millimeters in each direction.
Luckily, all of this went very well.
Salvation in the Bay of Moelfre: Three men's luck to stay alive
The three men "have been lucky to stay alive" after they were thrown off a fishing boat in England.
The Moelfrey RNLI rescue station raised an alarm at 1:20 a.m. British summer time on Friday, after the team saw an incident unfolding in the Bay of Moelfr.
Three men tried hard to get to a safe place, while their ship continued to move.
"We saw their ship spinning next to them and imagined the worst," said the wheelboat of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happily, by the time we got down on the water, a strong wind took it away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man, aged 60, was found tired and clinging to a buoy without a lifejacket.
All of them were boarded by a shore lifeboat and taken to a rescue station.
Jones said, "Three men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely intact.
The engine of the boat had an emergency entrepreneur, but it somehow shook off the man who was running the boat when it rolled over.
Someone's been protecting these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It's exciting to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time watching screens, has been a grudge to many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go separates people from the sofa and engages in some physical activity.
The time in the screen was initially limited to TV, video games, and, more recently, smartphones.
It's so good to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the complete fascination, which is Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (the result was a series of cartoons, playcards, and other branches).
Like many other pop-cultural events, all of this was overtaken by the time this new game was made available in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed at the time due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In the next few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In short, the smartphone player is looking for the Pokemons, who are tracked by GPS and, if found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on your phone) or "captured".
The generation that played the game as a younger generation joined the prodigy, getting off the search sofas.
In the U.S., the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by a normal man on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which trackes 35,000 users, recently reported that within two days of the start of the game, the number of people tracked by them, who performed 30-minute daily exercises, rose from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the basic level data.
Many health-care campaigns that convince people to "find 30 minutes," "get off the sofa" and "be active every day" have not been reciprocated, because most health messages are boring and are spoken out by people who look miserable.
The importance of exercise, however, cannot be overstated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity can help with weight fixing, high arterial pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it brings people out to do what they love.
So there are three basic health features: motion, fresh air, and sunlight, and joy.
Some people even make new friends on a hunt.
As usual, there are boring nerds who are looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might run into the door.
So what?
There's been a break-in.
After all, even though smartphone apps, such as Fitbit, might have been able to track our physical activity before, they didn't give us a reason to go to school, as this game does.
The news is on the table, and the use will weaken over time.
But because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good shape, and healthy.

Simone Bayles wins absolute gold in female gymnastics.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the mess.
Simone Bayles is invincible for all of this.
Dynamic on the back-up.
Unenforced on a log.
stunning on the floor.
Fascinating everywhere.
And now, at last, the Olympic Champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast went up to the title of absolute champion on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on a persuasive demonstration under close Olympic attention.
Her total score was 62.198 from the silver medalist and teammate Eli Reisman and the Russian bronze medalist Alija Mustafina.
Bayles, from the United States, is playing at the Gymnastic Tree during the Final Finals of the Women's Absolute Primary Arts at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bayles became the fourth in a row an American woman to win the title of absolute top and fifth in general, building her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps ever.
She wept when her final total score was shown, and her long journey to this point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as the very rare athletics, such as Michael Phelps, who raised their sports to new heights:
Byles has spent the last three years dominant in her sport, winning 15 medals at the World Cup, including 10 gold medals, with such staggering programs in their mix of hard work and accuracy, that the 1984 Olympic Champion Mary Lou Retton called it "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test was in Brazil, a competition not so much between Bayles and the others in this field, but between her and the cargo of high expectations.
Anything less than going back to my family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be viewed as an unfulfilled expectation.
Simone Bayles from the United States, on the left, and Eli Reisman are hugged after winning gold and silver, respectively, in the Finals of the Women's Absolute Primary Arts at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Byles earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for a retiring Martha Karoli national team coordinator.
While Bayles insisted that she never looked in the future on her long way to the top, it's not quite true.
Part of her free exercise program, one that includes her branded pass, is set up on Latin music, which would go right outside of the Rio Olympics.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparent, as a young man and an open-ended mother of Coach Aimee Burman during her visit to the hall where Burman was a trainer, became a force.
She hasn't lost a single full-time competition since the summer of 2013, a track of luck that should last as long as Bayles wants.
Although Mustafina gained a small advantage with two spins, it was a mirage.
The hymn log and the free exercise, where Bayles defends the title of the world's champion, are in an ambush.
She again went forward with 15.433 on the log and finished with 15.933 on the floor.
Reisman hugged her gently while they were waiting for the final bill -- a pure formality -- and the tears appeared around a brilliant red and white eyeliner for the eyes of Bayles, when the design she once recorded in the clipping album came to an end.
Reisman's presentation was a small revenge for what happened four years ago, when she shared third place, but lost Mustafina's bronze on the tai-bread.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of a team that Americans call "Grandma" was far ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise covered by the return, which sometimes seemed in question.
As for Bayles, a 19-year-old viral tweet from the beginning of this week now has a very new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in the serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl, who died in the most deadly attack in the first generation of Phoenix's killer in the last decade, sat in the car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Alice's daughter, Malia, were shot dead on June 12, when their car was parked on the street, and the authorities announced.
The perpetrator fired about eight shots from a gun on the passenger side of the car, after which he ran off on another vehicle, and was reported.
The police claim that the three-way murder does not seem to be the result of the robbery, as the intruder has not taken the wallet or the $2,900 that was at the disposal of an adult victim.
The Phoenix Police Agent, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, stated that the shooting prompted the investigators to see if he was involved in the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas for four months.
"This is happening in a residential area in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, a branch of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW in the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence, which led them to conclude that the attacks were linked to one another and were committed by the same killer.
Alice, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Alice's daughter, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also issued a report to the police on the shelling, the aim of which was an empty pick-up half an hour before the three-year murder, and which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found casings and recovered the bullet from the seat and the fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old child with a microcephalus: "It's getting better."
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto likes to sing, toys, and, of course, his mom.
But unlike most of her peers, Edmund has microcephalus as a result of a genetic disorder that his mom, Elizabeth Pixivto, did not know during her pregnancy.
When he first got home, my first thought was, I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for it.
Which, in fact, is not true -- of course, you're signing up for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized hospital.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing this," Pixivto explained.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he's still not talking.
But it's slowly going through some of the steps.
He walks with extraneous help and rides a bike.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth's showing the gesture Edmund made for "please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," said Pixivto CBS News.
But not just the usual sign language, she says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephalus can result from a number of different factors: genetics, such as in Edmund, infections during pregnancy from such viruses as measles and Zeke.
Symptoms and forecasts may differ significantly.
It is too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zeke virus.
Piksivto remembers emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
Did I keep telling you what was gonna happen?
What's gonna happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifetime prognosis, because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Pixivto has an encouraging advice for the mothers of children with congenital defects due to Zeke.
It's getting better.
You know everything's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
The heavy rain, the flood, is the reason for the rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi.
The heavy rain and massive flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state by Saturday.
Numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and south of Mississippi have come out of the shores and threaten massive flooding after extreme rainfall, reported the National Meteorological Service.
The Governor of Louisiana, John Bell Edwards, said that government officials were in constant contact with local authorities, and the aid had already been sent to the parishes.
Mike Steele, the Governor's Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, stated that there were requests for high water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said it was only the parish of Tanjipahoa that asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The risk of flooding remains until Saturday in much of the south of Louisiana.
The weather office said in the statement that an extra 3 to 5 inches might sink to the area.
In Southern Alabama, the waiting period for the flood was until Friday, as it continued to rain in the Mobil area.
The Comite River next to Baton Rouge, and the Amit River next to Denem Springs, both in Louisiana, are expected to set a record for last weekend.
Sinoptic Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could have flooded a lot of houses in the suburbs near Baton Ruj.
He also said that a flood going down the stream in the Assensen parish was a threat, as these swelling rivers would flow slowly into Lake Morpa.
The Ticfo River, just south of Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, has reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday.
Squads still got people out of the flooding in Amit and Wilkinson County in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stiefson were among the rescued early on Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says that the water of Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose fast overnight.
He said that the other stepson, who lived in the neighborhood, had warned him.
"We woke up, and the water continued to come," Hansford said.
She's reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford it was the biggest inundation she'd ever seen in 48 years who lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family had a disability, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers saved all three with an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Crowtmann says that the flood is “promptly spreading,” as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an order to evacuate.
Crowtmann says an observer outside Livingstone reported a 13.775 inch of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Crowtmann said the soil was overfilled with rain from the environment.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets have led to the work of rescuing the people from their homes in the parish of Tanjipahoa and the abolition of classes in five school districts, the authorities state.
WWL, a CBS branch office, reports that Tanjipahoa's counselor spoke about 200 flooded homes.
The residents have been evacuated to two churches, but both are now sinking.
The president of the parish, Robbie Miller, said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets in high water.
The shelters were opened in the city of Amit and Hammond to receive those who had been evacuated.
"They will be able to go home as soon as the water begins to retreat," he said.
In the city of Hammond, the parish of Tanjipahoa, about two dozen streets, were closed due to a high water level, and sandbags were available for distribution to the population in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said the city manager Lacey Landrum.
This is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Management Service, Rupert Lacey, reported that it was still raining off the Gulf of Mexico.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, manager of the Shopper Value Funds store in Amit, has been in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," said Tauson, "and it's still on the ground."
Mahage Brown, 6, "cut off by bullets," is still alive after the shooting in Philadelphia.
The police report that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, registering a second shot at a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The grandparent of the child identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
Grandma and grandpa say Brown was hit by multiple gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He's been hit hard, his little body was shattered with bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melendez at the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in the hospital in critical condition and has been through a number of operations.
The family told the station he was gonna be okay.
He was supposed to go to the first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Jermantown quarter.
Three men, two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old, were also shot.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; two other victims have been registered in a stable state, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The baby was found shot in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting to the station.
The other two were out of the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been shot.
Investigators report to the CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been an exchange of fire between several armed men.
Semi-automatic casings, which are attributed to different copies of semi-automatic weapons, have swept the scene.
Seems like it was definitely a long fight.
There were casings on the street, on both sides of the side of the sidewalk.
So it appears that there were a number of armed men and they were actively involved in the shooting,” reported the captain of the Philadelphia Police Force, Anthony Gnaldi.
Many homes and cars in this zone have also been hit.
No arrests have been made, and the police are reportedly looking at the CCTV.
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in the arm with a shotgun on Tuesday, when he played in front of his home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby, and Lori
That's what I call this year's women's gymnastics team for a number of reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly, three gymnasts, Simone Bayles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Lori" Hernandez, are playing a key role in this team, which has already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Eli Reisman, who is a Jew, and Madison Koshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
This also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this sport.
For the last four years, African-American female gymnast number one has been an American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
It's powerful.
At Gabby Douglas's last Olympics, she was an unexpected Olympic champ, and America applauded.
The world could now have witnessed the incredibly three-time world champion Simone Bayles, Douglas, and Lori Hernández performing unexpected but still virtual gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win the gold in the individual absolute first place.
And Ali Reisman's teammate got the silver.
We're witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn't look like this in gymnasiums all over the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Lori all took the same path as Ali and Madison to form the Olympics.
They're the Final Five, because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts on the team, and this is Martha Caroli's last year of coaching.
But in fact, gymnastics are expensive sports, and gymnasts are first trained in private gymnasium clubs supported by their parents, which pay for the cost of schooling, equipment, travel, uniforms, fees for competitions, hotels (for coaches and their gymnasiums and families) and the list is still on.
Most of these gymnasium clubs are located in rich suburbs that can support this business.
These clubs are where the gymnasts get everything from their training, and it's a dear and long-term obligation for the gymnasium family.
Aimee Burman, a trainer for Simone Bayles, and Maggie Hani, a trainer for Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes from the moment they started gymnastics.
We need to create more affordable and accessible gymnastics for countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnasium fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 urban youths (mainly blacks and Latin Americans) and raised national and international champs.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my hometown, to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Hymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resilience to debilitating work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a life-long positive effect on good health, school and work.
It's the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Sport is so important, especially for girls.
This is such a great time.
Thank you, Simone, Eli, Lori, Gabby, and Madison for this serious show of the "Women's Power" win-off Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of all backgrounds to be healthy, strong, and successful young women.
The younger doctors have taken up the announcement of further strikes after the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's offer.
The Ministers hoped to complete the change dispute by agreeing to a modified agreement with the British Medical Association ' s leaders, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to implement the treaty, saying that NHS was on no land, and any subsequent delay would harm the staff and patients.
The first junior physicians have been translated into a new contract, which includes changes to work at night and weekends to improve out-of-school services.
Dr. Ellen McCott, Chairman of the Young Doctors' Committee, BMA, said last night in a statement, "The junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will feed on the existing labour crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors in a fair manner."
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors are reassigned, progress is needed and time is running out.
The VMA ' s attempt to resolve the dispute in the negotiations was met by a reluctance to take action and, at times, a complete silence on the part of the Government.
And that despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, to inspire the introduction, and to respond to the concerns of the junior doctors.
If he does not do so, then the youngest doctors are certain that they are ready to organize a follow-up strike.
The last strike in late April resulted in some 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nursing visits, while the nurses and consultants were engaged to secure the replacement of doctors on the picket line.
The ministers hoped to end the change dispute by agreeing to a modified agreement with the British Medical Association.
IMA wants to pay a better vacation for 54,000 junior doctors who will fall within the scope of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the CEO of NHS Employers, urged the paramedics not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said, "Strike does not reach much or nothing, but puts pressure on those who are already working at the limit of commands and services, and causes anxiety, physical pain and disorders to patients, caretakers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have been talking to the Committee of the Young Doctors and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of caretakers and corporate information policies.
It was hoped that the continued positive assistance on other important topics — such as the distribution of staff, flexible learning, extra training for those who return after a career break, the cost of learning, the mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender-based wage differentials in medicine — was a sign of how serious the employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about to meet the conditions that the WMA had achieved in November, February and May.
A 2-per-day drug can reduce the risk of a heart attack.
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to use a £2 a day after the authorities have recommended to give it to more people for a longer time.
The anti-rotation drug ticgrilore reduces the risk of relapses for people with cardiac diseases.
The drug is already scheduled for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The NICE Service of the National Health Service of the United Kingdom recommended that it be given to people for four years in order to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, NICE’s National Health Service has advised people to give it to them for four years in order to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs every year in about 140,000 people in England, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes result from the accumulation of fat on the walls of the arteries and the formation of placards.
If a plaque is torn apart, it can cause a clot that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can move through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already been hit by one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
The astraZeneca, a British company that sells as Brilique, reduces the risk by making the clots less likely.
The NICE draft instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 milligrams of ticgrilor for 12 months, then 60 milligrams of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Center, said, "Despite the existence of effective secondary prevention with about a quarter of the people who have already had a heart attack, there is another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetitiveness can have a significant negative effect on the quality of life.
There is evidence that aspirin combined with tikgril is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
By pre-advising ticgril, we are happy to be able to expand the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who are ready to use it.
Since information on the efficiency and safety of tikgrlor, especially the risk of bleeding, is limited at the end of three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment longer than that period.
The culture of PC ownership allows for the falsification of votes in Muslim regions to flourish
The ex-mayor of the Tower-Hamlets Lutfour Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption, serving as a trigger for the Government's report.
The culture of political correctness has led to blindfolding, which has led to the universal falsification of votes in Muslim communities, according to information from the destructive government report that has been made public today.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former Cabinet Minister, has been critiqued by the police, election monitors and city administrations for ignoring evidence of electoral irregularities due to “excessive sensitivity to race and religion”.
The former secretary of the local communities, now the anti-corruption king, reported that the intimidation of religiously motivated voters was so strong that the police needed to be allowed to place borderlines outside the polls to protect the fearful voters.
He proposes that the voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
For the time being, the electors should just give their name and address.
The report even suggests that ink should be applied to the fingers of the people when they pass their ballots, so as to delete so that someone can vote twice.
There is a need to give better protection to whistle-blowers, Sir Eric said.
It calls for greater press access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This is done not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the current Mayor of Luftur Rahman should have been removed from office for a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rachman “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, blaming them for racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, as he was said, “went his campaign on the basis that it was the Muslim faith's duty to vote for it”.
Up to 300 votes were doubtful or the result of a person voting, pretending to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He raised particular concerns about mail fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community were reported to have put pressure on people to vote for their choice.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations to clean up the voting system, including the requirement to bring his identity card to prove who you are.
His report states: “Provided evidence of the pressure placed on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote at the will of the elders, especially in the communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"There was a fear that ... public institutions had closed their eyes to such behaviour due to the overly sensitive “political correctness” of ethnicity and religion."
Sire Erik made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the suspension of political activists from working with the postal ballots to stop the "vote harvest."
The report under consideration by Theresa May also calls for stricter registration checks to prevent the use of the voter list for fraud with immigration and privileges.
The option of requiring voters to submit an identity card before voting is under consideration.
Use ink on people's toes as soon as they drop their ballot to stop anyone from voting twice.
Carry out systematic checks on the nationality of people to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.
Discontinue political campaigners and activists from working with completed absentee ballots and postal envelopes.
To give the police the authority to set up borderlines around the polling stations.
Modify the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidating under the 1983 People ' s Act.
Make it illegal to take a picture at the polling station.
Require that only English be used at polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Increased training to ensure that the staff forces the voters to go to the booth one by one.
Sir Eric is aggressively attacking the city's police, saying it's "surprising" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of acts of corruption and illegality," he reported.
He was found guilty in the absence of a reasonable doubt, the criminal standard of proof, on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the inconclusive “check-outs” of the city administrations’ electoral offices.
Sir Eric stated, "The previous court order in the Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacies as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the worrisome and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some organs threaten this good reputation.
Crazy by the bicyclic analogy of Kate and other celebrities of the Rio Olympics
The fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy about the French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Pevo, who has turned out to be an impressive type of Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old player in the Olympics is far from the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who can brag about her own famous doppelganger, at least according to social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrity faces on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has drawn up a list of Olympics with more than a surface resemblance to the Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: Member of the U.S. male archer team, Brady Allison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid.
In addition to Kate's bicycling doppelganger, a lot of people on the Internet hastened to point out how a certain archer could be the twin superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the U.S. male archer's team, Brady Allison, caused a hurricane on Twitter after the images of it, which looked frighteningly like a Wall Street Wolf star.
And in fact, the archer found out about the madness of social media and admitted he'd heard he'd been like Leo ever since he was a kid.
"I don't personally see a massive resemblance, maybe with the exception of the vegetation on the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will no doubt point even more this year: the striking resemblance between British jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Alia Mustafina, with her big, clear-eyed eyes, is said to be an exact copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burga, Matthew Morrison has been compared to the star of Glee Club for many years.
Going to the more unexpected: This user thinks that Nathan is the "sport version" of the "Start" actor.
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Raphael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who can brag about the same heavy eyebrows and lips.
A silver medieval swimmer from Russia, Julius Efimov, can show off not only tanned skin and blonde hair like the actress Anna Lynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian of the United States team, according to fans, is like "the sporting version of Joseph Gorgon Levitte."
Worse women: A football star, Hope Solo, on the left, and an actress, Jennifer Carpenter, from Dexter, on the right, have the same shapes of face and eye
Not the only one: one Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities.
By creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of this couple.
A Twitter user recently called the site to make public his admiration that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually the same."
In fact, the star of United States football and actress Dexter have incredibly similar face-and-eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of the actress Laura Lynnie, and the gold medalist Gabby Douglas, who can brag at her own beautiful, wide smile, which is like the star's smile, "Be successful," Gabrielle Union.
A commentator at the CBC is apologizing for saying "dead like a pig" about a Chinese swimmer.
Analysing Byron McDonald number four at the end of the 14-year-old Ay Yanhan on a 4x200-m free-style women's estuarium, aroused CBC viewers in a live show of the Olympics.
CBC Canada was forced to apologise after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started like a stench" and "dead as a pig" during the swim.
Commenter Byron McDonald thought his mic was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the 4x200 m final women's relay.
You could hear McDonald, who was drawn to the CBC commentators' team to "smart it in color," say, "This 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Too excited, started like a stench, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ay Yanhan, 14-year-old, swam through the second phase of the 1 :57.79, a slower time than Canadian Taylor Rake, by allowing the Canadians to clear the gap from China.
The viewers all over Canada reacted quickly online after they were shaken by the tone and the language used.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC spree just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig?"?
This idiot didn't know they were still on the air."
About Ay Yanhan from China at the end of the 4x200 m women's relay style, they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Twitter critique hit Byron McDonald right away, with a lot of people calling for his release.
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Oh, wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us look like a bunch of racists. #disguised.
Shortly after, Scott Russell, who was running a CBC program, apologised live for McDonald's comment, saying, "We're asking for forgiveness for the comment on a swim talk on the air."
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
The SAF ended up apologizing to over 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement.
A friend of the commentator, Scott Russell, had to make an apology on behalf of McDonald.
CBC then copied and sent their apology to over 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments.
The network also hastened to apologise and publish the application.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to air.
Last night, we acted fast to apologise to our viewers live and to our social media followers.
Let's be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not about her as a person.
Still, it was an inappropriate and bad choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying he didn't think his words would be interpreted as an attack on a person.
"I'd like to take this moment to apologise for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said on the CBC Olympics.
'I was talking about a swimmer, not her.'
'It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I'm so sorry.'
The buyer of Primark offended a woman who shyly put on her underwear in the middle of the shop.
Buyers didn't know where to look when some woman was naked to try on her panties, on the floor with the shops in the middle of Primark.
Worse still, she tried on how she looked in them, pulled them off, and put them back on the shelve.
She continued her search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear at the Bowery Place shopping center in Falkland.
The Prymark shopping center of the Bowery Place in Falkland, where a woman used tricotting panties before putting them back on the shelves
The mother of the two kids, Jenny Davidson, who was at the shop at the time, said that after the underwear was put on, the mystery woman again "dressed and left the shop without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the mall, she took a pair of panties out of the window, undressed her own panties and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a private place to do it -- she just stood there, shameless."
"Everybody was staring when she took off her panties again, "and she clearly didn't like them, "because she put them back on the shelve."
She did the same thing to the other three couples before she finally decided that there was nothing here that she liked to dress up and go out again.
"It didn't seem like she cared who was watching her, "or what she thought about the man who would eventually buy the panties she was trying on."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson, from Kent, said, "It's a shame to think someone's gonna take home the panties that someone else was wearing, and they weren't washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I think the staff was probably trying to get these things out of the market after she left -- and the better. "
"I don't want to come home with a new pair of women's underwear and find out what the other woman was wearing and taking them off, and they weren't washed."
A representative of Primark said, "Primark is aware of an incident that happened at our shop in Falkland on Tuesday, August 9.
All the items in question have been removed from the market.
How to protect yourself from attack with a gun using a craw-mage
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Ron Misrachi, the master of the Federation of Krav Magic in New York, to find out how to deal with the armed robbers at close range.
Whether you go from the front or the back, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own gun.
If they come from behind, according to Misrachi, the first thing you need to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and "free the line of fire."
Then you tighten the gun between your forearm and shoulder before you hit them in the face with a free elbow.
Then you follow the knee in the groin, and as the attacker bends off the pain, you twist the gun out of his hand, hit it in the face with a gun, and go back with the gun pointed at it.
For an armed from the front, it's like getting your body off the line of fire, grab the gun fast and twist it so the villain can't fire.
At the same time, move the weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then turn the gun out of his grab, before you go back and aim at it.
Does it sound complicated?
Look at the video to see how Misrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery -- if you're not a Master Krav Maga -- is to give up your cash.
For a guide, a traveler, Jan Wright, spends his language in the most filthy places in Europe.
The British traveller put his immune system and vomiting reflex to a serious test, licking some of the most filthy and abhorrent places in Europe.
The host and author of the travel books, Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, spent his language on the euro banknote, the Circus Piccadili rails, the toilet wash button on the train, and a Russian public phone to prove the power of his immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is supposed to be a movie called "Lisoon Traveler's Guide to the Inner Power," has had some amazing results.
The idea of licking the washing button on a train used by thousands of others can be extremely repugnant, but in fact there are worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and health-care providers about the increase in intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, none of the licked has given him any more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for his intestinal test, traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public railing at the train station to the toilet wash button, this task has no doubt experienced his immune system.
In the movie he was filming, he said, "Since I was a kid, I was completely careless about my health, and I pulled a lot of things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirt water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test swab showed a luminometer of more than 4,000 units.
By comparison, just washed hands have to be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet, which he refused to lick after the value of his luminometer was more than 4,000, while the newly washed hands show less than 60
Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio made a movie on a traveler titled "Trainer-Lizoon's Guide to the Inner Power", which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the toilet.
In the movie, he said, "This is close to one of the worst things I've ever sniffed in the toilet."
There's nothing more filthy than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything 'cause it's disgusting.
The "Lisoon Traveler's Guide to the Inner Power" was taken with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains acidic bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestinal bacteria and to develop the immune system.
Senior Vice-President Valio for snacks, juices, and new categories, Nico Wuorenmaa, said, "We really wanted to offer the consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see, and at the same time might explain the value of the proriotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended up with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They say the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a more context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health, and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we have been able to give the users more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the film's director, added, "Let's say I'd lose my respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the movie."
Of course, some of Jan's things were easier to lick, and some of them were pretty hard.
I'm glad we've been able to film some of these licks.'
In a 2015 poll, Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents associated acidic bacteria with a very good stomach and intestinal state, while 58 per cent said that they used at least occasionally products containing added acidic bacteria.
The family of bullies destroyed Saltash, the city house of Cornwall, on the evicted day.
A family of bullies left their municipal home with a loss of £50,000 after being evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilcock, were kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the real property, the shocking officials of the housing and construction cooperatives found the real property in a state that needed to be renovated.
The walls were left with shining holes, the floors were opened, the trash was scattered on the floor, and the walls were filthed with graffiti.
The family is now resettled and is supposed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McAvoy, a landlord at Cornwall Houseing, said she was afraid he couldn't be saved.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are a lot of things that need to be weighed out, because this property is likely to be known as not a very good Cornwall aspect.
This family enjoys bad fame, and their name enjoys bad fame.
A couple of three sons, who lived in a real estate facility from time to time, and the police report that the kingdom of the terror caused by the family included bat-and-ball fighting on the street, intimidating the people in the surrounding areas, drug use, drug trafficking, overreacting cries, disputes and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got a warrant for anti-social behavior in June.
In a number of rooms at the house, which might be made, they found the old trash.
The floorboards in a house that used to sell drugs have been pulled off.
Neighbors say they saw a street fight and called the police on a regular basis.
Cornwall Houseing forcibly evicted her and her partner this week, after having been granted an extended period of 11 weeks to leave voluntarily.
Eviction was a relief to the neighbors, who said that their lives had been turned into hell.
One said, "They didn't care."
We've been with them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
'This morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet - we're not used to it!
Now that they've finally left, it's gonna be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of Cornwall Houseing, said that the family was unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and regularly called the police
The trash and the old toys have been scattered down the green side of the city's house.
He added, "It's a shame that the tenant couldn't take any responsibility for her and her family's behavior, because evicting is always the last method to be considered by Cornwall Houseing.
This was a very complex case, as the behavior was limitable, and their actions must have been horrifying to her observant neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police, and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done to give us information.
I hope that this development will give a bit of comfort to the neighbours and send a message that social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three of his sons lived in the house at different times, but he said they were all a little over 20.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to clean up the piles of trash that surrounds the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of pottery, as well as weights, supplies and £1700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after he pleaded guilty to possessing Class B drugs for delivery.
She claimed that the money was for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After making them homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the house's rooms have been tainted with graffiti all over the surface.
The police say they're gonna try to evict tenants who don't follow the lease rules.
Angela Crowe, from Devon and Cornwall PD, said that the eviction sent a clear message to other tenants who continued to break the rules.
'This is a message to those who feel that they can behave without the charge of the prosecutor, as well as to those who are harmed by such conduct,' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be tolerated by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
The tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane almost hit the beach.
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to be shining in the sun were horrified for their lives.
The P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force reported that he was on a training flight, but insisted on no security risk
This is a moment when fearful tourists start to panic, while the moment when a low-flying plane sprang over an overcrowded beach.
Dramatic images show a military jet about a distance from the hunters on a sand strip to Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The resters leaped on their feet as soon as they became comprehensiblely concerned with the noise of the aircraft's engines, but were not able to see what was moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident took place last night near the city of Aveira in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of a few vacationers who posted a video of a shocking social media overrun, said, "He flew very low twice, and there was a moment, at some point it seemed to break."
Nono Arroga added, "I was surfing and I swear, it was like a plane was about to fall on me."
Tourists on Aveira Beach were horrified when the plane appeared out of the mist and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to locate fishing boats off the shore, and was forced to sink so low, as it was the only way to test them.
The pilot stated that the flight was a bit lower than usual due to a lack of visibility due to smoke from nearby burning forests, but the Air Force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal and claimed the lives of four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force today made a statement that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances of the dense mist and the smog from the forest fires, which made the appearance worse.
The plane was on a training flight, and the pilot was assigned to locate fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HASSP system has been compulsory for over a year, but most of the restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Checks are getting more and more, and the business faces fines of up to 1 million roubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system (HACCP, in the Russian version of HACCP) - risk analysis and critical control points - is mandatory for the use of food by producers and transporters, as well as for the Russian General Service, as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
The business of Rostlynadzor to meet these standards in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But, for the time being, the officials only issue fines for individual violations of the rules (see “List of documents ...”).
A total of 600,000 roubles for the first offence and 1 million roubles for the second would be for failure to implement the regulations.
The HASSP, as a system that takes into account and prevents food risks, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about the safety of food for the astronauts.
The system is now being used in all food plants, not just in the United States, but in Canada and the European Union.
Since February 2015, HACSP has been operating on the TS.
Business was four years old for the design and implementation of the system (the HASSP requirement was introduced in the TC system in 2011).
Both businessmen and officials, however, recognize that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
We, unfortunately, have long been convinced that the norm is about food production and not about retortorts, as explained by the head of the Public Council, Helena Cereteli.
Now everyone's trying to catch up.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is the end of August and the beginning of September.
But they won't call for a big demand, because their target audience - families with children - is already getting ready for school, and experts say.
The Alliance of Tourism Agencies sent a letter to the Government yesterday asking for a charter right now.
“For many Russian tourists, the question of the selection of quality and accessible seafaring is insurmountable, as most of the sites in the resorts of Krasnodarsk and the Republic of Crimea have been booked by the end of September,” the authors of the letter state, and stress that the opening of chartered transport in August will not have a significant effect on the demand for Russian seafood.
According to the Northwest Regional Office of the Russian Union of the Touring Industry (RTU), in the event that the air administrations of Russia and Turkey agree quickly, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding, when the charters are relaunched, until now, depends first and foremost on the aviation authorities.
Technically, the planes can fly in September, even in August, if the tower operators are quick to set up programmes and to make arrangements with the airlines on the sidelines,” says Pavel Rumentsev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the Northwest Regional Office of the RST.
According to him, a possible renewal of the charters is good news, but it's not going to have a lot to do with market power, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already come back from vacations and are preparing for school or on vacations in other countries.
In the velvet season, tours are bought mostly by single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontanely,” says Pavel Rumentsev.
"Turkish has a chance to attract a lot of tourists, if it's now going to give a very budget offer -- 50-60,000 roubles per tour for two, because there are people who are looking forward to very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, Director General of Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, there's no way to count on a big deal - the bulk of the trips are already planned.
Paul Rumentsev also believes that, since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, the charters will also be needed, but there is no reason to wait.
"For Turkey, the launch of the charters now is the next season's rehearsal," says Pavel Rumentsev.
"Opening the charters to Turkey - positive news for the next season," Valeria Rubtsov agreed.
The tax code provides for the exemption from the NDFL of statutory compensation payments, within the limits of the approved rules for compensation for harm caused by injury or other health damage.
The award of milk to workers working in harmful working conditions is provided for in article 222 of the Criminal Code.
On the other hand, the rules and conditions for extradition are set out by order of the Ministry of Health and Development of the Russian Federation of 16 February 2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, the free distribution of milk or other equivalent foods is made to workers on days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful production factors in the workplace.
On the basis of the above-mentioned rules, the FNL of the Russian Federation, in the letter under consideration, found that, on the basis of article 217, paragraph 2, of the National Code of Health of the Russian Federation, the income from the cost of milk, which is paid to employees on days of actual employment, in accordance with the Norms and the conditions approved by the Order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of 16 February 2009, No. 45n.
The Moscow Gastrobank has not been licensed by the BC.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked a license to run a bank transaction with a credit organization.
According to the regulator, the ACB AKB GASSTROIBANC has implemented a high-risk credit policy to place money in low-quality assets.
An adequate risk assessment at the request of the supervisory authority and a fair presentation of the value of the bank ' s assets have led to the creation of a basis for the credit organization to implement measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in questionable transit operations.
The bank has a temporary administration until the date of appointment to a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization under federal law have been suspended.
AKB GASSTROYBANK is a member of the deposit insurance system.
Recall that the payment of insurance compensation to bank depositors, including individual entrepreneurs, under Federal Act No. 177-FZ, “On the insurance of the deposits of natural persons in banks of the Russian Federation”, is provided for in the amount of 100 per cent of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million roubles in total per investor.
Payments, according to the Tree Insurance Agency, will begin no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the records, the AKB AKB GUSSTROIBANK's assets as of 1 August 2016 ranked 335th in the Russian Federation's banking system.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIL was killed in Syria
Cadiza Sultan, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, is said to have died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akunji said her family found out about her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, a siege of a group in the country, as ITV News reported on Thursday.
The sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just when she was planning to leave a war-torn country to return to England.
"We can only hope that the only advantage of all of this - like a tombstone and a will to others - is that these are the risks that are at stake in a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making the same choice," said Akunji.
In February 2015, the Sultan and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The sultan family said that she married an ISIL militant in Syria and became a widow for months.
Reid states that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the position of Supreme Justice in the event of an election.
The leader of the Democrats in the senate, Harry Reed, says he is convinced that a democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton will be nominating Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Republicans of the Senate blocked Garland's claim, as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The head of the majority group in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, states that the next president will choose the man who will be able to replace the last Judge of the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia.
Reid announced at the conference call on Thursday that he was predicting that Clinton would pick Garland "with a certain degree of certainty."
Representative Reid later said he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether she was gonna put Garland on the stand, and she was just speculating.
He lauded Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to rock the boat with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid claimed that the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are the "coachs" and "co-workers" of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not the right man for the job.
Treats states that erotic calendars for 'female as well as male'
The journal Treats is working with photographer David Bellmer to release a calendar for 2017, inspired by Pierelli in the 1970s.
But instead of nude celebrities, they aim to find the next generation of top-models for their 2017 calendar with nude music.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy, because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We need to go back to displaying a permanent and classic nude figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," said Shaw in a press release declaring a calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project, because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can serve photographs online or in the open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscow will be given memos about unscrupulous Internet shops.
In Moscow, they're going to issue a memo that will tell us how not to become a victim of an Internet store.
It was reported in Rostpresnadzor, M24.
It has been reported that government officials are preparing a memo that will help citizens to select online shops and identify possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of the brochure includes a number of sections.
This will be the general information and legal framework, the rules on the delivery of goods, the means to protect their legal rights.
The annex will make recommendations on how to make the claim in the right way, and so on,” Rossislavnadzor reported.
The memo is currently being finalized.
It will then be made available on the Rostpresnadzor website in Moscow, and a print version will be published and distributed to Moscow.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia issued a statement in which it named the second suspect in an organization of sabotage in Crimea.
Persons from Ukraine and Russia who have assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts have been detained.
Among them are Panov Evgeny Alexandrowicz and Zachtei Andrej Romanovic.
"Everyone of them gives a confession," the report states.
A resident of the Zaporoz oblast, Yevgeny Panov, who had been detained on suspicion of organizing a terrorist attack in Crimea, had previously pleaded guilty in an interview.
The FAS will fine Google 438 million roubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the Russian Federation (FAS) has ordered an administrative fine of 438 million roubles to Google Corporation, which is on the agency's website.
"The fine for Google for violating the anti-monopoly law was 438 million roubles.
We hope that the company will implement our decision and pay the fine in the near future," said the FAS Deputy Chief, Alexei Dozenko.
In the course of the investigation, the FAS found that Google was supplying smartphone manufacturers that were sold in Russia to a Google Play application store only on the condition that other company applications would be installed on the device.
These applications also include a search system, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation is in breach of article 10, paragraph 1, of the Federal Act on the Protection of Competition (abuse of dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the regulation will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the Russian mobile software market, which will have a positive effect on our consumers.
The Law on the Protection of Competition has to be observed by all companies whose products are supplied to the Russian Federation and transnational corporations, among others,” noted the head of the Department of Communications and Information Technology of the Russian Federation, Helena Zaeva.
The agency suspects 16 Russian shops to conspire.
The New Books Network has been fined to sell the book 50 Days Before My Suicide.
The New Books Network is fined for selling Stace Kramer's book "50 Days Before My Suicide," reports the city news agency "Moscow."
The text of the book may be viewed as “provoking or provoking the suicidal behaviour of children and young people, as reported in Roskilnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine.
The Continent Regional Court confirmed a violation of the requirements for the distribution of information to children and ordered a fine with the confiscation of 49 copies of the printed material seized by the Rosmestnadzor Authority.
The source in the New Bookshop confirmed that it was the work of Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that Moscow's largest bookshops were being tested for the 50 Days Before My Suicide.
There will be a souvenir in Moscow for Ernst the Unknown.
In Moscow, the memory of the sculptor Ernst of the Unknown will take place, reports TASS.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central House of Literaries.
Sadly, not everyone will be able to say good-bye to the Unknown in the United States.
So it was decided to host the evening for those who wanted to remember it in their native land,” the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress declared.
It noted that this was important for the widow of sculptor Anna Graham and his friends all over the world.
Close friends of the Unknown, including the poet Yevgeny Evtouchenko, the artist Boris Messerr, the president of the GMI, Pushkin Irina Antonov, the director of Mark Rosovsky, as well as the Minister of Culture of Russia, Vladimir Medinski, the head of the Moscow Department of Culture, Alexander Kibovsky, and the Deputy Mayor of Moscow, Leonid Printnikov, have been invited to attend the evening.
In the past, it has been reported that the relatives of Ernst the Unknown are planning to hold a sculptor service in New York, allegedly before 14 August.
The end-user blamed: Who actually buys records?
Single middle-aged men like vinyl.
And as long as you don't try to cloak the section of the commentary with rude insults under the pseudonym of the Medieval Men, this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the renaissance of the records is not due to the boom of a generation of 2000s who want to penetrate a new material, but to the nostalgia of the middle-aged.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album with a high probability are between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those in the 18 to 24 age group are the least likely to be.
It's also not just an act of amatery, it's an emotional thing: the older buyers are more likely to hold their feelings (56% as opposed to 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% as opposed to 66%).
But are the YouTube results right?
If this blog was a TV news report, the camera would have been following me while I was walking down the center of a lively Soho street, in a lowly grey suit, and voicing wildly before the stop, voicing my hands and saying something impressive like, "Let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While Soho's heart is slowly losing its charms and dirt — hotels, cafes, shops, the Paperchase are now full of buildings once occupied by independent vendors — a number of music shops with fantastic experts are still in place.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to different people in some of these shops, and I'm trying to measure their age and emotionality with observation.
He is a 55-year-old son of Glasgow Stuart, followed by me from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably over 20), London for a half-day to meet, and he goes shopping for a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask.
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, as shown above (he sent me an e-mail picture, I didn't follow it to the house), line up the walls of his living room.
His reason for getting so many albums and singles is in part from his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn't afford when they just got out, and he can buy the items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of what I'm getting is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, the things that came out when I was 11 or 12, the things for which I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are probably introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink a lot.
That's my drawback.
Wez, 25 years old, who is working at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match the YouTube profile.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people under the influence of media outlets, people who heard about their return and felt the obligation to buy out their old records.
Judging from the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually in about 1998 or 1999.
Clients who once sold their vinyl to buy CD-ROMs are now selling their CD-ROMs to buy out their records," he says.
This may explain the boom among the leaders of the renaissance of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of records?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store, like Phonica, to find out that records shops offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wes, some of the more senior clients, in particular, are offended by the cash-free payment system.
Some vinyl lovers can feel a shock from the digital world and prefer to go to the constants of familiar records envelopes, objects that awaken the memory of a quiet youth.
"I think sometimes it can be a fill of emptiness or possession of material things as a sort of tranquillity," says Wes.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people do, too.
It's a simple way to get your head in.
"We're like their social workers!" a co-worker from the record shelves spoke.
An ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The poll also found that 41% have a player they don't use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl don't have a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I'd probably seem seriously puzzled by gliving a shelve of Bosanova's collections.
The “trofeal” aspect of the renaissance is what Johnny, 42 years of age, has noticed, working at Sounds of the Union (data count: three middle-aged men).
"I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf," he says.
It's not a lot of interest, but it definitely happens.
More of a piece, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not old, they're a little under 20, just getting to know it.
The Fopp, who has now taken almost the entire floor of vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys, and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less inconvenient than in the above-mentioned shops — the last synth and sexy pop Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvision — it is good to see the diversity of its clients.
None of them seem very alone, but it's hard to find a 30-second stay next to someone.
Eleonor, 27 years old, went on Fopp for a few minutes to look at the various records available on the market.
She's looking at the goods, not spending the money.
She doesn't make a lot of money, she says, so it's not a good way to pick up records.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of vinyl is ..." - it dives into dreams with a breath full of love.
I don't know how to explain it -- it's really unique.
My last stop is a shop that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl amateurs: City fashioners.
While I'm creating an illusion that I'm looking at the jean-skin shorts, I'm watching a group of teenage girls, every minute going round a Polaroid cell, before the father and his daughter start talking about the purchase of the Crosley player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall of adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mek, a mix of modern styles and classics, binding records for any medium collection.
No one is watching, perhaps because they are just ornaments, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "guilty vinyl."
But given that any focus on these things can mean more money to the industry and send a few clients to the Soho for a while, there's very little to complain about.
No wonder the segment of the population that is more likely than most people have more time and money than most people do is the one that spends most of the money on luxuries, such as vinyl.
But as long as my findings show that YouTube's results are accurate, at least in Soho records shops, they don't rule out the vast number of female vinyl collectors and fans that exist in reality, in records shops, and online forums.
These people are probably all at school or at the office.
But they clearly don't spend the morning of Thursday, shopping records on Berwick Street, gliving records, and avoiding the look of an unkind 30-year-old fake host who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland Polar Shark — The Longest Livening Vertebrate — Video Report
Scientists claim that a green polar shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, states that the record was set by a female between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
The French court rejects the offer to demolish shops in the jungle refugee camp
The French court rejected the offer of the Kale authorities to demolish dozens of home-made shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At the court hearings this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 home-made shops, where people in the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer a cut, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 p) or simple dishes for a few euro in home-made restaurants.
Prefecture Calais has said that these places must be demolished, because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they bear fire and health risks.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, claiming that free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing number in the camp.
They said that home-made shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille Court held that there was no legal reason to banish the people running 72 homemade shops, but stated that the problems of the Calais prefecture “were fully understood”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that shops, cafes and restaurants played a much more important role than just feeding people who "live in very fragile conditions."
He said that the spaces provided a quiet meeting point for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition was the Children ' s Café Book of the Jungle at the camp, which does not work for profit and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes, and shelter counselling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children’s cafe.
The letter sent to the Guardian stated that its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not over eight years old."
Two charities, aid to the refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday, estimated that the number of people in the jungle camp had increased to more than 9,000, the highest in history, after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.
The neighbourhood libraries invite young freelancers to educational programs.
This week, the philial libraries will meet for City Day, the Year of the Russian Film, and even the Day of the Physician.
The program is focused on the children's audience, so it's going to be more of a game-style program.
Today, August 10th, philial library No. 2, in the linear neighborhood, invites for a cruise presentation, "My Town is Small."
August 11th, at the Library of Philial No. 1 is gonna be the time of the "I live in this city, I know this city."
There will be a multi-media class on the same day at the library-filial No. 2 "Land of the Homeland Past Destiny."
And in the library-filial No. 4 in Sorazjevka, there's a game program called "Film, Film, Film."
On Sunday, August 14th, for the kids from the North Suburb, Philial Library No. 3 will host a game program called "Fiscult-Hello!"
Britain stops at the silver in rugby 7 after Fiji's master class lets them take the gold.
An impressive series of Britain in Regby 7 was stunningly halted at the final block of Fiji's team in the finals on Thursday night, when they were completely crushed at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji was given a master class in ball ownership, dispersal, evasion, support for the game, running lines, and brute power to win gold, their first Olympic medal of any color.
The fall came with not too little consolation in the form of silver, the third of Britain in a day, and they could be proud of their efforts at the first Régby 7 Olympic tournament, in which New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were conquered along the way.
Bock's sick beating, 7-5 in the semifinal earlier the same day, could have come back to have a negative effect on them in the finals.
But, no matter what, Fiji, in this form, won the best of a team of 15.
This may be some consolation for Britain — but probably not — that at least one British man will put a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s Chief Coach, Ben Ryan, the former Chief of England from Wimbledon.
It was a bit of a trip to Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they've only lost one.
These blows will cause pain, but the progress is astonishing.
Fiji has been doing an excellent job for fun by kicking off Britain's attempt to catch the ball.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series Champions went up 5-0 when Ocea Collinisau dived in a corner.
With four minutes on the watch, Gerryr Tuway added another touchdown on the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The brilliant attempt to intercede Mitchell has kept the man, Leon Nakarawa, from slapping a third, but it just slowed Fiji down.
At the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner, and the UK was losing 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the re-entry, and there was still more than a minute on the watch... in the first half.
Watemo Ravovovo then broke through a few more sluggish attempts to intercept Britain and stormed the line to get a point.
The implementation led to a 29-0 break.
It looked like Fiji was born to play rugby 7 while Britain was still mastering the trade.
Which, to a large extent, is the case.
Britain has been making massive replacements for half the game, and they have shut down the Fiji Dam... for all four minutes, which by the first half's standards was good until Joshua Tuisov passed after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton took an attempt for Britain, making a touchdown in the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game was long on the way to the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waving their flags and dancing on the stands.
It was not possible not to admire the full joy of Fiji ' s approach.
Matta William decorated the Fijian cake, which didn't need to be decorated, with another attempt in the last few seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier on the same day, Fiji won Japan 20-5 in its semi-final, and the United Kingdom has outpaced South Africa in a strenuous semi-final one try for everyone, the difference between the British implementation.
Kyle Brown brings Boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some brilliant work of his legs, tore up the line and punched under the beams in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercede from Marcus Watson, a 15-year-old brother to the British team, Anthony, won – and eventually a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the hood of the coach against the cancer.
There will be no more exhilarating gold in these games, and it's about something.
From the first to the last, 220 heavy upturns to history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an added value of their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of Coach Robin Williams was always as long as they wanted the second in a row of Olympic Gold in women's couples, the first women in annals in British sports, who got to such a height.
Their supremacy was absolute, in the end it was their 39th unfailing performance, again unprecedented.
What we see is that two brilliant athletes, slipping on the surface with the elegance of swans, do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind each gold roared a ready-handed battalion, contributing to the incremental victories that are important, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of a trainer who, 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, didn't know if he was gonna live to see the day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had a bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't do it, it goes everywhere.
This could have been a pretty bad situation.
It's a bit of a change in the way you look for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio's lucky he could start the treatment in early 2014 in the inter-season, keeping the break in the schedule minimal, if that might be the right expression in circumstances like this.
I needed to get paid, so I needed to get better fast.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the office -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, even though they said there were enough steps.
That's how it starts.
The eye itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bit more.
The moment after the victory, their first thought was of Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little bit more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own feelings.
Stanning, the captain of an artillery regiment with a service in Afghanistan behind her shoulders, said, "I was an emotional ruin this week, maybe it's a bit too much, but it means so much."
It just proves how much it means to me, how much Helen and I have worked, and Robin, too.
It was fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank you so much, he's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner to train or a better trainer.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose a single race in five years.
This couple is setting a stressful rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even on the last 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark's teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much to spare.
We've been in a lot of a phase.
Helen called out, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
Now it's very important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we didn't try to do something amazing.
We didn't expect fireworks today, we just wanted to be able to get out and win this race, which we did.
It'll take a couple a year to figure out their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, at her own with a TV adventurer, Steve Beckshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I was the Olympic Champion.
It was all so new, and I was so strained.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government has extended the period for the destruction of the sanctions products
The Government has extended until the end of 2017 the period for the destruction of foods prohibited for entry to Russia.
The Order was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on an official legal information portal.
The embargo on countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was imposed in August 2014.
The ban has since been extended on a number of occasions, and is now in force until December 31, 2017.
Russia is not allowed to import some agricultural, raw and food products from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruit and dairy products have been banned.
Recycling of food imported into the country bypassing the embargo has been under way in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products have been removed from the market.
Hunting for "prohibited"
Rains and storms are expected in Moscow on Friday.
There will be an airfront across the metropolitan region, which will cause draught and lower the temperature of the air.
The air will warm up to 25 degrees of warmth in the day.
For example, on the night of Saturday in Moscow, there will be short-term rains, possible storms and winds up to 15 m/s.
Rain is expected in the day with storms and winds up to 12 to 17 m/s.
Rains with storms are also predicted in Orlov, Kur and Voronesh oblasts, reporting "Days.ru".
Next week, the rainfall is unlikely.
The WTO Arbitrator Panel found that Russian import duties on paper, fridges and palm oil ran counter to the rules of the organization.
The import rate is higher than Russia ' s commitment upon joining the WTO.
“This is the first time the World Trade Organization has taken a decision against the Russian Federation,” states the official website of the organization.
The arbiters, however, stressed in their opinion that the European Union had not provided sufficient proof that Russia's measures “were systematic” or “comprehensible”.
Russia, in turn, has promised to adapt import duties on paper and fridges in the near future.
This is stated in the report of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kyiv intended to complain to the World Trade Organization about Russia ' s actions, which had imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Federal Times wrote that the US's behavior in resolving the issues at the WTO undermines the organization's principles of discussion.
Brazil, Japan, the European Union, and other members of the WTO made a similar statement because Americans refused to approve South Korean Judge Chan Song Hwa for a second term.
The Russian Federation would therefore not go to the WTO on the question of Western sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation.
The World Trade Organization (WTO), an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It is now made up of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The president's office has been replaced by a leader
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has appointed former Deputy Sergei Ivan Anton Wyno as head of his own administration.
Wladimir Putin has reorganized the office of the President and has expressed the hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
Anton Wyno, in turn, stated during the meeting that he considered the anti-corruption work that he had begun to do as head of the administration of President Ivanov and pledged to work with the Government.
In the past, "Izvestia" has stated that the experts consider the resignation of Sergei Ivanov as the head of the administration to be transparent and comprehensible, and the reshuffling of the Kremlin administration will not make any fundamental difference.
They note that the head of the President ' s administration, who has been working for a long time, has effectively set up the AP.
He was replaced by the Deputy Chief of Administration, Anton Wyno, a man who is well aware of the specifics of this job.
In Poland, it is assumed that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The Polish State Oil and Gas Company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years the supply of gas from the Russian Federation may become unattractive to it due to the redirection of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company, Bogoslaw Majetz.
His words go to TASS.
"Maybe we're not going to buy gas at all (Gasprom's), we're now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines for us will be the East, the raw material from SPG-terminals and Norway," said Majetz.
Gazprom is currently dominant in the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 had provided it with almost 5.3 billion m2 of gas, 30 per cent above the 2015 level.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG procurement rose to 49.8 per cent, as compared to 40 per cent a year earlier.
On 22 July, the Polish Antimonopoly Authority did not agree on the establishment of a joint venture, Gazprom, and its European partners in the construction of the North Stream-2 gas pipeline.
This month, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion m2 of gas to North Flux 2.
Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President of the Holding Board, said so.
The Northflow 2 auction will take place in 2017, and the auction is scheduled to take place in the fall of 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom was not yet planning to take any action in connection with the intention of the Polish party to give up long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, and Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President of the company.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, Poles had only increased by 42 per cent the purchase of gas from the Russian Federation.
The substitute for Gazprom added that the mere fact of a Polish PGNIG application to the Stockholm Court of Arbitration did not mean the cessation of the negotiations.
The Polish company had previously applied to the court to bring down the purchase price of Russian gas.
Let us recall that the Polish Government's Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter of Naimsky, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to renew the Gasprom contract for the supply of gas.
The Polish contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and is due to expire in 2022.
In March, the Polish Government Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter of Naimsky, stated that his country could give up the supply of blue fuel from the East in six years.
He said that Warsaw was planning to build a new terminal for the supply of liquid natural gas, Baltic Pipe, which would link the country to the Norwegian shelve.
Northflow-2 provides for the construction of two strands of a sea gas pipeline with a combined capacity of 55 billion m2 of gas per year from Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine ' s border with Crimea.
Alexander Hug, the first head of the SMS in Ukraine, reported this.
"I can confirm that the SMS has increased the number of observers in this field," he said, in response to a question from the press, he sends the RIA News.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border between Ukraine and Crimea is calm, and there are no security incidents.
Observers tracked what was going on at the three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of a passenger jet, Yak-42, landed at Ufa airport on the Internet, rolled out of the airstrip by 400 meters and fell on the left wing.
The video was released by "360".
The emergency occurred at 4:30 in Moscow time.
The flight to Krasavia from Sochi arrived.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to a parking lot.
Ufa Airport is operating in normal mode.
The DCI has been working to find out the reason for the heavy landing of the plane.
The United Nations is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict have denied the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Stephan de Mistura, has found the fact to be undeniable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of the inter-Syria talks, to start at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists have launched an investigation into reports of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
First information on the toxic gas attack, suspected to be chlorine, was available on 2 August.
The opposition then stated that, in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the previous day, the aircraft dropped the poisonous bomb, but in Moscow the charges were called a dump.
The Russian Ministry of Defence later accused the opposition group Harakyat Noor al-Din al-Zinka of the incident.
Soon it was reported that the toxic-gas bombs were two.
This was confirmed by BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I smelled gas, I started burning my eyes, it was hard to breathe," quotes an accountant.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people died, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the action will be considered a war crime.
The United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said to the press, "Proof that this has really happened is a lot."
The non-admissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is set out in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Despite the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict have denied the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of the use of chlorine by the Syrian Army against the “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo is made more difficult by the daily shelling of the area, and by the terrorists, which prevents the population from leaving the city.
As Reuters says, the United Nations is waiting for Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in military action.
The organization's three-hour daily tranquillity regime is considered “not enough to help the nearly 2 million civilians trapped.
Staffan de Mistura ' s humanitarian adviser, Jan Egeland, stated that a 48-hour cease-fire would be needed to bring the sick and wounded to the city and to evacuate them every week.
“We have to send bulk cargo from a lorry column to a place where the roads are almost destroyed and the rest are mined,” Mr. Egeland reported. “But the Russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table.”
Consultations between the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” are continuing in Geneva.
How Russia opened the "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing fight for Aleppo, the second-largest Syrian city, Russia announced on 11 August the establishment of a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will be in effect daily from Thursday.
The creation of “humanitarian windows” is intended to enable the delivery of medicines, food and basic necessities to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation has been taken against the background of the growing international pressure on Moscow to halt the military operation and to facilitate the resumption of the negotiation process.
Four people died in a series of bombardments in the resorts of Thailand.
Immediately, a number of explosions erupted in South Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people were killed in the attack, 19 were injured.
The explosion epicenter hit the city of Hua-Hin.
Of the victims, 10 were foreign nationals of four States, and none were Russians.
No terrorist groups have yet taken responsibility for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs has hastened to state that Islamists were not involved in it.
A number of people have already been detained on suspicion of organizing the bombings.
According to the preliminary data of the local police, the scale and nature of the bombings indicated that they had been directed against the country ' s military leaders.
Attacks took place in popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the area of Phuket and in the city of Hua Hin, Thrang and Surat Tani.
Since the military junta came to power in the country in 2014, economic growth has fallen from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism has remained one of the few sectors that have shown development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, an increase of 1.5 million over the 2015 figure.
The first suspects in preparation and organization of the attack have already been apprehended, as reported by Colonel Chrisana Patancharoen of the Police.
It was too early to talk about the goals, he added, but to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the country was “convinced that they were not linked to international extremist groups”.
It's too early to draw conclusions,' said Mr. Patancharoan.
But we know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact, they're local subversions, and we're trying to find out who was behind them.
The bombings took place on the birthday of Queen Sykrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely to target it.
According to the police general of Sithich Srisopacharoenrat, the bombs were bombed remotely, with a half an hour apart.
They were hidden inside the trees on lively streets filled with lunchers in restaurants.
It is well known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who was selling street food.
The identity of the other victims is not yet known, but it is known that they are from four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai Police, four of them are German, three Dutch, two Italian, and an Austrian.
The Russians are not among the victims of the bombings, and Rostourism's press service has been reported.
The local experts also link the bombings to the referendum held on 7 August, in which 61.4 per cent of the country ' s population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitutional commission appointed by the military junta.
Voters needed to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role to play in electing the country ' s Prime Minister.
The new system has been adopted and will be tested for the first time in the parliamentary elections of 2017.
On 22 May 2014, Thailand experienced a military coup under the leadership of the Army Commander of Praut Chan-Ouch.
To that end, he said, the army has been driven by an ongoing political crisis and a lack of progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military created the National Peace and Order Council, imposed a curfew and censoring, dispersed protesters and the upper House of Parliament.
How Bangkok was in a state of emergency
The Thai Government, led by Premier Yingluck Chinavat, in January 2014, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the surrounding provinces.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Like in Bangkok, two explosions went off.
In January 2014, in the middle of Bangkok, two explosions occurred at the Victory Monument, where a major protest took place, affecting 28 people, five of whom were in critical condition.
Explosions have been made by unknown motorcyclists.
The authorities reinforced security in the capital and engaged the military to protect the protesters.
The development of conditions has begun in Dry Loga.
According to OS, the Government has been asked to agree on the draft terms of the gold ore auction with two key limits.
It is proposed to prevent a company with 25 per cent or more of foreign ownership and those whose capital will not have a minimum of 25 per cent of State participation.
The industry does not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players are not at risk of taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August, and it can be held in October.
The Ministry of Nature has introduced a draft order and terms of the auction to the largest unprocessed gold mine in Russia, Dry Log (Irkutsk Region, Reserves and Resources - 130 million ounces), and has told two sources of OS familiar with the situation.
The project was introduced on Wednesday evening, explaining one of them.
The Department of Nature has confirmed "OJ" that the project has been submitted to the government.
A representative of vice-premier Alexander Cloponin, the curator for non-drug use, said, "OK," that the project had not yet been made to the office of an official.
“Auto may be announced in August, as soon as the Government order has been issued, and in view of the time limit for the bid of potential bidders (at least 45 days) the tender may be held in October,” said the Ministry of Nature.
According to OS, the project had two key requirements for potential participants, as set out in the version, which was sent to the ministries and FOIVs in July (with OS).
The first is the presence of at least 25 per cent of government participation in capital.
The second is the denial of access to the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on an understanding of FM-57 on investment in strategic societies.
According to the two articles mentioned in the draft, the FS, as already “NO” on 2 August, may not be allowed to auction by a company whose beneficiaries (25 per cent or more) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have a dual nationality.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, as Dry Log is part of a federal area (stocks of more than 50 tons of gold).
In the Department of Nature, the project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies”, but refused to comment on the details prior to the Government's order.
The demand for public participation in the auction was put forward by Irkutsk oblast, spoke "OK" in the Ministry of Nature in December 2015 and later confirmed by the Governor of the Region, Sergei Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor, Sergei Eroschenko, who "have an investment agreement with Rosteh".
Who's lobbied the ban on the admission of foreigners, the "OZ" interlocutors don't specify.
"But it's in the spirit of time: not to give control in Russia's largest gold field against the background of Western sanctions," he reasoned with the "UZ", who is familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The head of the Department of Nature, Sergey Donskaya, stated on 1 August that foreigners "can go to the consortia" if the bidders involve them "as a financial entity, as technological partners."
The interviewees think it's unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender in the industry in Dry Log is the consortium of the largest gold miner of the PAO, the Pole, under the control of Suleiman Kerimov's son, Said, and Rostech.
In July, the partners created the SP "SL Gold", where the Pole has 51% of the share, and the RT-GR's "Rostach" structure has 49%.
In Rosteche, the comments were rejected, and the Pole stated "OW" that "unquestionably, it is an asset of interest" and has all the necessary competences and resources to develop it.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be taken after the declaration of the terms," was added to the Pole.
AFROSA may be involved in the auction, but the decision of the Russian government was said by the sources "OJ".
The Russian GV Gold and the Canadian Kinross, which are developing assets in Chukotka, claimed to be able to participate in the development of Dry Loga, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to OS, are not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of Gold Industries of the Russian Federation, Sergey Kashuba, in December 2015 estimated the “NO” investment in Dry Log at $2,5-4 billion.
Most of the potential bidders are scaring off not just the volume of the investment, but also the complexity of the project: there is a need for a serious exploration of the stock and the technology to deal with the complex ores, explaining the industry's "OL" interlocutors.
On the pension market, the M&A's largest M&A deal, the "KIT Finance Pension Administrator", began the process of merging the four NFPs under control.
As a result, a NPF of about 373 billion roubles will be created on the basis of the Pension Fund.
The start of the process of merging the four pension funds, KIT Finance, Promagrophon, Legacy and Gazfund Pension Fund, was announced by the owner of 100 per cent of KIT Funds by the Pension Administrator.
“The reorganization shall be in agreement with the CB, subject to the requirement of non-degradation of the terms of the contracts in force,” the company's report states.
The association is based on the Pension Fund.
According to the NPF Director, Oleg Bjalošiski, the pooling of funds has a number of objectives: to expand the geography of presence, to concentrate resources for development, to reduce costs, to replicate the best practices of each of the funds, and to optimize corporate governance.
He said that the target date for the completion of the consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the NPF, the Pension Fund will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As at 31 March, the pooled fund ' s pension savings amounted to over 373 billion roubles.
According to the records on the Fund's website, the beneficiaries of the Fund's owner, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (with 65% under the OLG's control) and the Gazzond NPF (35%).
However, the group itself launched much later the competitors.
For example, NPF group O1 "The Future" swallowed the Stahl Fund earlier this year.
The joint NPF is now joining the Uralcib Foundation and the Russian Standard.
“In addition to cost-cutting, a unified structure is needed to meet the structural challenges”, notes the NPF Director of the Future, Nikolai Sidorov.
The Safmar-NPF “European”, “Education and Science” and “Region Fund” have been active in the consolidation of funds since April and are expected to become part of the Safmar NPF by the end of this year.
The NPF Trust will join them in 2017.
“The pooling of funds will have the effect of strengthening risk control, transactional processes and costs,” noted in the Safmar Pension Group.
The pause in the pooling of funds that KIT Funded the Pension Administrator may be due to a number of reasons is indicated by the experts.
To date, NFPs have not been able to purchase more than 40 per cent of the volume of infrastructure bonds to which the group has been active.
Since the amendment of the CB regulation in March this year, there are no such restrictions for a number of issuers meeting the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, one major player can buy out the entire issue,” states the director of the AKRA Financial Institutes Rating Group, Yuri Nogin.
A number of NPF top 15 managers on assets have another possible reason for the pause to refer to the division of areas of influence and, as a result, to the appointment of a single fund to be agreed upon by the group's owners.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenko was not available for comment.
The request for an OLN to the NPF "Gasfund" has also not been answered.
While the consolidation of funds is a labour-intensive and inexpensive exercise, this decision will be justified at a long distance.
As Sergey Ocolesnov, the CEO of the Pension Partners Consulting Company, notes, the Pension Fund has less outflows, the joining will stabilize the base of the group's other funds.
In doing so, the better experience of the NPF, KIT Finance, and the Promagophony will be needed in the construction of retail sales of OPS, as well as in the use of more modern software.
The CB's demands on NPF's processes and human resources have been on the rise, so it is not appropriate to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, and Paul Mitrofanov, the Corporate Rating Manager, is of the view that "Expert RA" is an expert, who is a member of the company, is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who
"The effect of a reduction in duplicative functions will definitely overshadow the possible cost of merging," observes Mr. Mitrofanov.
The cost of joining the four funds is estimated at 30-50 million roubles.
“The cost of the four funds of this size is about 400 million roubles a year, with the consolidation in the medium term, the budget is actually halved,” Mr. Ocolesnov is sure.
The best Disney movie, "Pete and his dragon", was in the Russian market.
New Zealand's beautiful species, the charming dragon, the persuasive history, and the country-style songs are enough to rethink old-fashioned magic, and they think it's HERLEN CRAWSON.
The frightened little boy was picked up by a dragon, who became a human baby, a dear nanny, and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his friend Eliot, after a pup from a fairy-tale book, plays catch-up with him, and falls asleep in a hug.
Six years later, when he was thrown in a hedge bandage, he could no longer be distinguished from the other intelligent forest rind, Mowgli.
In this way, Pete is found by a red-haired lady named Grace (Brice Dallas Howard), while a crew of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively bogging the woods.
Now she'll have to not only believe in the dragon's existence, she'll have to help save it.
Pete's in a fast-track course of being a man in an idyllic American environment that wears boobyjacks, moral code in the heart, and smiles more glamorous than any commercial.
No character looks or acts too terrible for a viewer to really hate or fear it.
Even Gavin, who has discovered a hunt for an untypical inhabitant of the forest under his control, is far from an incorrigible villain.
The big, fuzzy dragon also turned out not to be scary at all, with the good face of a bulldog, the airship's wingspan, and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon is funny, squealing, even whimpering, and, fortunately, he doesn't say it, but he's always wanting to iron it, so it's very different from all the famous movie dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his way of sticking is such a high degree of emotional engagement that, in the most stressful moments, weeping in three streams, not just small viewers, but also adults.
Brilliantly good and young Oakes Figley in the role of Pete, breaking up between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtually gives out a canonical grandpa who would love to have literally every child.
How did the director, David Lowry, manage to make a fantasticly sweet remake of a forgotten Disney movie, "Dracon Pete" of 1977, mediocrely from the nose to the tip of the tail, memorized by a mix of animations and a game movie, and make it the most emotional movie of this summer?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
In his picture, Lowry, in fact, took two things from the original: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There are music numbers and most of the weird jokes left over.
This fairytale reads the traits taken from "Bambi", "The Alien" and many other sweet kids' hearts.
Disney Studio continues to successfully expand the Gallery of the 21st century high-quality remakes.
Of course, "Pete and the dragon" is not as stunningly beautiful as "The Book of the Dschungel," and it has no clever villain as Kate Blanchett was a stepmother in the new Cinderella.
But this naive movie is no less successful in believing in miracles and good in the best Disney tradition.
By the way, the keys to Disney's magic lock is gonna get to the director of Lowry again - for the art adaptation of the "Peter Pane" story.
In "Pete and His Dragon", David Lowry and scriptwriter Toby Halbrooks entered a new ambitious project on a non-adult boy in a James Barry fairy-named fairy tale.
RBK Journalist Alexander Sokolov will be charged with a new charge.
The lawyers of RBK journalist Alexander Sokolov, who was accused of organizing the activities of an extremist entity, stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had found deficiencies in the case of their client.
We learned from the investigators that the Public Prosecutor's Office made this presentation just yesterday.
We have been scheduled to attend a court hearing on the issue of limiting the knowledge of the criminal case file, but the proceedings have not been held, and the investigators have informed us of the presentation made by the Public Prosecutor's Office,” RBK quotes counsel, Olga Dinze.
She said that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had indicated to the investigators that there was a mismatch between the qualifications of the case and the material collected.
Now the investigators will have to fill the gaps in the evidence base and bring a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (PC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze clarifies.
Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015, as reported by OS.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded the RBK journalist from the charge the language of “demonstration of the political situation towards instability” and “disruption of power by illegal means”.
==History==AlEXANDR ZILBERT, a Correspondent of Commersant Boscosport, lived in the Olympic village, inspected the home of the Russian team, lunched in the local dining room, and even passed the WADA test.
I don't think life's dying for a second.
Even at night.
The last launches are sometimes completed in the middle of the night, after which the athletes need an hour and a half to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, there is an unchecked settlement and eviction from the village, as some athletes complete their performances and leave Brazil, while some are just arriving here.
At 7:30 a.m., the heads of all the Olympic delegations are stretched to one of the time shadows.
At these gatherings, we usually discuss some of the operational issues of the family, as the head of the Russian Olympics team, Igor Kazykov.
The hot water problem is, I'm sorry, the toilets.
We've been fighting for a long time to be clean.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the clinters started to come, but they just put some stuff on the floor, that's all.
The floors are, you see, kind of innovative.
Like, you can't wash them in a human way.
We know these floors - common laminate!
So, we got a change in the Clining Company, and now it's OK.
The Olympic village is such a Southern Butovo, a dormitory area bordered on one side of the mountains, and on the other, a massive puddle of water.
And for the sake of security, there is still a two-metre iron fence, along which the automotives are walking.
In total, up to 17,000 people can be accommodated in 3,604 apartments in 31 homes.
On one of the 18-story buildings, there's a massive Russian flag hanging out -- this house is entirely for our team.
By looking at a small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems seem to be the most pressing for the national team.
There are two announcements at the check-in: the print "Please don't put the paper in the toilet!" and the hand "I'll give you the badges.
The bar itself drowns in the tracts.
Their fun color contrasts with the titles of the brochures: "A Remembrance on Infectious Diseases for Going to Rio de Janeiro", "The First Help in drowning, Abortion of an Unborn Body in the Breathing Pathways, Loss of Mind - Steps of Cardiovascular Reanimation", "The First Help in Burns, Heat Shots, Brokens, and Brightings."
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example: "Infectation is accompanied by fever and subsequent recovery.
But not everyone is looking forward to a positive outcome.
Of course, there is a health centre in Russia, which is available at any time to assist the people in the home with skill, including a relaxing and sporting massage.
On the other hand, the health centre is the very headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspirational poster, "No matter what, we're gonna win!"
And, of course, verse:
All the argument is absolute madness!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Even less of us, the sweeter the taste of victories, Russia will not give up, it will not break!
And for even more uplifting, there is an ad: "Dear brothers and sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia Kirille, the protoyer Andrey Vladimirovich Alexeyev is the spiritual care of the athletes of the Russian Olympic team.
You can order a prayer and other demands on the phone...
In general, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religion for all faiths in the countryside.
And the Russians, in a privileged position, they have their own chapel.
In view of the load of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth, I decided to go down the staircase, which is recommended for use in the fire.
And in the dark, he stumbled on the bodies on it.
Apparently, it was the sleeping staff of the new Clining Company.
I think, at any moment, they're ready to go to the innovative sex washing, and they've decided to set up a quiet time right on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was expected to meet a long-time friend, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, a trainer of our tramps, who led them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and the European champ, Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
We live in two, and the beds, of course, are almost upside down, but it's not critical.
The sanusel is one on four, but it's spacious.
The cupboard, of course, is funny, from the fabric, is not trusting, but something can be put down.
"No, you're pretending they're out of tea!", the tennis player Svetlan Kuznetsov, whom I met in the main dining room.
The main name is at least because it is a space of 2,700 m2 and is ready to receive 5,000 visitors at the same time.
They give 60,000 meals a day at the top of the table for free.
The menu options are: "Brasil's best", "The world's Kitchen", "Asia dishes" and "Pizza, pasta."
The last option, I've been watching, is very popular with our volleyball player.
And let's say I didn't find soups in any of the units of a giant restaurant.
What kind of soup is that?
It's a good thing I've taken Chinese with me.
And a kettle.
But in fact, just so you know, we've got worse food on our court.
There's something you can choose, despite the unbearable homogeneity.
I personally selected cod for the pair and meatballs in tomato sauce.
A tablet with its name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, and an indication of the food value of the product and the availability of allergenes, is placed next to each dish.
Well, well, I'll tell you, it was edible.
I don't even know why this line is always at the local McDonald's.
We have our best friends from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) waiting for the warm, relaxed, warm sportsmen on their way out of the restaurant.
It's a tricky quiz with a T-shirt in it.
Provoking, you can say!
To get a gift, you have to answer at least eight of the ten questions right.
There are questions in the Russian language! - I was attacked by a girl from the Wada.
But the wrong man was attacked.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic rush, of course.
The situation has become worse on the second question: "If I have been notified of doping control, do I have to go to doping control immediately?"
I'm on option B, "No, I've got one hour."
Lost, so to speak, my guard.
I've forgotten that you don't have to wait for the wada to relax.
Well, we have to show up right now.
And in the seventh stage of the quiz, my position was very critical.
For some reason, I thought that if I find it hard to keep a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and I'm hard to do, by the way!), I could use bio-additions to get "additional nutrients to increase my productivity."
No, they don't!
In fact, the answer is worded in a way that categorically does not prohibit, but is strongly discouraged in a number of sentences.
It's not fair to play this wADa!
How's it going, Russia?
There's no backing back, behind Ephesus, behind Isinbayev, and our entire bloodless team.
So I focused, and I won a miserable T-shirt out of my last strength.
Know what they say, ours!
In a victorious mood, I went to the fitness center next door.
I got into the math of the simulators.
It's 250.
He was amazed to note that no Russian sportsmen had been found in this bulwark of runways.
But maybe it's the right thing to do.
Let someone who can't play can train!
And here's a guy in a health centre next to us.
In line for the eye doctor.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
In the health centre, as well as in the whole village, there is a condom outlet.
There is an enlightening call on it, "Continue with the condom."
The next thing to do is to spin a iron like a door lock, and a condom, made of a natural latex of the Amazon, is ready to drop out of the machine.
I've got one to remember.
Athletes don't get away with it. 450,000 of them have been brought in.
There is a whole entertainment center in the Olympic village for a holiday and holiday.
There's an inquisitorial plaque next to it, reminding us that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in a number of ways.
The center is full of video games, billiards and tennis tables, board football and hockey, and some kind of strange device like a video app.
What is this? - I'm interested in a friend in the form of a Ukrainian team, who is active in using a wild toy.
You could, of course, just say you don't want to talk to a man in the form of Russia, and that's all.
There's, by the way, some kind of bizarre confluence in the eyes of the kids in the yellow-blue.
The most playful team, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to get around the village by looking at every corner of it.
But if you're walking, instead of driving in electric carts, you're going to get a house with a Canadian team of salmon at the entrance and a tent with a resting bath, and a ticket office, and a laundromat, and a barbershop, and a flower shop, and a shop with daily items, and a post office with unique stamps (but you still can't wait out of the queue from Chinese philatelicists), and a bank, and an office of finders, and a photo shop.
And late in the evening, you will sit next to an olive tree, shackled with colored tapes, in memory of the friends and relatives of the athletes who have left this world.
And you're going to be on the sidelines of a car that sprays the insect-death liquid in a random way, thinking about the eternal.
I mean, the Olympics.
Which in this village never stops for a moment.
While the rest of the Russian world was watching the Australians almost punish the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Not a lot of people know, the news that Inna Deriveau won the gold at the XXXI Olympics was my first.
Maybe I'm the only one in Moscow who's ever seen it happen -- except for the ones who, of course, watched the Carioca competition that night.
That can only be understood by a real fan.
Imagine a deaf Moscow night.
Neighbors from the bottom, as always by 1:00 a.m., wake up and start to yell at each other in an innate, but very loudly.
And it's frightening to move the furniture.
There's a crane in the kitchen. There's no time to go to the market and buy a new one, as the plumber asked.
There's nothing in the TV calendar, so I just kept track of Mach, First, and just in case "Russia" - though it's almost pointless.
"Russia" is the home of repetitives, all the sports in there for some reason.
There's a live TV show.
The hope is, of course, on "Match" - the whole evening, a young man in the news was yelling first about the great semi-final of Deri-Shanaev, then about the next gold fight.
It'd make sense to show you.
But instead, basketball is the US-Australia.
I can't say anything wrong about this decision, by the way.
The Australians were on the same page, the first half won.
Putting in place the Americans who are fabulous from their own grandeur.
As a result, we have lost, but, as we now see it, the Olympic Basketball tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all right, but the fight with D'Francis is coming up, and there's no change on the screen.
In a simple panic, I'm starting to send out the canals.
It's like it's the second time in a row.
All right, let's go down to the cables.
None of Match's thematic fencing.
Oh, I feel like the fight's about to start.
I don't like texting and tweeting some sports sites.
Sudden surfing produces an unexpected but brilliant result.
On the first page, it turns out that all the competitions that take place at this point in time are being aired directly.
I'm calling for the fencing, I'm getting a gold match.
Deri-eye is a very good match, goes up the sunglasses, and it's very clear that it's starting to take time.
The Italian girl is playing most of the part.
Ours is one point ahead, a little more than two seconds to the end.
Dee Francesca throws at Deriveau, it backs off, the time is running out, the Italian is injecting.
Victory!
In a couple of seconds, the Olympic Messenger on the phone reports a fourth gold medal.
So I'm the first to see it with my own eyes.
Crazy, loyal, involved.
The Muslim Spirit Authority (DUM) of Tatarstan has refused to use the Russian language in mosques.
Last night, the DUM Plenty ordered its imams to give their Friday sermons only in Tatar to make the young Tatars learn their native language.
The Department states that this “does not in any way impair” the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazani complains that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60 per cent of the parishioners, including foreign students, migrants, and the Tatars themselves.
Imams fear that their sermons will not reach the entire audience in Tatar.
Yesterday, the plenary of the DUM Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the Moslems of the Republic in Tatar language alone.
As Tatarstan's mufti Kamil Samigullin has said, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to learn their native language.
"For those who say "threatening," in every big mosque, we intend to organize the Tatar language classes at no cost," Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that “the decision has already come into effect” and today, in all the mosques of the sermon, “must be in the Tatar language”.
He recalled that the Dome of Tatarstan publishes a magazine called Sura, with standard sermons in Tatar.
The imam, who is not good enough to speak Tatar, "can be well prepared for it."
The DUM of Tatarstan brings together more than a thousand parishes in all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to the mufti, in the area of Friday, the preaching work is carried out in Tatar.
At the same time, in a number of mosques in Kazan, the Russian language was used in the past.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced at the Burneyev Mosque, Zacabanna and Aniler.
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed, the mission of the leadership is to make sure that all the students are fluent in both the national languages of the Republic, irrespective of their nationality.
“No harm can be said to Netarim Muslims,” Mr. Muhametshin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself is “not a compulsory, essential part of the prayer.
In doing so, the prayer itself will continue to be in Arabic, and the mosques will continue to have lectures and lessons in Russian.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said "OJ" that there was no serious threat of the banishment of the Tatar language from the mosques.
Other than Russian and Tatar, for example, Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, are not used in the Republic ' s s sermons.
The decision of the DUM was strongly supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCC).
The head of the WCT Executor, Rinat Zacrov, said, "OK," "Meceti are an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language were to go out of this field.
He pointed out that the preaching in Tatar was “the will of the imams themselves,” but in the use of the VCT,“they think it's the right thing to do”.
The imams interviewed, who preached in the Russian language, are ready to implement the decision of the DUM, but they believe that the parishioners will have difficulty in understanding the clergy.
Both the Tatars and the Russians go to the mosque.
A lot of people don't know the language.
They're gonna be a bit tight, of course.
"We're gonna have to remodel," says the Imam of the Burneyev mosque, Farhat Mavlettin.
According to him, the Russian sermons are even closer to many Tatars, since “the Russians are in school, in kindergarten, in radio, everywhere in the first place”.
However, he believed that the mosque would be able to continue its classes and lectures in the Russian language, which were held on other days.
We trust in God.
Allah will show you a way out of this," he concluded.
But about 60% of us don't know Tatar.
These are Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
"So we've been in Russian for four years," says the imam.
He believes that in the Tatar language the sermon will “go to a narrower circle and not reach the entire audience”.
But we will be subject to the decision of the plenary.
Just the result of the sermons will be different.
But time will.
"For example, it will be easier for me, because the Tatar language is my native language," concluded Gabdullah Galiullin.
Ex-director of FSIN has been brought to trial
The Moscow Public Prosecutor ' s Office has confirmed the indictment in the criminal case of theft of the budget allocated to the Russian Federation ' s FSIN, which has been investigated by the SCR.
Ex-chief Alexander Raimer and his deputy, who have caused more than 2.7 billion roubles of FSIN, will be brought to trial.
The Metropolitan Public Prosecutor's Office sent a criminal case to the Zamovoret Rice Court against Alexander Reimer, the former Director of the Russian Federal Penal Correction Service, his former Deputy Nikolay Krivolopov, and Victor Odenov, the Director of the Federal Penal Enforcement Service, the Information and Technology and Liaison Centre.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are charged by the SCRG in Moscow under article 285, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code (abuse of authority with grave consequences), article 159, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code (fraud committed using their official position, in an organized group, in a particularly large amount).
In addition, Kryvolopov is charged under article 222, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the SCR, in 2010 - 2012, the individuals in question fraudulently stole from the State Treasury the budget allocated to the FSIN to provide the agency with an electronic monitoring system for those under control, so-called electronic bracelets.
For theft of the budget, the team developed a scheme whereby the PITOC FGCO, under its control, with which the relevant State contracts were entered into, produced technical means of control and supervision, including “electronic bracelets”, and implemented at a cost overstretched several times.
Despite the fact that CITOC's FGCO did not have production equipment, buildings or facilities to accommodate the production capacity to complete the production of “electronic bracelets”, five State contracts worth more than 3.3 billion roubles have been concluded between it and the Russian Federation.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion roubles have been found in the accounts of the Samorian branch of the FGL, of which 1.2 billion roubles have been stolen.
The result is that more than 140 million roubles of cash in cash were received by Mr. Raimer personally in his office from an accomplice for whom a criminal case has been assigned to a separate proceeding.
Nikolay Krivolopov, who was involved in the scams, was found to have an unknown origin of a gun with a decorative gun, making it possible to bring an additional charge against him.
In this case, with a volume of 133 volumes, the FSIN has filed a claim for 2.7 billion roubles.
Hakan Shukür's football player is suspected of involvement in the Putch.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former footballer and then a member of Parliament, Hakan Shukur, and searched two of his family ' s homes.
The star of Turkish football in the 1990s, the early 2000s attacker Hakan Shukur, is wanted by the national authorities in connection with the attempted coup d'état last month.
Forward, who completed his sports career in 2008, is charged with belonging to a “armed terrorist group”.
This is a movement of Chismet, a society associated with a prominent Turkish religious figure and opponent, Fethullah Gülen.
It is his President, Erdoğan, who considers the organization of the military coup attempt that took place on 15 July.
Fethullah Gülen is a resident of the United States, and the Turkish authorities request his extradition.
Local media report that a warrant for the arrest of Hakan Shukür has been issued today, and the police have already searched two homes belonging to a former footballer ' s family.
According to the investigation, his father also joined the Fethullah Gülen organization, in addition to Hakan Shukur.
But neither the former footballer nor his loved ones were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a football player, Hakan Shukur defended the colors of a number of Turkish clubs and promoted the country.
He spent most of his career at Galatasarea.
The list of foreign clubs includes the Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as the English "Blackburn".
True, he didn't spend more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukür is still the most effective attacker of the Turkish team, with 112 matches for the national team and 51 hits.
In 2013, Hakan Shukür left his position as a member of Parliament, due to the beginning of a corruption investigation into Erdogan's party and its immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurryet, at least 42 journalists had been arrested in Turkey on 25 July.
They are accused of contributing to the military coup and to their links with the opposition Islamic preacher Fathullah Gülen, who lives in the United States.
In view of the severity of the charges, the media can wait for a long prison term, from 10 years to a few life sentences.
Egor Konchalovski wants to set up a network of cinemas for domestic films only.
"I would have set up a network of cinemas exclusively for a Russian movie, for which the tickets cost two to three times as much as for a foreign-made movie," he said.
Mr. Konchalovski observes that it is hard for Russian films to compete for a viewer with big Hollywood tapes.
We have over 100 paintings in the country a year, with an average of 20 to 25 tapes coming up to the screens.
"And even they find it very hard to compete with Transformers and Iron Man, "with massive budgets in their promotion," said the movie director.
Recall, on 1 July, the All-Russia Youth Education Forum “Tavrida” began work in Crimea.
The participants include artists and young professionals in various creative and humanitarian fields from all over Russia and from a number of countries in the near and far-out of the country.
The British conquered the Olympic gold in the academic row in twos.
The British Helen Glover and Heather Stanning won the Olympic gold in a two-way academic row.
Silver was taken by New Zealand women, Rebecca Scoon, and Genevieve Beren, and the third place was taken by Anna Anderson and Hedwig Rasmussen from Denmark.
OO-News - The new contractor promises to deliver Zenith Arena by December 26th.
The new designer of the St. Petersburg Stadium, which is to host the Cup of Confederates 2017 and the 2018 World Cup, is about to sell the arena by 26 December, reports to RIA Newsty, with a reference to Vadim Tulpano, head of the Federation's interim commission to prepare for the 2018 World Cup.
"Today, we, together with the Minister of Sport of Russia, Vitaly Mutko, went to the construction site, and we had Vadim Aleksandrov's CEO with us.
He said he'd sell out the stadium by December 26th.
It's a big peterburg company, it never breaks the deadline.

The Russian Copper Company (RMI) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMI has taken up the modernization of one of the country's oldest and most polluted companies, the Karabash Med Melting Combine.
The Carabasian copper mill was founded by the British stock company, led by Lesley Urqwart in 1910.
In the Soviet era, it was an industrial business of importance to the country's economy, and it was in fact an entire city.
In the 1990s, however, due to financial problems, production was halted, resulting in serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998 a decision was taken to resume the work of the Karabash Medal Combination.
One of the main problems of the Karabash plant was also to be addressed.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already infamous as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation in Karabasmedi began to change in 2004, after the company was under the control of the Russian Copper Company.
The company has begun to modernize production, which has gradually reduced the environmental burden on the environment.
This was also noted recently by Governor Boris Dubrovsky of the Chelyabe oblast, who visited Karabashmed in the early days of July.
The head of the South Ural called the big changes that had taken place with the business since the Karabashmedia moved to the RMI group.
The main activity in modernizing Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new serno-acid plant to absorb up to 99.9 per cent of the metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Copper Company, the total investment in the project was about 7 billion roubles.
The next phase of the modernisation of the Karabashmead is the reconstruction of the converter.
The replacement of three converters, sprayers, gas tracts is planned for late 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
In addition, it is planned to launch a new 1 billion- roubles industrial effluent clean-up facility at the end of 2016.
In turn, there will be an increase in the amount of taxes paid to the city of Karabash.
For the entire period of the Tomin project, from the start of the construction to the start of Release 2, the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion roubles.
And once the PCO has been put into operation, the tax to all levels can be 80.9 billion roubles.
In the year of production in the Varnen region, 346.3 million roubles have been allocated to the budgets of the various levels.
And this is the first year.
"The longer the business is working, the more the contribution can be," he added.
The RMI specified that in 2015 tax outlays from the Miheev PCO were about 1 billion roubles.
However, the participation of RMI enterprises in the life and development of their territories is not limited to tax contributions.
The RMI enterprises help to renovate and maintain schools, day-care centres, sports facilities, the construction of cultural and recreational facilities, and the development of areas.
In 2016, one of the major social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabash was to renovate, and in fact to renovate almost the N9 kindergarten by 95 students.
The building, built in 1960, was in an emergency state.
Also on the RMI Arena, there will be a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and extraterrestrial parks for 600 car parks, cafes and sports shops.
RMI Arena will allow for international sporting events.
But the main objective of this project is to make sports and sports in a comfortable environment accessible to the people of Chelyabinsk, especially the children.

WSJ: The U.S. is considering imposing sanctions on the Russian Federation due to the hacking of the Democrats' servers.
US officials are considering the introduction of new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of Democratic Party servers, writing The Wall Street Journal with links to sources.
In order to impose sanctions, US President Barack Obama’s administration is reported to have to formally charge Russia’s servers or Russian-backed hackers.
According to the sources, the FBI and other United States intelligence agencies are almost certain of Russia's involvement in the cyber attack.
WSJ states that the US tends not to name the hackers.
The exception is the 2014 break-in of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, for which the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was officially responsible.
But last year, Obama issued a decree making it easier to impose sanctions on those who implement or support cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but it can be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions can be long, writes the edition.
Even if the officials have come to the conclusion that the hackers acted with the support of Russia, they will have to weigh the possible consequences before making a decision on the disclosure.
They have to determine whether the incident is so serious as to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
It has been previously reported that the Obama administration has allowed sanctions to be imposed on a State whose hackers have hacked into the Democratic Party National Committee servers.
WikiLeaks has published an e-mail to the National Committee of Democrats.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities might be involved in the break-in.
In the Kremlin, such reports have been described as absurd.
FAS fined Google for almost half a billion roubles
The reason was the disruption of the market for mobile applications.
The anti-monopoly trial was initiated by the Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google provided smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that banned pre-installing applications from other developers, such as the Yandex.
The FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company was abusing the dominant position in the market and was imposing other applications with the Google Play store on the manufacturers of mobile devices.
As a result of the audit, the Federal Antimonopoly has decided to punish Google, and has informed the FAS head, Alexei Dozenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that all companies, including transnational corporations, must comply with the law on the protection of competition.
Google, in turn, will first look at the solution and only then be determined to follow up on it, either to implement it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service found the company to be in breach of the competition law as early as September last year and ordered the contract to be adjusted until 18 December.
But Google didn't agree to it.
Since then, the company and the agency have been in court.
The FAC noted that despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of a settlement agreement.
This measure will not result in anything.
This was the opinion of the leading analyst of Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazine also noted that the fine would have no effect on the users or the competitiveness of the company.

Previously, in the State Security Service of Ukraine, it was reported that at the border of Crimea, the rotation of Russian troops was nearing its end.
According to the agency, the updated personnel have more modern equipment.
Bulgaria shows inflation for the first time in eight months
Inflation in Bulgaria was 1% monthly in July, as national statistics show.
This is the highest number in the years (June 2012) and the first one over zero since last October, when a positive 0.2% was shown.
The average annual inflation measured by the CPI over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8 per cent.
The consumer price index in July 2016, compared to June 2016, was 101.0 per cent, a monthly inflation rate of 1.0 per cent.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016, as compared to December 2015) was -0.2 per cent, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2 per cent, as compared to July 2015.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, the price of the following consumer goods was as follows: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7 per cent); transport (1.8 per cent); rest and culture (6.3 per cent); restaurants and hotels (1.2 per cent); and other goods and services (0.3 per cent).
The cost of clothing and footwear has fallen (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and regular maintenance (0.5%); and health (0.1%).
The prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcohol and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.
The Anime effect of Snapchat is critical of Asians.
Snapchat states that this filter is inspired by animosity, but some commentators say it's racially insensitive.
Using the Linux tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and to play with individuality in ways that border absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character to frame a picture of Roy Liechtenstein.
The lenses are ruthless, twisting features of tools that produce more than 30 million adjusted selfies a day.
Any error is fast becoming common knowledge.
The Snapchat lenses have been critical in the past when they have been accused of advertising the dark skin of the face or of encouraging white faces as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users this week were offered a lens, which gave them scented eyes, crooked tooths, and bleak cheeks, some critics viewed it as a racist caricature for the Asians, the "yellowfaces."
And they wondered if these repetitive contradictions point to the company's more serious problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, news reports and further resentment on The Verge and Motorboard, the day after Snapchat claimed to have removed this function.
The company commented: the lens was designed to be animé characters, not a cartoon for Asians.
But for experts who know about racism in the first place, the lens reminiscent of insulting stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the analogy.
In an e-mail to Grace Sparpani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet of the photos was very much shared, she said that the lens was "intimidating and at least embarrassing."
She added that "it's hard to argue with a comparison of a very rude caricature on the Asians and the filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow, it's highly degraded yellow.
Snapchat is not the only company to pass through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, from the corporate halls to Hollywood and the deveys we all carry.
And a huge audience of young people in Snapchat -- who are more racially diverse than their older generation -- can mean that they're more likely to expect to understand.
When one of the Snapchat lenses created an image that was offensive to the user, then, in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Cathy Joo, "it's much more difficult to stay unnoticed as it used to be."
On Thursday, Joo, a product manager and an engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her account to Snapchat and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said that she believed that racial discord was the reason for the lack of diversity in the recruitment of staff in Snipchat.
==History==Zhu was critical of a white company that was composed of only men and finished her article with #DeleteSnaphat.
As Zhu, who is herself an American of Chinese origin, writes: "Everyone in the state didn't have enough non-white people to make such decisions, or they have non-white people, but they do not hold positions in which they can speak in a secure and transparent manner."
Other viewers share her view, dissatisfactioning that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origins of his staff, but according to a confidant, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented segments of the population and to actively try to attract domestic resources.
For her part, Zhu said that she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us so they can say it's not going to work."
The military has misplaced ISIL intelligence, reports to Congressional Commission
Members of the Central Command of the United States Armed Forces have been altering their intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which is the reason for the incident on the ground, and have reported to the Congressional Commission in a report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the task force set up by the Republican Chairmans of the House of Representatives Committee on FAA, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Appropriations found a “widespread dissatisfaction” among the Central Command Intelligence Analysts, who claimed that the leaders had misdirected their assessments of American actions to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military agency in the city of Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Intelligence documents approved by the Centcom High Command tend to give a more optimistic picture of U.S. anti-terrorist action, as the actual data from the scene suggest, and have been steadily more optimist than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies,” said a news release on the report.
"What happened in Centcom is not acceptable: when the top-level leadership is misunderstood, our military suffers," said a member of the House of Representatives, Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
The management problems in Centcom are at the top of the organization.
The ten-page report deals in detail with the inadequacies that continued to emerge in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions to train the Iraqi Armed Forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain the final proof that the Obama administration has ordered the falsification of the reports, it states that the analysts felt that the Centcom leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony from the Central Command of Congress were much more optimistic than real events,” the report reported.
For example, Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul can begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second-largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is certain," said House of Representatives member Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid2014 to mid2015, the top U.S. Central Command Intelligence Service has forged command intelligence to lower the threat from ISIL in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a task force when they found out that the analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed data.
An additional, unfinished investigation into the intelligence of the Centcom is being carried out by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
The representatives of the Democratic Party on the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress published their own data on Thursday, which is in line with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
“In between 2014 and 2015, the Centcom set up an overly closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi Guards,” states in a statement by a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Shiff, the main representative of the Democratic Party on the committee.
This procedure, according to Šiffa, “stopped the release of intelligence documents”, was detrimental to the morale of the analysts and “not enough to reflect diverging views”.
But Šiff and the Democrats claim that they found no proof that the White House was trying to force Centcom analysts to fit their findings into a "task or political interpretation."
The preliminary results of the Congress's investigation were presented on Tuesday at The Daily Best.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector of the Pentagon, which was opened after the Centcom Analyst's complaints.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Department of Defence would not comment on the Congress report while the Chief Inspector was still investigating.
But he said that “experts sometimes differ in the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a sound dialogue on these vital national security issues”.
The implications of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American bombardment in Iraq and Syria has reached the target (as is now being claimed by more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year’s statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism over the Islamic State echoes the controversy that took place more than a decade ago, when an intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article alleging that the administration of President George Walker Bush, because of the protest of many analysts, was in favour of a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest caused by intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, Hooker’s team found that, despite public statements to the contrary, the attacks on the oil refineries belonging to the Islamic State had not led to a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the terrorist group, because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not distributed outside the Central Command, as the Times reported in September.
The then Centcom commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after the testimony in the Senate, which many deputies found to be overly optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was reassigned to the Central Command of Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The US wins four times in a row in a women's hockey on the grass, bringing it closer to a decisive fight with Britain.
The one who once hit three goals in the game, which ended up winning Japan with a 6-1 score, Katie Bam opened the account on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's hockey team on the grass, when the Americans won the 3-0 Indian team.
Five heads in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, who is 27 years old, says she's not sure if she ever would have done something like this.
"I don't know," she said.
I'm not really the kind of guy who's been tracking his goals.
Here's what she knows: Americans 4-0 at the Olympics, and they're competing for the first place in their band with Britain, which remains invincible after Japan loses with 2-0 on Thursday.
The British and U.S. teams will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
The two teams claim a quarterfinal, and the result of the game will determine who will be number one in their group of six and who will be number two.
The victor will avoid meeting with a strong Dutch rival team, the leaders of another group, in a bit of time, when the quarterfinals play.
But Saturday's game shows that the Americans here made a lot of noise in their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams at the London game.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time, taking a hockey club on the grass when she was three (her older twins played this sport in Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She skipped the 2008 Olympics when she didn't make her final selection tour.
Then it came to 2012 when things didn't work out for her and her teammates.
The following year, Koyg Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed a trainer, and everything began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, physical change," Bam said.
In London, we didn't have the productivity we have right now.
We've completely changed our mindset.
On Thursday night, Bam opened an account in the first half of the game with an inconvenient hand at a short distance.
India went to the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly hard and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative into his own hands.
She made a long pass with the ball down on the left side of the field, then slid in the middle, and sent the ball up to the gate, giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "Dirty" win was the first one in the United States goalkeeper's game, Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's hit.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good position right now," Parnham said, "but how good it depends on the result of the Saturday game.
In the midst of the turbulence of the Olympics, the day of the trampoline spikes
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio seem constant and inevitable, and this is a rabid mix of competition and ambition.
It's like the Olympic fire itself is the burning torch that goes from the archer to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper, or eavesdropping your neighbors in turn at the coffee shop, and not hear about Simon Bayles, Cathy Ledeki, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time, a handsome man with holes on his cheeks, could well be among the celebrities in prime time promoted by sponsors and life-promoting commercials if he was a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a fencer.
But the 28-year-old Dooley, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline race.
The Olympic fire does not cover all events in the same way.
Farther from the center, in part in the shadows, there are sports that are not universally recognized: a pneumatic gun, an onions, a badminton, a taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long rulership.
But if I'm allowed to speak with shyness in defence of my personal affinity, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of leaps on the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumps have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many of the people I have interviewed have not been aware that they are all about the Olympics.
This can be regional ignorance.
Even though the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won medals in trampoline jumps, and their athletes didn't go to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russians tend to share male rewards, while Chinese and Canadians share female rewards.
Dong Dong from China and Rosey McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But trampoline jumps have an outside charm, in particular, because for an uninformed ear, they are more associated with a circus college than with the Olympics.
Here I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just a grounded enthusiast.
They do have a comical potential -- a caricature glimpse of endless leaps -- but also the elegance of gymnastics and water jumps, the two sports that they basically combine.
The word "batut" is derived from the Spanish word "el thampolín", meaning "a leap in water."
The bidders are jumping on a giant trampoline, flying about 30 feet in the air, and have to do a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends, and saltos) before they land on their legs.
They are evaluated by execution, difficulty, and flight time, according to the official programme of the Olympics.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is to go ahead.
The bidders for the medal must go on, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to the end, and sometimes to the back and forth, up and down the field.
They not only aim at the finish line or the start wall, but also, in view of the TV cameras, at another frightening point: the world or the Olympic record.
It's a noble, admirable, even fanatical pursuit, and it's enough to make even the viewer cry.
But I think it's a bit tiring to watch the game.
He's giving me a break to jump on a trampoline.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps up, seems weightless, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then without the effort to get up again.
And, of course, they don't go without competition or difficulty, but throughout the program, there's no crazy zeal for the end, no long jumps, just a strange, elegant, time-lost and gravitational.
It's the closest thing to an olympics day.
Women's qualification competitions, and then the finals will take place on Friday afternoon, an hour of the day in Eastern European time, and a man's on Saturday, as well as an hour.
The NBC will air the finals on the day-to-day program from 2:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, we expect a quiet, beautiful moment that can be easily gleaned in a common dump.
And if a rise in consciousness can be achieved only by exposing male athletes to a hunted view and to the lens, as the Wall Street Journal has recently suggested to male hymns from the United States, Dooley is just waiting for his new enthusiasmic crowd of fans.
"The Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, a long-time ally of the United States
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia have been faced with a violent opposition from the Government.
Witnesses say that dozens of protesters have been fatally injured in a confrontation with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of a rift?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country, extending to an ever-growing number of its territories.
In the last week alone, thousands of people went to the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s response was brutal.
Witnesses claimed that police officers shot dozens of unarmed protesters.
Videos from the protest sites, allegedly taken at the end of the last year or earlier this year, show how security officers beat young men with sticks when they put their hands against the wall.
The highest United Nations human rights official now calls for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been hard to keep this country from falling apart, and it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project in an international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
The United States military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to address the terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa is receiving such support from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably, even with a new suburban train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia has hardly been a model of democracy — human rights organizations have always referred to government repression — the opposition in the State has been suppressed by the fact that the dissidents have in fact been silenced.
Many of them have been banished, imprisoned, killed or expelled to remote deserts.
But it can change.
"When people are constantly suppressed and left with no other options but to protest, there will be an uprising," said Seyoum Teshoma, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints range from land use to the takeover of power by a Government coalition.
After much-critized elections last year, the Government party and its allies completely displaced the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament.
At the same time, the tension along the border with Eritrea is on the rise; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border has cost hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less demolished in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use upheavals and re-arm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, which have been boiling deep for a few years, are now on the rise.
The first one seems to be completely harmless: smartphones.
In the last few years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace, and Internet services have improved.
Even when the government shuts down Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people still find it possible to communicate through a proxy server that hides where they are.
A number of young Ethiopians said that this was how they organized themselves to protest.
The second, more solidarity exists between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, Amhara, from predominantly Christian highlands in Ethiopia, has flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in low-lying areas.
But it also changes.
"We will work together under a unified command," said Mulat Hemem, the leader of Oromo.
The major protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population, and which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of the upheaval is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, up to his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have foreseen the danger.
Analysts claim that he was particularly skillful in recognising the first signs of discontent and using spies to get data and neutralize the opponents.
"The current regime lacks common sense," said Abdi, an analyst in conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Dessalin, appeared out of nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a Southerner.
Analysts say he has no trust in Tigray's security services.
Many fear that this will result in more bloodshed.
For the last time, Ethiopia experienced such upheavals in 2005, after thousands of people protested what the analysts said was probably an election that the government shut down and then forged the results.
In the ensuing repression, many Protestants have been killed, though in a smaller number than in the last months, and this period of upheaval has been relatively fast.
The development experts expressed their appreciation to the leaders of Ethiopia for the far-sighted development of the infrastructure, such as the new long-distance train and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not halted the increase in internal dissatisfaction by the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondara, a city in Amhar, attacked the Tigray-owned businesses, and anti-Tigrean hatred on social media is becoming all-encompassing.
Analysts claim that the protesters put the United States and other Western allies in an uncomfortable position.
The United States Government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it has recently announced that it has closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already fragile region.
"And it will be hard to get through this tight wire," said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIL was founded by Obama, "sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to cover up the last conflict that hit his election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when he said several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State's terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to address the American people in a sensible manner.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during a period of upheaval, in an awkward position, as they had to explain statements that he probably didn't mean.
After making this suggestion at the convention on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his approval on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the President and Clinton founded ISIL.
But in a Twitter post early on Friday morning, Trump said he was just ejecting.
This post was in direct contrast to the statement made just a day earlier, when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his charge.
When Radio Manager Conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his statement, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIL, the presidential candidate from the Republican Party did not take the opportunity.
The last scandal erupted when Trump tried to redirect his campaign to the economy against a low rating.
Trump and Clinton have given competing economic talks in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to get back to the subject.
Again using Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would increase taxes, and he said he found her speech boring.
Trump used sarcasm as an excuse before.
At the end of July, after he brought out the general criticism, in fact putting out the idea that the Russians should hack Clinton's email, he later explained his remarks, saying, "Of course, I'm kidding."
Such an approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permissible in political speech and to take it back when necessary.
"I think it's his way to test some of the messages that have been reciprocated among his fans, to see how they work, and then to "explain" them in one way or another, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who analyzed the language of the two candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his remarks, and he knows that they're vague enough to interpret them in a different way.
Instead of softening statements for a wide electorate, Trump has taken an even more sarcastic tone in recent days, while his ratings continue to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, released on Friday, showed that Trump was downing Clinton with a big outgrowth in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and was at a level in Florida.
Although Trump tends not to apologise for the inflammatory things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has been the focus of the presidential campaign in recent months, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support it, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, who is one of Trump's most-known vice-presidents, has made a serious effort to protect a candidate in an interview given by CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is an acceptable political comment," said Juliani, when he was asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIL was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it a non-threatening, totally unfair, and that's why it happened, because it led the troops out of Iraq.
Most of the average Republicans believe that the Obama administration, in which Clinton held the post of Secretary of State, has allowed ISIL to develop because it has failed to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to a meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the media for depressing every word he says and for discriminating against it.
He bullied the poor, miserable TV experts who were trying to figure it out, and he said, "They're weak!"
Some Democrats laughed at Trump's excuses as an undue proof that he was not fit for president.
The once-chanched coffee shop is back in Greenpoint.
Verb's coffee shop was shattered, taking only cash in Williamsburg, which didn't have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was pushed out of her room with a window on Bedford Avenue.
Soup Sherry, which took the place of Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of muffins.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in a new city.
The painter Molly Krabaple tweeted, "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe the CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is ruined, and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, being updated.
The Verb's renovated coffee shop opened in November last year at Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and they take credit cards, but there are some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
Plus, the coffee's still good.
The new Verba is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and manager-general of the new place.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there to the end.
When one of the clients offered to fund it in a new place, he said he'd be happy to do it.
Rodriguez, who was 36, left a lot of the same.
Verb is working with the same bagel distributor and bought the same model of a coffee machine.
It even has chandeliers from the old Verba.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He's offering new dishes.
The menu contains bake, egg, and cheese sandwiches, and there are capers or fried onions.
There's a dish of brown rice.
They don't have beer in the coffee shop anymore, but they're making freshly pressed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he'd noticed the constant flow of old regulars.
"Many ex-clients have also been squeezed off from Williamsburg," he shared.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, who was 34 years old, used to live in Williamsburg and often went to Verbe.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After Verba closed, she said she'd stopped drinking her coffee for a while.
"I realized it was the coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me in Verbe," she said.
Now she drinks her coffee again, though on that day, instead of a regular ice-coffee, she ordered a cup of tea, another new one.
Tom Rosenthal, another old client, has been a loyal visitor to Verb since 2003.
He stopped by before work and ordered the same thing all the time.
"At 15 o'clock, every day, like an hour, I came, and my bagel with butter and all the stuffing was ready for me," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and put new dishes on the menu.
Rosenthal is still doing the usual order today, but one day he'll change something with bacon, eggs, or cheese on a bagel with all the stuff.
Rodriguez said he wasn't offended by the fact that the soap shop once took over an old place.
In fact, Soup Sherry's owners have offered to make a special soap for Verb, using a cold-made coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we might agree to their offer," said Rodriguez.
The permanent residents of Greenpoint, of Polish origin, also loved the coffee shop.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the window to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has other benefits.
The local point for the sale of juices plans to spill bottles and sell cold-made coffee.
There's a chance the coffee shop will join the next building.
For a lot of clients, it's enough that the new Verb will put their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client, and he shared that he was saddened when they closed down.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Whitt said that when he went in and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he was back home.
"How long have I wanted to smell it," he confessed.
Depressive diet of depression in The Float Dinner.
In March 1933, shortly after taking up the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved the fashionable Fifth Avenue dishes, such as foie gras and the Meriland Turtle Suppe.
His menu on this day was more modest: the eggs in tomato sauce, the mashed potatoes, and the dessert pudding of prunes.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to feed."
Spouses in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in the history of food.
Coa's last book, "Rage in Chinese", was devoted to Chinese food in America, and Siegelman shared a history of life in a tenancy in the lower East Side via food in her book "The House of 97 on the Fruit Garden Street."
Their new work, "The Planet", to be published on Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.
In a sense of their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, simple diner in Flatairtown, which has been working since 1929, the year of the market failure.
Siegelman, 54, ordered butter cheese and a sandwich of olives, and Coy, 57, got turkey, mashed potatoes, and veggies.
When a reporter ordered a meat loaf, the couple found it a good starting point for a discussion of food in the era of depression.
"The roulettes were in great demand," said Siegelman.
There was peanut roll, liver roll, bean roll.
They were made out of a basic ingredient and low-cost products that allowed the ingredient to be stretched out.
Imagine you ate as much peanuts as you needed for dinner.
Coy's wrinkled.
"It must have been in the stomach with a rock," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in the countryside, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women cooked for male farm workers, and a fresh baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to the hungry Europeans during the First World War. The "Floy Tablet" describes how the country was dealing with what was suddenly no longer a country of plenty.
"It was a time when the food became a central, difficult subject for Americans," he said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new fiscal diet was just as complicated: cryptic dishes, such as rolls and bakeries, became basic foods; baking was a "precious way to take care of the blemishes," remarked Ziegelman, because cooks might have hidden non-appetital ingredients under a dense layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
The meat, which has been the basis of American food for many years, has become an economical luxuries.
People have tasted bizarre blends, because energy and nutritious values have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
In a study for a book that includes prescriptions, Siegelman made a dish of that age: baked onions with peanut butter.
"This addition to the dining table was not a success," he said.
Siegelman added, "That was very strange."
Peanut butter doesn't fit the liver onion at all.
This was common in many home-made recipes.
More than ever since, Home Economics — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Economics Bureau, from 1923 to 1943 — managed the country’s dietary habits.
By publishing prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “contributors of the budget, to accept the challenge, and to transform a burde like protetic spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
"Floy tablet" is a banquet of curious historical facts.
The government's response to hungry citizens is particularly picky, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let's eat pies."
Publicly proud of a simple farmer's cooking in Iowa when he was a kid, he was eating like a sophisticated millionaire, who he was.
"He loved the mainland kitchen, like fish with cucumber sauce," he said.
He ate almost in a golden dining room, wearing a tux.
It was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
As the book states, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was completely unfavorable, and this led to the White House "using not only the depressing food in Washington, D.C., but sometimes the most repugnantly cooked."
Many of the depressive culinary techniques have been forgotten as soon as the country is back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrients, says Siegelman, and how science was used in cooking.
The couple tell us that during the writing of the book, they were better able to understand the eating habits of their mother, Ziegelman, for example, that she could not throw away food.
"She was seriously afraid of being negligent about food," he said.
Siegelman remembers, "She's seriously poisoned people."
There was one nasty case with the profilers.
When the dishes at Eisenberg's were empty, he and Coe got the dessert that they made at home: the pruning dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a mousse of prunes," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common use - to give low-end prescriptions names.
There was no whipped cream, just pruning, a bit of flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone was reluctant to put a spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Coe asked for more on two occasions.
By the voice of a confident budget maker, he said to his wife, "A little ruble of walnuts would be a good thing."
The arrest of members of the Hovan Cemetery Mass Fight case was extended until 14 November
The Presnian court left the case of a mass fight at the Cemetery of Khovan on 14 November under arrest, granting the relevant request for an investigation.
In the case, there are 14 accused.
On 14 May, several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasian met with weapons at the Cemetery of Hovana, killing three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yuri Chabuyev, and a lawyer, co-founder of the public organization Health Nation, Alexander Bocharnikov, have been charged with organizing the murder.
The second indexation of pensions in 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
On 12 August, the Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation, Olga Hungerec, reported on his visit to the region of Britannia.
We have specific parameters as to how much we need to raise the pension in order to lower the inflation that exists in the country.
All the calculations have been made.
Now economists are taking stock of the half-year, and we will complete this work in the next two to three weeks," quotes the Interfax Hungerr.
Commenting on Alexey Kudrin ' s six-month plan to raise the retirement age each year, the vice-premier reported that the subject was not being addressed in Kabin.
At the end of July, it was reported that the Government had agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension benefits in 2017.
Kamensky and Gregorian entered the finals of the small-calibre gun match.
Russian athletes Sergey Kamenski and Kirill Grigoryan entered the finals of the small-calibre gun match from the position at the Brazilian Olympics.
According to TASS, Sergey Kamenski scored 629 points and ranked first, the new Olympic record.
Kirill Gregorian was the second, 628.9 was.
A total of eight of the top athletes entered the finals.
Kamenski is the world record in this discipline (633).
The Turkish opponent, Fethullah Gülen, demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup d ' état in Turkey.
"I demand an independent international commission to investigate an attempted coup," quotes the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opponent also stated that "if any part of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Guelene has in every way denounced his involvement in the country, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
The Istanbul court previously arrested in absentia the opposing Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen.
Let us recall that the military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of 15 to 16 July.
Gilead will reimburse the cost of legal services during a patent dispute against Hepatitis C with Merck
Gilead Science Inc. has the right to receive the legal fees it has incurred in connection with a patent claim for a drug against Hepatitis C with the Merck & Co Inc drug manufacturer, and the Federal District Judge has ordered it.
In June, Gilead was released from paying 200 million dollars of damages for the violation of two Merck patents related to Gilead's drugs, sales leaders, Sovaldi, and Harvoni, after an American judge found a number of violations by Merck, including affidavit lies and other unethical actions.
In an application to the court on Thursday, U.S. Federal District Court judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to the cost of the action.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, a new-generation medicament for Hepatitis C, which can cure more than 90% of patients with liver disease.
The case occurred in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to the lab work that was the basis of the sophosbuyer, an active ingredient of Gilead's drugs.
US-backed armed forces claim to have intercepted complete control of Manbage from the Islamic State.
The United States-backed armed forces took full control of the northern city of Manbridge near the Turkish border after the last remaining militants of the Islamic State left the city on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now purging the city following the departure of the remaining group of militants who have been hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages, who were held by militants, told Reuters by Charfan Darwish of the Allied Military Council of Manbridge with the VTS.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we're doing clean-up operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, which showed that the Democratic Party presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in performance fees, and the former Secretary of State announced an income of $3 million from the publisher of Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the Department of State.
Potential vice-president Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife, Anna Holton, has issued tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard for financial transparency," said the campaign manager Clinton Jennifer Palmieri.
Quite the contrary, Donald Trump is hiding behind forged excuses and is violating his past promises to make his tax returns public.
It's common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, though the law does not require them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers named the State Tax Service's audit as a reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
"Your move," writes Clinton Jan Sams on Twitter, with a declaration by a candidate from a democratic party.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the end of the audit.
Critics Trump, including a presidential candidate from the Republican Party in 2012, Mitte Romney and other fellow Republicans, said that his refusal raised questions about his state, his charitable contributions, his business operations, and other links, including with Russia.
Clinton took hold of the question, and on Friday she released an online video that focused on prominent Republicans who convinced Trump to release the tax records.
On Thursday, she raised this issue in a talk about the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what everyone has done without exception for decades: to publish their tax returns," she said to the assembly.
Politico reported that Trump had paid no or no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a business columnist in New York Times quoted many tax attorneys and accountants on Friday who thought that things might still be the case.
The federal tax rate was the subject of a debate in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after a billionaire, an investor named Warren Buffett, that would guarantee that people who receive more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, he invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he's also under IRS control, and Trump is "afraid" not of the tax agencies, but of the voters.
Clinton’s pre-electoral headquarters issued tax returns up to 2007.
Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration of 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 out of their income was a source of wages.
Their main investment was an inexpensive index seed fund, and the Clintons announced a dividend and a capital return of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Tanzanian environmentalists use a non-conventional way to stop the elephants from wandering into the localities, throwing chili-filled condoms in them.
The method proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with this idea a few years ago, along with the United States Nature Protection Committee, took over its promotion, training volunteers in the villages of North Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step way to protect their homes and crops without harming the animals.
Previously, a lot of people used spears to protect themselves.
Friday will be World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"Since we've invented a set of tools ... we've been seeing a change in attitudes within these communities, so they're much more confident that they'll be able to keep the elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," said the executive director of the Honeyguide, Damian Bell.
The first two steps are to light a torch before an elephant breaks the border and to signal with a horn.
If he can't be frightened off, the so-called chili cloud is tossed.
Chili powder, blended with soil, is put with a clap in a condom, and the end of it spins, and there's only a wick outside.
When a condom is lit, it breaks up with a roar, spraying small dust of chili powder in the air.
One blow is usually enough to turn the elephant in the other direction.
The extreme measure is a device that fires Roman candles into the air, making a loud, bright explosion.
To date, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey, who left the country after an attempt by the State in July this year.
Such data was given by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Mevlit Chavushoglu, in an interview with local journalists.
In the first phase, we withdrew 208 human resources diplomats to continue to work in the centre.
Of these, 32 have not returned without objective reason and explanation,” said the head of the Turkish foreign policy office.
Let us recall that a coup d ' état was attempted in Turkey in July.
The national authorities have officially declared that the State has failed, as well as reported the detention of more than 6,000 people, including high- and middle-level military personnel.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, 290 people have been killed as a result of the coup d ' état.
The Jewish director critically criticized the Berlin Hotel for removing Israel's "request" phone code to Arabs, as RT News reported.
The French director of Jewish origin has created a media scandal, finding that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli phone code on the list, and the employees refer to “requests” from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoa", expressed his dissatisfaction at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lentzman Hotel, he tried to find Israel on the hotel's phone code list.
The country, however, has not been mentioned among the States to which you can call directly from the room.
How could it be that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was expelled and eradicated?
It's been written by Lantzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own call centre.
In search of an explanation, the director raised the issue at the hotel office.
The answer he got there, according to Lanzman, "shocked him."
The Hotel Clerk said that this measure was "a thought-out decision by the Kempinski Hotel Network Management."
The reason behind this move has given the director even more anger.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel's code be deleted," said Lanzman, a hotel servant.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handellsman, described the incident as “a terrible shame,” reports the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
The fact that this happened in Germany, and it's in this network of hotels, is even more shameful.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident caused a lot of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel was just "going on" with the alleged demands of Arab clients.
"We'd be ashamed," said another post, where it was stated that the hotel, located on the glorious street Kurfurstendem, was next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself has hastened to drop any charges, calling it a "uninspection" and "apologise" to Lanzman, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel on the rapid recruitment list," quoted a representative of the Kempinski Hotel in the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students.
The students ran into the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered to protest against government reform of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when the police tried to disperse the students, which led to the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
A few hundred students took part in a demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
As proposed by the State Governor of São Paulo, Géraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public high schools will be closed down, and 300,000 students will be reassigned to save money.
Some protesters could be seen posting graffiti on the walls against the pro tempore President Michael Thamer.
This last protest took place just a few days after the protesters went to the streets to support the disassociated President Dilma Rousseph, when the Senate of the country voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71%, reports the RT Business Portal.
With the lifting of the sanctions, trade between Moscow and Teheran rose by 70.9 per cent over the previous year, according to the Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levan Jagarian.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there is a growing interest on the part of Russian firms in doing business in the country, said the ambassador.
Russian companies are reconnecting with Iran, and new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Jagarian said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran had increased by 70.9 per cent over the same period in 2015 to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was due to the supply of machinery, land transport and arms,” the ambassador said.
Jagaryan also forecasts a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic office in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly to tourists, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran has entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of visitors to Russia.
It is safe to say that last year’s record for the number of Iranian visitors to Russia will be crushed, ” he said.
At the same time, a relatively small number of Russians are visiting Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition," he said.
The State is still wringing hays in the defence-industry complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the “systematic failure” of the CEO of Almas - Antei, the “miss in work” and the “loss of trust”.
Gennady of Bender has been appointed head of the NGO for the next three years.
Information about the lay-off of Nekorodov only appeared on Thursday night and did not generate a wide media resonance.
What is the reason for such silence in the context of the massive rearming of the army?
It is likely that the management of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumours or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This proves once again that the Defence and Industrial Complex (PPC) has many problems, and the State is not willing to attract greater public attention to them.
The removal of Neborodov is no doubt an important development in ordering the industry.
The NGO “Almaz” is the main company of the company, which specializes in the production of marine and land-based air defence systems (SARCs).
Almaz is currently in the process of setting up the Polyment-Redut and Morphei RCA, which are to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia Portal, Dmitry Cornev, is of the view that the dismissal of Nescorodov is due to the disruption of the project time.
This is the most logical version.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007 and was expected to take place in 2013.
Polyment-Redut should be the main AVS system on the navy's most recent ships.
According to the information I'm getting, in a few years of testing, none of the real success tests have been carried out.
The truth is, as far as I can tell, it's not the absolute fault of "Almaza," said Cornev.
The expert is concerned that the “C-500” RCA may also be late for entry into service.
The design and development of the project has not yet been completed, but the first complexes are expected to join the force during 2016.
In the Department of Defence, “the work is planned and all will be completed within the required time frame”, although in 2014 the agency recognized the problem with the development of the C-500.
It is very difficult to assess the quality of Nescordov, who has been running the “Almaz” since 2011.
The root point was that project delays can be both a cause and a cause of dismissal.
In his view, it has become very difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in the PKK and business management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and a lot of money is known to love quiet.
Generally, the directors of defence companies leave their posts at their own will, under the agreement of the parties, or are reassigned to other jobs.
In the present case, the suspension took place in public, although it was not resonant.
This suggests that the head of "Almaza" may have been a stout figure and resisted the top-down "disarmament."
It would seem that the State no longer intended to tolerate such conduct.
By the hands of the shareholders, it will disqualify those who prefer to argue with the Department of Defence and do not carry out their tasks.
At the same time, the management of the Russian Federation is trying to punish the crooked managers (the star's shipboards).
The President himself has given more attention to the problems of the sector.
Wladimir Putin is the head of the Military Industry Commission and holds periodic re-arming meetings.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of the PKK managers in an effort to have a loyal number of directors who will follow orders from the top.
This is far from an ideal policy, but in the face of corruption and the lack of normal competition in the PKK, the State has no other instruments.
The current state of defence is, of course, not a catastrophic one, but the current geo-political environment is encouraging the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces to order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleaning” of the management in the PKK, the management of the Russian Federation has taken very successful steps to improve the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The army has acquired a new quality with the assumption of the post of Minister of Defence, Sergey Shoigu.
It seems that the president has adopted a well-known proverb, "You want peace - get ready for war."
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR, and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s, led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which anchored Moscow's sphere of influence on the continent.
With all the drawbacks of the bipolar system, it worked well.
The lack of war on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East prove this.
The cemetery of the “winners” in the Cold War has, in the end, led to the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in a “civilized world, ” there may be no quiet place left.
Despite the common misfortune, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such circumstances, the navy and the army remain the only allies of our country.
The strengthening of military power will make it possible for Moscow to better defend national interests and to enter the new frontiers of world politics.
The Scotsman Callum Skinner is running in the finish line, so the British take the bike gold.
The Scotsman Callum Skinner ran to the triumph in a male command sprint on a cyclist in Rio last night, and the British command trio defended its title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old man in Glasgow was the most powerful man his Scots friend, Sir Chris Hoy, made his own, and the young man proudly entered history, sniffing over the finish line to take the victory out of the foreman team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoy declared the right to the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they replayed the trick after they finished in a modestly sixth at the March World Tracking Championships in London, despite Hoy's retirement from that moment.
The question between Peking and London was to replace Jamie Stuff's specialist.
They did it right at the time the Hindes appeared.
Joy's departure also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was followed by British coaches, seeing the potential in the Scots, which was now realized.
Hindes, Kenny, the champions with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner set the Olympic record, but the norm was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British Trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner backed up.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hindes was on his way to slow down and let Kenny and, in particular, Skinner keep up the pace.
Hoy watched from his seat as an invited BBC expert and caught a look at Skinner, Kenny, and Hindez when they entered the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "This is a flattering comparison."
I'm here to do my best to make my name.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and won the world's champions.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindez deliberately fell on the track after a bad start.
He later rejected the comment, and there was no way to file an appeal from British competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like London, with all those British flags on the stand."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We've been out on so many world-name races, that wining the Olympics again was just terrific.
This is one event, one gold medal for a country that won seven of the 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is the barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the cyclist will have five more successful days.
With the form shown by Kenny, it's not beyond the ability to imagine how he's replaying Hoy's feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in the same game.
This would make it possible to see Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 – a sacred date in British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister’s birthday – bring his account to six gold medals and one silver medal.
It'd be the same as Hoy.
Next time, Kenny competes in a sprint, which begins today and is played for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Teamwork is always the best.
You're coming to win with your comrades.
It's a bit lonely to win alone, to be honest.
He said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he has to get knighthood."
It was the only medal day, but there was the next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke, and Owen Dull are qualified as the fastest four-mile command race.
They finished at 3:51,943.
The world record for the gold win in London 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and the finals (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will be the focus of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying race, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
At the relevant women's event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rosell Shend, Elinor Barker, and Cathy Archibald of Milgawi have improved the world record by showing a time of 4:13,260.
The British Command has come to rely on a powerful cyclist team to take over the middle of the Olympics and to earn a lot of medals.
In fact, after an exceptional demonstration of absolute supremacy in Beijing and London, expectations have been eroded in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There have been dramas in the second place, not the last one, leaving Shane Sutton's post of technical director in April, because of charges of sexism and harassment, and the departures of major figures, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But on the basis of the first-night cyclist race, it seems that the legendary fame of Britain in reaching the top at the right time may be recurring.
The future of the Portland metallurgy plant is at risk due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of a Portland aluminum plant in Victoria, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is threatened by the fact that an electrical company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant's owners, is about to terminate the delivery contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of a decision earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
A fixed 20-year grant is due to end in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, can be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 per cent of the total electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down the iron and steel plant at Pointe Henry, which led to the shutdown of the Englesey power plant last year.
The Alcoa Portland metallurgy plant loses money and risks closing.
This action was the result of a reflection on the future of the plant, which has been going on for a number of years, initially due to the strengths of the Australian dollar, and later due to the price of the plant ' s products.
The company AGL, which is supplying a major aluminium plant with electricity from its Loy Young A power plant in Latrobo Valley, said that it expected the other three owners to take steps to terminate the contract.
The controlling share of the plant is owned by a joint short-term company of Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp have a smaller share.
"The AGL company expects the Portland facility to continue working, that is, the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgy plant will not stop," she said.
According to AGL, the contracts in question are so-called “hedged contracts”, which were to come into effect in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period of termination, so they will in fact end in 2017.
"The AGL, accordingly, still expects that these contracts will bring their share of the revenue in FY17," said the Electric Company.
Any potential impact on AGL's profits from the 2018 financial year is currently limited by the forecasts for a strong futures market for bulk electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in terms of the “future break”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa's ability to run the metallurgy plant or to supply electricity to the metallurgy plant”.
An American company stated that it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Young in 2010, which was due to enter into force in November this year, but it still has to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland metallurgy plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the unfavourable economic situation in the industry.
Referring to analysts earlier this week, AGL's Chief of Operations, Stephen Mikkelsen, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year, and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
For us, as a producer, this will be bad," he said.
Not just the star of the Kardashian Reality Show, Kendall on the cover of the September Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, the model and the fourth daughter of the Cardashian-Jenner family of Chris' mother manager, appeared on the wanted September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the brand of Estee Lauder and defiled it for fashion weeks in Milan, Paris, and New York, reported this news in her Instagram account on Thursday.
"While I was in the room with my loved ones, I looked at the cover and weeped," wrote Kendall.
The news about the cover was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of the Cardashian Family?), a reality video, in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the Rob and Caitlyn Dessails, who also joined the world's favorite show business uncle, the producer of the Cardashian family, Ryan Seacre), forgot to show up on the cover and, at the end, a classical turn-off: they were planning a surprise party.
It's a standard storyline for almost all episodes of a children's TV show dedicated to a birthday. (Sirche says, "Do you think we've forgotten you?" with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit from the program at 8:00 a.m.), but Chris needed to get that fame to the other girls one way or another.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have no doubt entered the new era of the Kardashian show.
May Senior Nurse Kendall Kim have been on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband, Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is the best-selling version of Vogue in the year.
The volume, which is more like a gifted edition than a fashion magazine, attracts a huge number of advertisers. (Fashionista Portal, 615 pages from last year's 832-page issue, has included an ad.)
The news of who the stars are going to get on his cover is so eager to see that in the last two years, the images of the magazine have been combined to an official ad.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more "signatures that work in models" on the cover than "models that are celebrities."
The Oscar award and the face of the brand Dior Jennifer Lawrence was presented on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gage's honour.
But even in that unlikely event, if Jenner, whom the magazine described as an “excellent model” of his generation, falls in the first category, she's in a good company.
These celebrities are not relative to prominent people, stars of a reality show, or modern kids who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner is in all of these categories).
They're really talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, which appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the best in his career in connection with the release of the "Lemonade" album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, in view of her last TV reality show star, was always supposed to be shaky.
In June, one of the first Victoria's Secret models, Stephenie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her co-worker, Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment."
These sentiments again swelled after the news of Jenner's appearance on the Vogue cover.
But it doesn't make sense to focus on dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September Vogue.
She's a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you tone cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in her own apps available on a fee-paying subscription.
She sells hand-made photographs of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, maybe to still see her sister Courtney and her kids, she's on a reality TV show.
Public legal centres refuse to service 160,000 people per year
Every year, more than 160,000 least-protected members of the population refuse to serve in public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an effect that will result in further cutbacks in the already overexploited activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly the elderly, the immigrants, the unprotected workers, the victims of violence, the people who are unable to combat unfair property deprivation, and so on — have already been denied access to free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services, which are already operating outside the scope of their capabilities, are preparing for further reductions.
From June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of Queensland Public Law Centers, James Farrell, said that according to the last census report of the National Association of Public Law Centers, thousands of people are being refused a year.
Farrell said that if the Federal Government's decision was not overturned, the situation would only worsen.
"The Queensland Public Law Centers are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people are denied vital services," he said.
People who leave a violent relationship, people with unmanageable and bankrupt debts, families who go through a divorce, unfairly dismissed workers -- all of them have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut the funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means that thousands of less secure Queensland residents will have to deal with complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately cancel these cutbacks so that people can get the help they need when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise the funding of free legal aid to the national average.
The time has come to focus on the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and it is time for the Government of Palasczek to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's pre-electoral headquarters was sued after an officer was allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump's campaign headquarters was sued: the headquarters allegedly didn't do anything after the report that his operations director in North Carolina threatened a staff member with a gun while they were on their way to the jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court action filed on Wednesday at the State Court in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state's pre-electoral headquarters.
Bordini said he'd been waiting a few months for the problem to be solved internally, but he realized "it's not gonna happen."
Director Earl Phillip "screw a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and directed a blow to Vincent's lapcap," so Bordini states in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional office of the pre-electoral headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more people had been involved in similar incidents with Phillip, and was confirmed in the appeal.
"Pistols don't have to fire to cause harm," said Bordini in a complaint.
The action took place just two days after the presidential candidate from the Republican Party made a fuore, telling the North Carolina listeners that the “men of the Second Amendment” — understood as possessors of the arms and their amateurs — could begin to act if his rival, Hillary Clinton, was elected and was able to choose the judges.
Trump's pre-electoral headquarters said that the media had taken his words out of context, and that he was not in favour of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini claims compensation from the electoral headquarters for sloppy control, and Philip for the threat of physical violence, assault and moral harm.
The representative of Trump Hoop Hicks is slow to respond to the request for a comment.
Trying to talk to Phillip was not a success.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Philip recently left his campaign headquarters.
In response to a phone call from his consulting firm, Innovation Consulting Services, no one called back fast.
A presidential candidate from the Republican Party, Donald Trump, waged a debatable campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For Presidency Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Supreme Court Division of Mecklenburg County (Charlotte).
Britain must put the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring renaissance and prosperity, not only in our localities and in London as a whole, but also throughout the country.
For me, this was exactly the great advantage of Heathrow, just like it was in London 2012, where we made every effort to make sure that our peoples and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics have been of great benefit to Stratford and the East End.
And we're gonna do it again, creating opportunities for locals and firms next to Heathrow.
Only for our localities here will we create 10,000 new interns, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just like London 2012 was, there will be those who think that the task of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics, and that we would find ourselves in a predicament on the world scene.
Sceptics were wrong in 2012 and will be shown to be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about it.
Like the Heathrow Olympics, it is an infrastructural project for most, not just for a narrow circle.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have an excellent team in Heathrow, which has put in place a programme of 11 billion pounds of infrastructural investment on time and within the budget, from T5, the best-elected airport terminal for five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's two most active airstrips.
They are now ready to provide a third runway, backed up by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The London 2012 Olympics have been a major success for Britain, and I am sure that Heathrow's expansion will be as well.
The time has come for us to put the Olympic spirit on the right track and expand Heathrow, providing our trade future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton - Chairman of the Heathrow Council and former Commercial Attaché of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing cat-and-mouse on the blocking of ads.
For companies that make money on Internet ads, trying to bypass the software to block ads is a game of cat-and-mouse, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced that it was going to block ads on its desktop version, Adblock Plus posted a blog saying that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social media again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that a desktop version of the site would change the roll around its ads to make it more difficult for blockers to recognize what parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now states he was able to bypass the new code.
In a blog by Adblock Ben Williams, “this kind of interplay between the open source advertising community and those who try to bypass it has continued since the invention of the blocking of the ad,” and it is possible that Facebook will present its own solution in the near future.
The fact that the world ' s largest social network has been engaged in a struggle is a clear sign of how major a problem has been for the industry to block.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use advertising blockers, according to last year's Pagefair and Adobe study; almost four times as many people used such software in 2013.
Taking into account the 1.3 billion daily active users who go to Facebook via mobile devices, mobile ads now account for 84 per cent of Facebook’s revenue from advertising.
The company, however, hunts out on the desktop, as mobile ads are not effective in mobile Facebook applications for social media and Instagram, according to the representative.
Still, the ad in the desktop version is a lucrative article enough to make Facebook think such a step is a lucrative investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was about to update its “advertise” tool to give people more control over the way the ads roll.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that the new Adblock filters are a source of concern, as they will also block some unprofessional content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to address this problem," said Facebook in an official e-mail.
Advertisers are a rude tool, so instead we focused on the creation of instruments such as Advertisement to hand over control to people.
A woman was moved on a Swiss motorway in an incident of an apparent suicide.
The victim was on the freeway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a number of vehicles on the freeway have been moved to the public in the early hours of Thursday morning, in a clear attempt to commit suicide.
The incident took place at A1 near the Morge in Canton Vaughn just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a sign of desperation" and she was hit by a number of vehicles, told the police in a statement.
Clearly, the victim, a Swiss woman at the age of 49, was hit by a number of vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
A number of involved drivers have already been interviewed, but the identity of some has not yet been established, and the police have been told to call on them and others who have witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was brought, a “logical” step in this situation, and counsel, Gille Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve, stated.
However, it is still to be determined whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a hit?
That's what the D.A. has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case, both of which involve a man walking in the dark on the freeway, it has been condemned that motorists cannot expect to meet a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of death by negligence after she hit and killed a man lying on A1 near Pyern in the night of August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim was drinking and blacked out on the road, in court.
The court found that a female policeman — who responded to an emergency call — was driving a vehicle that was justified, and that the presence of a man on the road was a “exclusive and unpredictable situation”, the judge said.
Anyone in possession of the incident on Thursday at the Walrus has to call the police for 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have once been inhabited, as the new NASA climate model has been estimated.
Scientists from the Nasova Institute for Space Science, Goddard, have developed a model for the study of the past Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine if Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and an atmosphere over-saturated with CO2, could ever have a climate like the Earth.
Scientists have previously assumed that the low rate of turn of Venus is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the last simulation suggests that Venus may have had a dilute atmosphere like the Earth, and still spin slowly.
The model also reviewed the topography of the early Venus.
There were probably more drylands on the planet than on the Earth, but once it had enough water and enough geographic variability to make life possible and to prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent of the party.
"According to the GISS model, the slow turn of Venus has set up its day-to-day side of the sun for almost two months at a time," explained a GISS scientist, Anthony Del Henio, in a press release.
This warms up the planet's surface and produces a rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, acting as an umbrella that protects the planet's surface from an essential part of solar heat.
The result is an average of climate temperatures, which, surprisingly, are a few degrees colder than today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, which is similar to that of the planetary scientists.
Despite the fact that Venus may have been inhabitable in the past, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for a few billion years.
Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was burned with ultraviolet radiation.
When her hydrogen ran out, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect -- that is, Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers shared the results of their new climate model in Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is leaving as a coach for the Avalanche team.
Patrick Roy left the position of coach and vice-president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey business on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
The executive vice-president/chief manager of the Colorado team, Joe Sakick, confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have served as Chief Coach and Vice-President of Colorado Avalanche hockey with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
Over the summer, I spent a long and hard time thinking about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needed and to raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice-president of hockey must be ideally in line with the vision of the organization.
He should also have the right to vote in making decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not been met so far.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick has informed me of his decision today," he said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish it success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and was losing the playoffs for the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced an evaluation of 39-39-4 in the 2015–2016 season, and was five points behind the Wild team in the run for a second concession to attend the Western Conference.
The gateman from the Hall of Fame, Roy, won four Stanley Cups, two each with the Montreal Canadas and the Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Renewed Talks and Suspension of Strike
Working strikes on the North Sea oil workers ' salaries have been halted, and all the parties to the debate are embarking on a new round of negotiations, with the lead representatives of the parties reporting.
Strikes against the Wood Group Oil Service Company were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and United and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve the current disputes,” states the joint statement.
We will hold a number of full-time meetings for the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of next week, to look at the problems with a fresh look.
The trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in over 25 years, was directed against potential wage cuts of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group has this year reduced the rates paid to North Sea contract workers by about 9 per cent due to negative market tensions.
The company ' s rate fell after a 10 per cent reduction in the rate for land-based contractual employees in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts would give it the space needed to break down the market.
Shell, for its part, shortened thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in countries up to 10, as it is rationalizing its activities as a result of its mega merger with the British company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower prices of unpurified oil: the economic situation has deteriorated due to the decision to withdraw from the European Union in June by Britain.
The Scottish Member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major labour conflicts in the North Sea of this era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and all over the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to the average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of the stars in the Pleyad.
Kepler's last mission to the Space Telescope has helped astronomers to gather the most complete catalog of the rotational speeds of the stars in the Pleyad.
New data help astronomers to understand why the stars in a cluster are spinning at different speeds, as well as how the rotating periods relate to the formation of planets.
"We hope that, by comparing our results with other celebrities, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Louise Ribal, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analyse at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleyad is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now just getting ripe; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they'll ever be.
At their peak speeds of rotation, these growing stars emit large amounts of star wind.
By traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds have a slowing effect on the stars.
As the star grows older, its rate of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of the recognizable star spots, such as the solar spots.
The newest rate-of-turn catalog suggests that the more massive stars are spinning slower than the less massive stars.
The fishball compares stars to dancers: larger ones make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In the ballet, we see that those that spin slowly, usually more massive, while those that spin faster tend to be very light stars," said Ribal.
Since the Pleyad's aggregation is so close, it is the ideal space lab to compare the properties of stars with the speed of rotation.
"Sternal aggregation of the Playade provides a point of departure for theoretical models of rotation of stars, both young and old," Ribal said.
We still want to learn a lot about how, where, and why stars slow down their rotations and hung up their "dancing boots," figuratively.
The fishball and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the Rotation Speeds of the Pleiades in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation of a group of Ukrainian delinquents in Crimea is carried out by two departments, writing “Commersant”.
The FSB is gathering evidence of the involvement of the detainees in the preparation of sabotage in Crimea.
As previously reported, a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, Eugenius Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation, gave a confession.
He stated that he viewed the chemical plant Titan in Armenia, the oil base in Feodosia, the Kerchen ferry, the gas pipeline, and one of the military airstrips as targets for sabotage.
The law enforcement authorities believe that not all the collaborators of the subversives have been apprehended.
This has led, in particular, to the arrest of suspects in the Kyiv Rhyd of Simferopol, notes the publication.
Stanislav Cerchezov was the main coach of the Russian football team.
At the meeting of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislaw Cerchezov as the main coach of the Russian football team.
The contract will be for two years, until the end of the MM-2018.
On 11 August, the Russian Federation appointed Stanislaw Cerchezov as the head coach of the Russian football team.
He was a well-known footballer who used to play in the Moscow "Spartake" as a goalkeeper, as well as a trainer with solid experience, who was the mentor of Russian teams such as the same "Spartake", "The Pearl-Sochi", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dinamo", and the Warsaw "Legia", who was the winner of the national supremacy and the country's cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cerchezov will be signed as soon as possible for a period of two years.
So he's the one who has the duty to prepare for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that Miroslav Romachenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikiv will be part of his training staff.
There's information that the entire trainer's office's salary will be 2.6 billion Euros a year.
According to the media, the Russian Federation has set Stanislaw Cerchezov as the goal of bringing the Russian team to the semi-final and winning the medals.
As the trainer himself has said, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team to be a priority, and he is going to give the footballers an opportunity to show off.
Also, according to Cerchezov, he's glad to have the choice.
The first match, led by Cerchezov, will be held in Antalya on 31 August, and will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Recall that Leonid Slutsky was previously the head coach of the Russian football team, who combined him with the coaching at the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation after the failure of the Russian national team on Euro-2016 in France.
In doing so, he took responsibility for the bad result of the team.
Embarrassed between Angola and South Africa, Namibia has been hard hit in the long struggle against apartheid.
However, since independence from South Africa in 1990, that country, with a population of 2.4 million, has made great progress, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success was the Government ' s focus on education.
While people in developed countries see free primary and secondary education as a matter of course, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary school fees are required.
Moreover, Governments are often encouraged to introduce “cost-reimbursement” fees.
In Namibia, however, primary education is free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also been free of charge.
The country ' s authorities are also active in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 per cent in the last 10 years.
Despite the international trend of rising inequality, Namibia has been reducing it.
The Gini ratio, the standard index of income inequality, fell by 15 points from the 1993 figure.
At the time, 23 years ago, this was one of the highest in the world.
And the poverty rate fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) has also fallen, from almost 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest rate of free speech in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country has far ahead of the United States and other rich nations.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the “Indice of Perception of Corruption”, which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia has been able to maintain a high rate of growth.
At the same time, the ratio of debt to GDP is about 25 per cent, less than one third of the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The rate of unemployment, at least in the traditional method of estimation, is still relatively high - almost 28 per cent.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS - almost 17 per cent of the population is infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is one of the top middle-income countries, but the authorities insist that their State is in fact a developing country.
Namibia is, of course, facing some of the difficulties of the underdeveloped economies.
The State has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
In the country, isolated nomad tribes of hunters-gatherers live in the deserts, who in one way or another must be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
The integration of people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: like any country in the world, it faces the effects of climate change.
Namibia, however, has not thought to give up, but it is addressing the challenges it faces.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities began to build a diverse economy and a united society.
Notably, rival political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides low-cost health care not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of visitors to health-care facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about a wall that separates the country from poor and corrupt neighbours.
The Namibians realized that they didn't choose their neighbours, so they decided not to fight with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional health projects, to encourage investment, and to exchange students.
In addition, the Namibian Government has rightly reasoned that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, helping to enrich the few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that Namibia ' s natural wealth should be invested in infrastructure and productive capacities.
They also realize that it would be irresponsibly not to try to maximize the profit from the country ' s resources, and are reviewing investment laws and contracts to make sure it is.
Transparentness is critical to this process, so the Government ' s strong support for free speech is so important.
As Head of State Hage Gaingob has pointed out, the media often say things they don't like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia has to protect the freedoms it has, says the President.
Not all Namibia ' s key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, were renewables, and the Government was making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country every year.
Namibia has shown that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings - racism, colonization, inequality and low levels of development - can find the way to common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and emulation.
Many have heard of Varna's Gold, the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 B.C.E.).
Perhaps it was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, when the Necropolis was dug up, a fantastic number of golden artifacts was found -- more than 3,000 to a total weight of 6 kg.
Only 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg have been extracted from one grave, known as "Mobile No. 43".
However, the official status of the world’s oldest gold can soon move on to the non-noticed bead found by archaeologists in July this year.
Again in Bulgaria, a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yuncite.
In contrast to Varna, a port city, Tell Yunacite is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunacite of the Pasarjik district.
The bead is a golden streak rolled in a ring.
Javor Bojadjiyev, head of excavation at Tella Yuncite, dated the discovery in 4600 B.C.E. and declared that she was at least 200 years older than Varna's gold.
The treasures of Varna, again, date from about the same period, from 4600 to 4,200 B.C.E.
There is currently no technology to date the metal with an impeccable accuracy.
How can we be sure of what gold is more ancient?
Apparently, Professor Bojadjiev knows more than he told the Reuters agency, "I'm pretty sure the gold is older than Varna's."
It's a find of extreme importance: it's kind of a small object, but it's big enough to take the right place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Bojadjiyev, scientists will soon analyse the composition of the metal, as well as re-examine the archaeology, where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bead as precisely as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell Yuncite is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Tell Yuncite is now considered the oldest city in Europe.
Tell was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium B.C.E.
Over the next centuries, the region has been in a state of rocky metal processing, from the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the national history of this archaeological community, there is a special name: the Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium B.C., urban-type settlements began to emerge around the metalworking centres.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yuncite may be the oldest, as the artifacts of 4,900 B.C.E. were found here.
I'd call Tell Yuncite a modern city, though it's a very old settlement, even in comparison to Mesopotamia.
"This place is thousands of years older than Schumer," says Bojadjiyev, in view of the common belief that urban culture was born in South Mesopotamia, a modern-day Iraq.
It was the first city to come up in a common sense of the word.
It has been excavated since 1976.
In that time, archaeologists dug up almost 12 acres, about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The rest of the fortress wall was found once up to three meters high.
There is little left of houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish the streets, public buildings, urban dense development, business center, and outskirts.
Tell Yuncite is often called Bird City, where dozens of earthy shapes of birds have been found.
All the birds were pictured in a state of rest, so it was assumed that they were not decorative objects, but a subject of local worship.
The Bird City was demolished about 4100 B.C., possibly by Indo-European tribes from the north-east.
Nomads had no towns, but horses and guns.
The three-metre fortresses didn't stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of a brutal slaughter: the remains of old men, women and children, with traces of axes, have been found inside the homes.
New discoveries and new facts emerge every year, altering the way we view the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking, not about individual cultures, but about the “lost” first civilization of Europe, born in the Balkans.
The “Gold of Varna, ” found relatively recently in 1972, was a powerful incentive to search for this civilization.
Logically, Varna's golden luxury was to precede something - a sort of tiny golden bead created in Telle Yuncite.
In Porsche, the 911 Targa model was man-made.
It has been officially stated that the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is manually trained by a unit working with serial machines.
The "Retro-Luck" is, for example, in the special color of the Etna Blue body, which was developed as early as 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, which is even the color of the model logo.
In addition, the Targa received a custom white chart along the sideboards and a special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel drive, as well as some parts of the bodywork, painted in a white-gold metal.
In the interior of the retro-chunks, it is much smaller: it differs, in large terms, in the sero-blue gamma of design, in new seats with extended ranges of electrical adjustment, and in separate black anodized steel with the unit logo.
In addition, when a special version is bought, each buyer will receive a car bag and a rich, separate album with photographs of the production process.
The Porsche Exclusive power plant is not to touch the steels: the retro-targ is very similar to the series.
It is equipped with a turbocharged six-cylinder motor of 3.0 l, which is developing 420 h and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released with a limited printout, but neither the volume nor the cost of each particular sports car will be reported.
Facebook and the ad blockers set up an arms race.
The recent introduction of Facebook, which has prevented social media ads from being hidden, has prompted decision-makers to block retaliatory ads.
The AdBlock Plus has released an antidote, but Facebook is about to make it worthless.
So the AdBlock Plus has prophesied its new technology, which is likely to be effective for a short time.
Social media representatives noted that, in an effort to defraud new “unlocked” advertising technology, the decision from AdBlock Plus, along with commercial ads, is blocking many of the regular posts from friends or pages.
On Facebook, they deplored this AdBlock Plus policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to a source among the social media developers of TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop will be ready within hours.
So the social network and the blockers set up a sort of "arms race", trying to beat each other, and the affected side was the users who missed the interesting records from their friends or saw the ads where they weren't used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of the blocking of advertising in recent times have given rise to a heated debate.

Dongfeng will bring Fengguang 370 to Russia, and Rich New's pickup, at www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a member of China's increasingly popular car class, which combines the merit of a minivan with a crossover.
The Ritch New pickup was another Russian primer.
Many Western firms of the Moscow International Automobile this year decided to ignore, so the emptiness of the Crocus Expo exhibition halls will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, a strong front will be Dongfeng Motor, a company with large sizes on the Russian market, and will in the near future offer to our auto-lovers a number of interesting new things.
One of them will be a Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossroads, sold in China this spring at a cost of 55,900 yuan (a little less than 550,000 roubles at the current rate).
The Russians are unlikely to see such a price and the issue of transfers to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 was able to get to number 11 on the list of top-selling minivans, although due to the high road eclipse (175 mm) and the protective plastic sheathing on the lower perimeter of the body, it can well be ranked as a crosscarryer.
Crosswen is built on the Fengguang 360, 370 has the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is a bit longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon was decorated with wooden bars, but the picture of the big vertical touch screen "like the Tesla" on the central console was only on the early exposition of the cross-venture, and the car was sold with a simpler "music".
Five of the seven landing sites are easy to add, creating a level loading area of 1650 mm, with a maximum boot volume of 1500 litres.
The engine for Fengguang 370 is only one-and-a-half-litre petrol "atmosphere" with a capacity of 115 h, combined with a 5-stage mechanical gearbox.
The dynamic quality of the machine is quietly concealed by the manufacturer, but the owner's budget-sparing appetite is 6.7 l/100 km.
The Rich New pickup is well-known to the Russians, the Nissan NP300 Navara of the last generation, but with a bit of Chinese style design.
Despite the morally outmoded design, this model still enjoys a stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a trustworthy and unfavorable workhorse.
At a similar price, Rich New will be interested in the Russians, as modern Japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines for choice: a 2.4-litre petrol (137 lc) or a 2.5-litre turbodies (116 lc).
The gearbox is only a mechanic, the drive is to the rear wheel, but there are modifications with a rigidly-connected "front".
It will be on the Dongfeng stand and the new A9 flagman sedan, and its Russian prime office of the Chinese firm was announced in June.
Minveno-like crossovers on the Chinese market are on the rise, and one of the latest is Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
The current Russian line of Dongfeng is made up of two models: S30 sedan and H30 Cross hatchback.
In the seven months of this year, Chinese dealers made 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax alerts will stop posting - www.zr.ru
The tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for issuing notices of property taxes.
All Russian motorowners have become accustomed to a pattern that has not changed over the years: in the summer and the fall, they receive an e-mail ticket to pay the previous year's transport tax.
This year, however, many of them will not be able to wait.
The fact is that the tax inspection has changed the way in which citizens are notified.
For those who are registered with the Tax Payer's Personal Office on the official website of the agency nalog.ru, the notices will be sent in electronic form.
In the inspection, such Russians were automatically considered to be online users and erased from the standard, "paper" mailing.
The news will cover all owners of vehicles and real property.
The rest of us will still get the usual letters.
In fact, there is a way to get back to the old setup, and it is also possible for the owner of the account on the site.
To do so, they will have to visit the tax office during the month of August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more comfortable.
The notice will appear in the "personal office" as soon as it is completed, while the letter will go for a few days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of the tax inspectorate has overstretched 18 million people, which will enable the agency to save a lot of money on the mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly not enough to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some may have registered in a private office for a one-time service and have forgotten it a long time ago.
These people will not wait to be notified by mail, and without knowing it, they will fall into the category of defaulters, with all the consequences.
The “Personal Office of the Tax Payer” is accessible in three ways: through the account of the portal gosuslugi.ru, by means of an electronic signature, or by means of the login and passphrase specified in the record card.
The last one can be obtained in person from any branch of the tax inspectorate (whether or not).
We recall that this year the transport tax must be paid by 1 December.
The distribution of the notices began in July.
The Mercedes-Benz G-Class tube, which is designed to achieve very high returns, is one thing in itself.
But the debatable concept didn't confuse G-Power's masters, who got to change the Mercedes-AMG G63 sports version.
The G-Power is known for his addiction to BMW cars, but nothing is human to her masters.
In fact, why not improve the G 63 to 571-strong flyer sled with tank aerodynamics and up to a hundred in 5.4 s?
By inflating the "muscles" of the crazy "gelic," the master took advantage of the 5,5-litre supercharged "8."
But the rate of up to a hundred has improved by the indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "kirpich" is able to leap for a 5,3 s.
But he's probably getting a lot better at the middle speeds.
The speed cap is frightening: if standard G 63 is not moving faster than 210 km/h, a tubed all-road with a deactivated electronic collar can reach 250 km/h.
On the outside, the car is almost indistinguishable from its plant source, with the exception of other wheel drives - 23-inch Hurricane RR size 30535 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach luxurious segment announced a six-metre-long conceptual coupe, which will be presented at the Pebble Beach Elegance Contest.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the "green subbrand" of BMW i and will promote its electrical models under a separate trade mark.
A minimum of four green new developments are expected in the coming years.
