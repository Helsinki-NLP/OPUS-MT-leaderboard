Parliament does not support an amendment giving Tymoshenko freedom
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in the course of the amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure, has rejected an attempt to repeal an article that condemned the leader of the opposition, Julia Timoschenko.
The amendment, which would result in the release of the former Prime Minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on commutation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be unprofitable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will hear the Tymoshenko appeal in December.
Tymoshenko claims that the sentence is the political revenge of the regime; in the West, the process has also been suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, under which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to ratify it.
The Victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or insurrection, Libya is already a loser.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert, and the war is over without him.
The time has come to identify the victors.
In general, Islamists win the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the regular Sharia Act, of which we have already heard.
Libya will become a country free from crime, as the penalty for stealing is a hand-association.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and which we would hardly wish for.
In any event, our way of life is neither one of a kind nor the best, and it is not likely that the people of Libya, for example, would be.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamist militants have accepted help from non-believers.
Their only excuse is that, in their view, the attack by NATO was not led by an American general, but by God, whose majesty they glorified after every blow.
And if in Libya we look for victors, the West is not among them.
We have been involved in the fighting, we have served Islam, and our politicians have been rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantee of profit.
In view of the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to give up the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, has no need to worry about the banishment of the “crusaders”.
Although, without occupation, would the oil companies get the black gold of Libya for almost no cost?
Probably not, and then the West can finally brag about the unselfish protection of civil rights.
Unless Sharia's followers put an end to it.
A new wave of crisis is under way.
France and the rest of Europe are now the focus of the investment.
The statistical storm swept over Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries released data on GDP in the third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a state of stagnation, with Germany and France showing growth.
Still, the debt market today has a record.
Investors are no longer just looking to Italy; they are now focused on Spain, France, Austria, and others.
The eurozone statistical offices in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have made their preliminary economic development estimates public in the third quarter.
Germany ' s GDP rose by the expected 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
The two countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany was doing better than expected (an increase of 0.3 per cent instead of the original 0.1 per cent). France reported a small decrease of 0.1 per cent (the initial information was stagnating).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a pre-growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, as compared to the previous quarter, GDP was in a state of stagnation, which, according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, confirmed the trend of slowing down economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts predicted.
Key Events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a pre-growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
On the basis of pre- and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, both the eurozone and the European Union have shown an increase of 0.2 per cent over the previous quarter, which is the same as the analysts.
The Greek economy has shown a preliminary drop of 5.5%.
Its 10-year-old bond yields 28,45%.
The revenue of both Italian and Spanish bonds is nearing a critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to face difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the profitability of Czech 1-year-old bonds remains at about 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is said to be the last lender to save the situation.
The Czechs have been selected by EURO.
In Montenegro, they win with a 1:0 score and celebrate an unexpected 200 million-dollar prize.
The national team has successfully met the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the excellent Czech and the beautiful voice of Peter Jirachek, they won at 1:0.
In the second half, the Czech team was able to retain a significant advantage after a home-grown return match, and it will be re-introduced in the European Cup.
IHNED.cz has been watching the match and has prepared a detailed report.
It's almost nothing in the first half, and it's a lot of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, due in part to the loss of the team at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Jirachek; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the European Cup.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the Montenegrin team to create dangerous moments in the second half of the game.
Damianovic and Vucinich were the worst match ever, after they missed two grand opportunities.
The brilliant Peter Chech is one of the reasons the Czech national team won't miss the European Cup next year, and the Czech football will make up about 200 million Czech kroner.
From the first moment, the game was very stressful.
The two teams had difficulty in running the combinations; the game was in the center of the field for most of the time.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the hosts' team in the first half of the time, and the long-range strikes over the line of defense were carefully intercepted by the Czech defence counsel.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred university students created a human shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
In so doing, they want to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday at noon, the student ' s prayers in front of the building were followed by a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, a number of hundreds of university students created a human shield around the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Factory.
In this way, they have shown a willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme at the cost of their own life.
In its most recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that it was clear that Iran had not forsaken an attempt to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday, at noon, student prayers in front of the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Plant were followed by prayers for both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at the maximum paralysis of Iran ' s nuclear programme, the Israeli press has indicated that the targets will be both in Isfahan and in Natanz, where uranium is being enriched.
Obesity: No breakfast and no sausage for supper
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight; while 9 per cent are overweight, 5 per cent are obese.
According to a recent study, obese children usually come from unhealthy families.
Once again, we see the importance of the environment and the patterns of conduct accompanying man for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausage is almost twice as common on the table of obese children as it is in families with normal weight.
More than 19% of obesity-affected children ate fries for dinner on the eve of an educational event called Obesity is not an accident.
In fact, the families of obese children do not engage in sports; this, however, is the case for most of the families of modern schoolteachers - only 15 per cent of the children say that their parents find time to engage in sports at least once a week.
The study was carried out among 900 children.
The study was carried out at the end of the last school year, with the participation of almost 900 primary students throughout Bohemian.
The Obesity Event was not an incident for the second year in a row, with the support of Všeobecná zdravotní pojišovna and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 students from 4 to 8 grades have joined the project.
Good diet and sufficient sporting burden are the main determinants of a rapidly growing number of children who are either overweight or obese.
"For example, only half of the interviewees said they'd eat five times a day, a lunch lunch lunch lunch lunch luncheon, and that's one of the basic conditions for proper diet," says one of the conclusions of the study.
No lunch and no sausage at night.
Experts warn that even relative details, such as permanent family lunch, are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of school-age families have breakfast together.
Most families have separate lunches.
The worst thing is, in every 10th family, people don't have breakfast at all.
Still, breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The study found that fried food is more common in families with obese children.
Almost everyone, no matter what the weight, drinks sweet, cool drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children are regularly engaged in sports, this figure is more than halved, up to 15 per cent, when it comes to their parents.
Set up your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to draw up their own menus on the basis of the products offered and on the basis of their tastes and preferences.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from the ideal of healthy diet."
Their favorite food includes a large number of flour, meat, and sweet dishes.
"A particular concern is the popularity of sweet cooling drinks," states the final part of the study.
As the main meal, the pasta won the bird with a small margin.
However, children have shown little interest in bean, fish, and vegetable dishes.
Seeking a Healthy Lifestyle
The study also found that children are ready to change their eating habits on the condition that they are provided with relevant information.
“Many members of the control group of studies have shown a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when they have completed a form of obesity is not an accident,” states the project's outcome.
This was particularly noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet, cooling beverages - more children began to prefer them to just water.
In addition, as a main dish, children were more likely to mark a bird and a fish, limiting the number of sweet dishes and baking.
Stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals.
In my first article on stylers training, I visited the volume of information in introductory classes.
I had no idea what was next.
Lectures by three experts in this field; advice on the choice of dress for non-standard characters; and a seminar on how this works in real life.
Next, more.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical assignments we expect.
Training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really full of information.
This time, with Alenka, the headmaster, (no man in class) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not ideally symmetrical.
Most women are not fully symmetrical.
One has a short neck, the other has a boy's figure without proper shape, and another weighs more than normal.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce the wide shoulders, extend the neck, or add the missing volumes.
We've been given advice on how to stress the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, i.e., women with a bigger boob and hips and a narrow waist, while not dressing them too repulsive.
For example, if the size of a waist and a hip is so big that you can't pick up a skirt or a trouser, you have to have at least one custom-made thing.
You will certainly not regret the investment, for the ideally seated clothes are priceless.
In a custom-made skirt, you're gonna feel a lot better than the one that's always moving out, rolling up, barking up a waist, etc.
On the other hand, girls who possess a boy can wear dresses with rups, appliance, embroidery or folding.
In view of the abundance of such information and the type of shapes, I'm glad I have a week to get to know all this.
And yet, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we got.
Each student needed to come up with two dresses for a celebrity: a day and a night.
We have to take into account their modern appearance, their style of dress, and the type of shape.
I've got to put on a Miranda Kerr that you might know on Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm happy about myself, because it's a lot easier to put on than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently recovered a ton (please bear in mind I'm exaggerating), or a very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut out the clothes from the magazines or find it online, print out and process it with graphics.
The Mudboard, so called the result of the work, then reflects our own style and the way we view the graphic picture.
It's important to keep the graphics of style in mind.
The stylist not just dresses real people, but creates groceries in magazines (based on specific instructions, such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us about.
But it was only Sunday.
Stylist Needs Common Knowledge
The Saturday lecture, full of information about the type of figure, was revived by three visitors, who were experts in the field.
Stylist, Honza Pocorny; fashion designer, Yakub Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing in a different way.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, you can wear your coat-wraith in a normal way, over your jeans and t-shirts like your coat; but you can also wear it on your naked body, without clapping like a dress.
The other option is to roll up your sleeves or raise your collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"Play with it," he stressed.
In any event, I am most appreciative of the following advice: "For your work, you must know the rules ideally."
Then you can start breaking 'em,' said Jacob.
Here I finally figured out why we're putting together all the definitions and rules, what to do with what and why, while in fashion magazines, we often see something very different.
Not to mention fashion show.
From Ben, the photographer, I found out that the stylist should be ready with more design options than the number of photographs he needed to take.
So for a fashion view on 10 pages (equivalent to 10 dresses), I have to be ready to make at least 15 images.
Now I also know that in the picture, the object of clothing often looks and works in combination with others in a very different way than in the real world.
We have to keep this in mind when we make an image.
Honsa Obedience has confirmed that often image and style are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an astonishing voice, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards the services of the stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even well-known people often think it's superfluous (and they think it's enough to be a specialist in something, and what they look like is secondary).
And if someone finally lets us make their style, we have to expect them to call us a different (lower) size than what they actually wear.
Then we go to Google and see if the tabloids have written anything about some celebrity fat/dead, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario focused on the fact that fashion is not enough for a stylist to be able to pick up a dress.
Our job is basically to talk to the people we dress; so it's important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to condone them and to hold their opinions.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add a few pretty things, you can't dump all her wardrobe, telling her her her clothes are terrible."
"Find at least a few things you can commend, and suggest that you can wear with them," says Mario.
He also showed us that he should specifically include the work bag.
This is a bag you bind around your waist to wear everything you need.
In addition to the obvious things, such as scissors, sticky rollers, or English pins, it should have a nylon thread (stylists use it to film certain items, such as bags or hats), special clips to bind the tissue on the back in the event that the clothes are too big (bubbles and similar items are not allowed because they spoil the clothes) or a sewing kit.
In order to get away from the lectures and get some practical experience, we've learnt to do the right stuff on the soles of the boots.
Even in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can be damaged, not to mention on the street.
So we got to do the sticker.
You don't have to touch your shoes with scissors so you don't ruin them.
This requires real skill.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
I didn't like the skills mentioned.
That's just part of what we heard in the second part of the weekend class.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn't that easy to say.
V Need for Speed: The run is in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a careless walk has become a routine morning trip to work due to a series of total misplaced and careless mistakes.
Ambitions have been met to a certain extent, but it doesn't matter, as no one has clearly wanted to do any extra work.
Before the new version with the subtitle "Flug" went out, there was a lot of hope.
It was expected to move the previous "Ned For Speed" series in a new direction; the showcases indicated that the game would take a proper place in the genre of the race.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main character got out of the car and ran.
As is often the case with NFS, in the end, much is different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the general impression has been eroded by a number of unnecessary errors that have been present in this series of games for a number of years.
So, in fact, it's not a mistake, it's an inexplicable laziness of the developers.
The adventure is starting very well.
You're part of a history whose main character, Jack, solves some personal problems by taking part in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast in San Francisco, and it's your job to get to New York first.
This design has a number of interesting features.
The route consists of 10 steps, divided by more than 50 races.
This means that every race goes on its own path, and the individual stages go on in a diverse and interesting environment.
So it doesn't feel like the game is the same all the time.
Although the charts are at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, it is a pleasure to look at some of the tracks.
Still, the game does not give rise to strong emotions.
While driving through the desert, in the fall suburbs, or high in the snowy mountains, it is very enjoyable.
Plus, the race is a time-to- time-to-time life-enabling feature.
In the desert, for example, you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces the visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to get under a hole.
The individual races are fairly well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while, you're trying to outrun a few rivals (in fact, a normal race); then you're trying to improve the time (standard race with a stopwatch); or you're competing with one adversary.
Among other things, you run into the police from time to time, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation, where most of the time Jack is running away from someone and you have to help him by clicking on the right buttons at the right time.
It's not a big deal.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much less than you would expect (just three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that it's good for a game, because it's not boring; given all the above, it's one of the things that makes the game more fun.
The race model follows the tracks of previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be viewed as a disadvantage.
If you're looking for a real life imitation, you're gonna have to look elsewhere.
Still, this model of driving is very good for a dynamic race, though there are better options on the market.
So far, so good.
But after a while, problems start.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
You don't expect a game like this to make a lot of changes and collisions, but if you don't have any idea how your car will act, something's wrong.
Normally, bypassing or bypassing a car in a dense stream, you sometimes touch another car a bit, but sometimes, in a very similar situation, your car starts to spin wildly.
Or it's been crushed.
It's not that important because of the restart system, but it's enough to ruin the fun.
The re-starts are designed so that if you break up or go far off the track, the game brings you back to the point where it was interrupted.
However, there are only five re-starts available for each race.
If you use all of them, you're gonna have to start the race from the start.
It's good if something doesn't work out, but you can't rely on it.
Sometimes re-starting is not enough, and you have to memorize a separate section of the race.
An important shortcoming of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some twists have to go in a certain way, or you just don't fit in.
In other cases, you meet a civilian car in a particular location in the same configuration, whether you come first, fifth, five seconds earlier, or a minute later.
This is particularly frustrating in situations where you see your opponent moving easily between two cars moving in the opposite direction, while when you get there, the machines are already positioned in such a way that you need to either cross them or drop the speed.
It doesn't matter when you're next to them; it's like it's always happening in front of you.
The opponents have other advantages.
During the game, you find a number of places where, no matter what time, the same rival overtakes you in the same place.
This is particularly evident at the end of the game, on a long bridge, where you go in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand up to you no matter what.
The thing is, when he's on his way to you, he's making you look worse, leading to one or more accidents in this section.
You can see an attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's starting to get irritated fast.
It's a pity, because despite the simple model of driving, the game is fun, and sometimes so full of events, you don't have time to look at what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter what makes you miss -- a concept with fifty unique tracks, a sequential race or something.
The idea of changing cars during the race is unusual.
You need to track the gas stations on the way, because that's where your car can trade, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is quite enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sporting machines are good for cities; powerful American cars are good for direct highways; and exotic super-sports for technical driving, for example, on bending mountain tracks.
The main mode of story mode is closely linked to the challenge mode; it is a race on individual plots that you will learn during the game.
Here you win for your personal business, both medals and glasses common to challenges and story.
Many options are available to obtain a higher level of driving, from the car to the profile data.
In addition, the profile is related to the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with those of other players, and provides public relations.
Here's another flaw that's hard to understand; it's an example from the last race in a sequential fashion.
You and your car get into the subway tunnel (let's think so), where you run down the rails in the dark (let's think so).
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (let's say so) when a subway train suddenly hits you from behind, transforming your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For a few days, our editors have been talking about whether, at the time of the game's creation, no one really thought for a second, or whether its creators really think we're such idiots.
The technical content of the game is not a big deal; but the overall impression from the video series is mostly nice, sometimes even fabulous.
Although it is a pity that at some critical moments the quality of the record is sometimes very much down.
This is particularly true of the events with a large number of participants, where a good record would not be very helpful to you, too.
Sound's in order; soundtrack's on the amateur.
In order to please as wide a youth audience as possible, the soundtrack's "smart from different styles"; but it's not likely that a lot of people will buy a game because of her music.
The general impression of Need for Speed: The run is rather messy.
If the game were to avoid obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that the run is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
In any event, the game leaves a sense of incompleteness.
Of course, it's a good fun, but get ready to see your inadequacies blind you as a spotlight at the airport.

Ambassador to the EU, Witzenova:
The Czechs have a reputation for wanters and skeptics vis-à-vis the euro.
"The Lissabona Treaty has given rise to major differences between individual organizations."
"I didn't expect such a brutal war."
"It takes five or six years before the situation is at all stabilized, calmed down, and all the players get used to their new roles," the EU ambassador, Milena Vicenov, began his lecture in law.
She has shown the extent to which her motto, “Embark and Open Europe,” has been followed in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and the relationship between them so easily and clearly, that many lecturers from the School of Law would be envious.
In fact, Vicenov commended the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
"At first, the critics said he was just a grey office mouse who can't play any role; I have to say, everyone was amazed how well he did his role."
"He is a man who can listen at the same time to the twenty-seven member countries, who is well-connected with them, and who has a clear idea of which way to develop the EU."
She explained her new position as a representative for international relations and security as an answer to the question, "Who is the European Union, which number do I need to call?", an important step towards unifying and more transparent Union policies on countries such as China or India.
No one's gonna ban our cheeses.
Vicenova went on to focus on a program key to the EU in the past, the present and the near future.
She called the successful Czech presidency the previous year.
The Czechs have been dealing with an impending financial crisis; they have overcome the crisis and have organized an Eastern Partnership summit.
She said that the Government’s resignation at the time was a negative phenomenon that had caused a great deal of harm to the Czech Republic.
The Czech representatives in the EU are currently very busy.
As the Ambassador has said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have led to an ongoing setback.
In addition, a new seven-year EU budget needs to be adopted, which is very difficult in view of the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be meagre and cost-effective, which areas would be preferred; which countries would receive more support and which countries would receive less; all of those issues would be in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels: “O Europe, in a clear language”.
"I really don't like shortcuts, foreign words, and jargon, which no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels, people don't try to sell crooks or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone's gonna ban our kind of cheese.'
It also intends to make better use of the EU environment and to attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe - Our Future
The Ambassador states that the Czechs are considered to be Euro-skeptic, as well as people who point out the negative rather than the positive side of things.
She wanted more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that there are a number of factors behind this: for example, the modestness of our candidates and their failure to write the motivating letters; and a small support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, it noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and the Slovak joins us, the French next to me say, "Hey, what's the meeting about, the Visegrad band again?" And he's not a bit happy about it.
In the future, the Union of Wizenov is looking for, for the most part, new strict rules for the budgetary policies of the States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considered the idea of a two-speed, if not multi-speed, Europe to be more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside the eurozone. "
"We have a Schengen zone, and we already have an institution of intensive co-operation."
"For the first time, it was said that the countries that want to unite, while those who don't want to stay away."
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a real two-speed Europe," awaits Vizenov.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in advancing the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all member countries, not just the eurozone.
Mark history:
IBM's innovator is entering the second century of his existence.
If anyone wants to find a word that best expresses an IMB strategy, the closest thing to it is probably "long-term."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered to be very modern, even though it was founded over a century ago.
The company's longevity was laid down by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson, Sr.
He believed in his motto, according to which many of the world's problems can be solved easily if people want to think.
His slogan, "Think!", was the image of the future giant (and the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began to publish in 1935).
In fact, it was the basis of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means a constant move to the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because it was true to its original values, though it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first 100 years, this has enabled us to transform technology, business, and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to do more,” says Samuel J. Palmizano, the current head of the company, on the occasion of the Jubilee.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of care for employees as Batia in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, insurance from the employer, elegant uniforms, and a complex system of bonuses for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The long-term IBM-consumer relationship is just as advanced.
From the start, the company found brilliant use of talented people, one of the first global companies to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it a great choice.
Concurs with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, according to which a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She worked for IBM for 30 years; she is currently the Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
For the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorming, in which many future innovations emerge.
No wonder there's a lot of ideas - there's about half a million people in the company.
A well-reputed organization
The company's strong position in the business is a strong internal and external image.
"From the start, from the point of view of the IBM concept, was more an organization than a technology company," said the economist Professor at Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a tech company, it's a company that's helping to solve business problems with the use of technology," adds George Colony from the Forrester Research Consulting Company.
As the company itself has said, there is a difference between going to the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or "Blue Giant", as it is called in the United States, has become one of the world's largest companies.
It seems to be the most universal technology company -- hardware and software development; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services -- from servers to nanotechnologies.
She owns the highest number of patents in all US tech companies, and five of her employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a bar code and a diskette.
With $220 billion in market capitalization, IBM this year became the second-largest technology company (the first in Apple) to outrun Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look Forward
Not all of its products tasted like buyers and fit into the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online; and IBM PCjr.
"If your business is driven by the way forward, you can't be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM is easy to base on multiple platforms - if they don't work, it's not.
This differs, for example, from its Microsoft competitor, who is based on and is experiencing a fall on Windows, his operating system.
Prospect technology
IBM's main revenue is from services, and about one-fifth in each case is from computer software and hardware.
While in 1990 the capital was half the size, it was the best manufacturing company in the world.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth $15 billion, while at the same time it has invested 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of his first director, Thomas J. Watson, who has increased the number of investments during the Great Depression.
Until IBM seems to have harmed the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM shares has risen by record 120 per cent; the company's net earnings have continued to rise.
The corporate motto of IBM is to change everything but its own values.
So we can expect that even if another crisis erupts, this flexible giant will deal with the situation.
IBM history, from a raw knife to a space flight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a century ago, and its original name, "Creation, Tabulation, Recording Corporation", was rather complex.
It was named IBM in 1924, the original name of the brand used for Canada and South America.
The base of the future IBM was a merging of four companies, the history of which began in the 1880s.
They owned technology, such as the legendary watch, that is, a watch that fixes the time when the staff come and go out of work.
The architect of the new company was a businessman, Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also head of the company's board of trustees until 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, the head of a rival company, to help him run the company.
The manager then put the founder of IBM in the shadows - Watson's ideas remain the basis of a solid corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as it is clear from the name, began with the production and sale of various business equipment, from raw knives and carvings to cashiers.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, the proceeds doubled to $9 million, and a massive expansion of the company to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that after almost 40 years his son, Thomas Watson Jr., took his place in the director's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA to control space flights - to Mercure, Saturn, and in 1969 - a man to the moon.
In the meantime, IBM developed the first family of computers in 1964, the IBM line system/360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of the time, IBM 5150, was introduced on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to a Chinese company, Lenovo, while at the same time buying a consulting office, PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus focusing entirely on consulting and high value-added services.
In the last three years, IBM has made great progress with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to make sound use of technology in areas where it has not yet been planned, and to improve the road and urban management.
In commerce, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commons platform, which assists businessmen in controlling the entire trade cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, the first country to be located in central and eastern Europe, IBM founded its office in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also runs a strategic outsource center in Brno.
Central and Eastern Europe is headquartered in Prague, where a world-level study group is also working on the recognition of speech.
Richtarchova about his unfaithful husband:
Yvette, keep the fool, I don't need it any more!
Darina Richterjova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Joseph Richter (53) became the bodyguard and lover of Yvette Bartoshov (45), Darina still hoped he would wake up and return home.
Still, she no longer wants to wait, and she has set clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can go home, but not as my partner," Rikhtarzhov explained.
When Darina Richterjov made the bed of Bartoshov at her home in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And even though she made Yvette leave Rizjan after 30 days, Pepa didn't leave the singer.
In fact, he publicly confessed to love her.
After a while, Darina gave up, pretending to accept her husband's affair; and now she finally forgave him.
Richter doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with.
Even if Richter and Bartoshov ever break up, his wife won't take him with an open hug.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one's gonna kick him out."
"But he will end his days not as my favorite, lost and found old fool, but as the man with whom I have something to do with," said Richtersov, adding that she has already been freed from her husband and insists on both decency.
So far, Joseph has nothing against his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm gonna be with Yvette, I'm not gonna change it."
"My wife has decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect this decision."
"Our union is still in operation; I am in charge of repair, orchard, house, and shopping."
"Darina and I are talking perfectly normal, but we don't share the bed any more," said Richter to Blask.
He claims that if he finds a new love, he won't stop her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she has, and if she has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yvette, and I bear full responsibility," concluded Joseph.
Worse women's habits: Do they touch you?
When you ask men to name some typical bad women's habits, they tend to list them all at once.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the next line, describing a number of women's habits that make men mad?
Shopping
Your other soulmate complains you go shopping all the time?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping on big sales?
If so, your shopping is a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their shopping passion somehow.
And yet, which one of you would not want to go shopping for a perfect seated dress and try it on (preferably in different colors) in the dressing room?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but it can be a hell for men.
Just remember how many times you told your mate to wait outside...
Eternal Dissatisfaction
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos. Maybe I should start doing gymnastics."
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you know those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you're part of a group of women who are obsessive about their appearance.
Not that you need to stop watching yourself, but many men are literally allergic to persistent partner complaints about their appearance.
The strong gender also agrees that the more frequent such complaints are, the more women irritate them.
The most important thing is order and purity.
It's like an endless story.
Glass washing, vacuum cleaning, floor washing, dust cleaning, bath cleaning - at least twice a week.
You're criticizing your partner for coming to a clean cafe in filthy boots, kids for dirt in a clean sink, and fingerprints on a window in the living room, which was so hard to clean?
If you are suffering from this “rejection, ” try to realize that it is not right to go to extremes; and that order and purity should not be the first place in your family.
A harmless pursuit of cleanliness can threaten your relationship as well as your entire family.
Strive to command
"Throw your underwear in the basket."
"Are you gonna wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet dish towels should not lie on the floor."
If you comment on your partner a few times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want it to be perfect.
Maybe if men had understood that, women wouldn't have to command them so much...
Gossipulations
Some women like to gossip, insult, and intrigue others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to talk about who, who, who, how, and why.
From time to time, I think we're all gossiping.
Let's be frank, that's the nature of all women.
In any event, there are more serious gossipers, women, who often gossip and despise others, who, especially in the working group of women, pose a great danger to their environment.
The results of the Yagra and the Doctor's show helped Philadelphia win.
During the NHL game on Monday, two successful showbacks of hockey attacker Jaromir Yagra helped Philly win 5:3 on the Ice of Carolina, and he again became the most effective Czech player in the game.
In both cases, Claude Giroux used the experience of a 30-year-old star; he added another show and was declared the best player in the game.
The two performances of the match also belonged to the Yagob Jakub Doctoreka team.
After the match, the Jagres told the foreign reporters that he had predicted a great evening for Gira.
"I told him before the match he'd hit the hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel such things," the Jagre, after whose actions Geiro scored a goal at the first chance Flyers gave.
A little later, the team's second goal also had a "black track."
Locking Harrikanes Voraschek took over the puck and handed it over to Maxim Talbot, who was slaughtered between the circles.
A second before the first break, the home player Patrick Dwyer narrowed the gap with a multiple advantage, but at the start of the second half, the Flyers again led.
Especially Giroux.
After Yagra's performance, he scored a third goal; his next hit was turned into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with it."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," said the Jagr, commending his center.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years at the NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now it's my turn," he added.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with Tuomo Ruutu and Dwyer's penny, narrowing it down to one goal.
Further complications prevented Matt Reid, who widened the gap to two points.
"Proger was doing great in our zone."
"He hit the puck, I hastened, and Reed went to the far end."
"I was aiming at it and I'm glad it worked," described my impression from the last goal of the match.
The win put Philadelphia at the top of the Eastern Conference.
Protector of the Montreal team, Jaroslav Spachek, failed to complete the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to an injury to the upper body.
With an experienced defender, Canada lost its two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of penalties.
Tomasz Plykanski was not able to kill in one of their attacks.
More than the lost glasses, the home coach was saddened by the number of injuries in the back row, as the match was over with only five defence counselors.
"The situation is bad."
"We finished the match with one experienced player, the rest of us were young men."
"Either way, there's nothing we can do about it, we just have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement, it was astonishing and we couldn't resist."
"We needed to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone."
"What was our weak side," added P.K. Soebban's defender
After 30 attacks, the Czech holkepper Onjay Pavel was able to help Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Jets’ goals, which interrupted the five-way series of defeats, were slaughtered by five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Prior to 1989, only five state travel agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: Šedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea, and Autotourist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, the travel agencies of the time were mostly selling tours to the socialist bloc.
As a result, on vacation Czech tourists went to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea, on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was from 1962 to 1972, when we were able to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, which led to considerable restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
A major paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to make individual trips to socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovakia national wanted to go on his own, such as to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation was needed from that country; otherwise, an individual journey was not possible.
At the time, travel agencies offered to go to the West, but either needed to be in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or to have "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
Currency permission was needed to travel to the West, and it was not given to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; it was not possible to get the money (Western currency) to go to the West without a currency permit.
Most of the time, the Czechs spent their vacations at home, leading to a large number of cottages and summer homes, a habit that still exists today.
Since 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic has thus experienced a real revolution.
While until 1989 leave to the GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our journeys, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries all over the world.
The great paradox, which we are no longer aware of, is that, until 1989, we were not able to visit the most popular Croatia today, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the very beginning of 1990 the need to obtain a visa to neighbouring Western European countries was eliminated, and this led to a massive wave of short trips, mostly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakia had no way of enjoying their trips to the West, and everyone wanted to go there for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists were sleeping in parks in tents, as their income at the time was short for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring in their own food (conserves, salami, etc.) in order to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech kroner, and after decades, our tourists are finally free to buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income rose, which led to another important event in about 1997.
Since 1997, the increased demand has made it possible for travel agencies to prepare regular flights by charter airlines, and in comparison with the past, air travel has become incredibly cheap by the ability to order bulk discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs didn't need a visa to go to almost all the developed worlds, except the US, which made our journeys even easier.
The next major event in the history of the post-revolution journeys took place in 2000, and the high demand has led to the historic first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have been transporting Czech tourists to warm, exotic countries, and this winter flight from the Czech Republic will take 12 exotic directions.
At present, about 100,000 Czechs are visiting exotic countries every year!
And another important event in this period, symbolizing our post-revolution development, took place in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States cancelled the need for a visa for Czech tourists, and my country has thus become a permanent member of the world's most developed countries.
For the first time in history, in 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3 per cent); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 kroner per person for the time of their leave abroad, including their cost at their destination.
The General Assembly has to pick a president, the threat of a path is coming back.
For about five months, the Czech football has not had a president, and there is a risk that Ivan Gaszek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburka on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on the rules of the election.
Without this, the voting for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Yindrich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta, and Tomasz Paclik want to head Czech football.
He left his post in June, and he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong person to take the lead in football in the future.
However, the era of Goszek once again swept football between the two houses of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became very clear on 16 September, when a new president was to be elected.
Members of the General Assembly had not come to the National House in Prague, Smychov, because the talks had been blocked, not just the electoral process.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only the legal representatives or also the officials to whom the credentials had been granted.
This point has been partially resolved since then by the recommendation of the Institute of State and the Laws, according to which representation on the basis of the powers granted is not possible.
The debate on the rules of the elections, however, is still going on.
The Executive Council has also not been very helpful, even though it has been focused on this issue in its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary.
The way in which the voting was presented has changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is, how do we go to round 3 and get out of a mess?
“The argument is whether to follow the standards or find another model,” says one of the vice-presidents of FAchR Dushan Liberty, who represents professional football in the association's office.
On the basis of the model provided for by the statute, the winner of the third round is a candidate who has received much support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to agree to a compromise - to consider a candidate with the highest number of votes in both chambers as the winner.
The Czech side insists on the condition that, in the overall percentage, the winner should be able to obtain at least two thirds of the vote.
"Then, at least, the two previous rounds would have lost their meaning; it would have completely rejected the concept of the two chambers," he said, "Freedom agrees with Moravia's argument, and it would be best not to change the rules and to vote in accordance with the existing rules.
A bit of a sudden, Tomás Paclik concurs with his opinion, although the electoral rules set out in the statute estimate that Pelta is more than the other candidates.
"I'd like the elections to be as far as possible by statute."
"I want to avoid all sorts of representational stupidity, as at the previous General Assembly," says Victoria Plzen's owner, who is for the first time a candidate; and in his remarks, he was largely opposed to Pelte.
Pelta is still an optimist.
He trusted that the new President would be known in Nimburca; he also hoped that the candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
"Emotional fermentation will be at rest after today's expected entry of the national team to the European Cup."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, people will be more cooperative," says the representative of Applenuts, who, out of the three candidates, has the most experience in football management at both the professional and regional levels.
Reichle's more tempered.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very mixed."
"This is not between Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"This can cause another breakdown in the general meeting."
"I hope common sense wins," said Reich.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some information, some of the talks took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
An additional flight, which was to be delivered, among others, to Dalibor Kuchera and Rachel to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure, and sought an alternative to transport a part of the Executive Committee to the location of the replay match.
After all, a meeting at the ministerial level, which is expected on Wednesday, can be decisive.
The Minister for Education, Youth and Sport, Joseph Dobesh, would like to see the parties to the country ' s strongest sports association come to an agreement.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; the creditworthiness of football; and a planned ČSTV common meeting with a new Czech sports directorate after Sazki's financial problems.
Paclik is in the presidential struggle because he doesn't see the right candidate.
If, prior to the Extraordinary General Assembly, the head of the player Plzen Tomasz Paclik would have seen a strong candidate who would have met all his requirements for the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have even claimed a high office.
"If there was a decent candidate, I'd fight for it and I didn't do it myself."
"But no such man has yet been found," said Paclik ŠTK.
Paclik's motive to fight against Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Reich is to try to stop Pelte, the alleged favor of the election, from joining the FAchR office.
In fact, Paclik stresses that if he wins, he will not be president until 2013, when the next General Assembly is scheduled.
In the future, he'd like this post to be occupied by an experienced top manager, not too much to do with football life.
"I've talked to a few people who might have been in mind."
"It was terrible for me to hear some of them say, "at the moment, they don't even want to have anything to do with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that view," he said.
At present, the main disagreement between Paclik and Pelta is related to the latter's relationship with Roman Berbrom, the president of the Plzen Regional Football Association, Berber, a man of conflicting reputation, who is known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist who can influence the votes of the general assembly.
Paclik thus finds it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will not change, and football will not move forward."
"With the backing of Burber, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful to football," said Paclik.
He insinuates the fact that the name of Pelta was recorded a few years ago during a phone audition in an investigation of corruption; Pelte managed to escape the sentence.
"I don't know what the prestige of winning Pelta would bring to football."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, and he's not talking about his old saying that he'll "sell the Plzen Club if Pelta becomes president."
If Paclik wins on Thursday, he could have imagined working with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reich, who was supported by Paclik before the General Assembly in September, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I'd turn to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can introduce it to the head of the team."
"But he can't run an association."
"I don't have a nose in things I don't know about either," said Paclik, who attracted a lot of attention in September, when he supported the removal of the judicial team led by Ludec Mazela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Paclik claims he'll risk running an association.
He refers to his experience in the management of private companies; since last summer, he has run the Plzen team, which, with his help, celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the power to make the football environment change, to support it for the better."
“To limit the influence of certain groups of persons who tend to influence the disciplinary and appellate board, which leads to abhorrent situations,” said Paclik, who does not conceal his antipathy, for example, to the Director of Sparta, Daniel Krjetsky.
One of its priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it will lobby at the highest political level for more money for sports from lottery fees.
"This is one of the key things the new President has to do."
"If the taxes are on gambling, as the political parties say, I understand their argument, but they have to make it clear where the money is going," he said.
Paclik does not consider his connection to the Plzen Club to be a burden, even though he claims that the president of FAchR should be independent.
Pelta is connected to the Appleman, and Reichle is connected to the Prague Ducquela.
"That's not the ideal."
"And yet I don't see any sense in the hypocrisy of handing over my shares to the Plzen Club to someone else, if I'm gonna go back in six months," says Paclik.
Pelta has promised a new FA ChR rule to avoid Chosen Pat.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was selected, he would fight for new FA ChR rules to avoid any future disputes over the election rules.
Prior to the talks on Thursday in Nimburque, the functionary of the Applenuts remains optimistic and trusts that the focus on the election will be a major distraction to today's expected success of our football team.
Prior to the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment before the last General Assembly, so a two-month delay might have been useful to him to resist his idea of football in a wider context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the President to be known on Thursday."
"They feel it's time for someone to run an association," states a man who is mostly associated with the Jablontz Club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the Association's executive committee.
This gives him reason to believe that he's sufficiently experienced to run Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are due to the euphoria that prevailed during Ivan Gašek ' s reign.
"Unfortunately, the rules, which were not as perfect as we all thought, were adopted at the general meeting in June."
"If the different means of representation had not been adopted, we would have had a president since September," said Pelta.
He viewed the rendition of the key document of the civil association as a misguided goal for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I will take on my personal responsibility if this attempt proves to be a failure."
"This is a fundamental issue without which we can't exist," states Pelt.
In addition, he says he's not trying to single out himself against the background of his rivals.
In the past, he has stated that he can present his cooperation with Yindrich Reich, whom he values for legal education; he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidacy should be his first vice-president.
For a long time, he didn't attack Thomas Paclik, who was always critical of Pelta.
"He's been in football for over a year and he's made some success."
"Everything, his attack was indecent, and a lot of people were amazed at his campaign."
"And so some of them now question his true identity," he said about his competitor, and he himself claims to be true to the declarations he announced in September.
He's considered his main weapon to know football, from the lowest-level competition to the national team.
The national team is supposed to represent the entire football team.
"I would also try to put an end to all the incidents, starting with the Bohemian case or the consequences of last year's corruption scandal."
"After that, I would focus on negotiating with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for all the football", a 40-year-old candidate said ŠTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election as a football head would not result in the dismissal of the staff.
"I'm gonna need to know the individual employee's instructions." That was his letter to Insurance, where a long period of power is making you understandable nervous.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios associated with the planned General Assembly, he trusted that the delegates would come to Nimburk on Thursday for a reason.
"If the only question is how to hold elections in the third round, we can deal with it."
"Futball needs the trust he can only gain by finally electing his leader," says Pelta, who, two days before the key day of his career as a functionary, is still an optimist.
Reichle promises that with his leadership, FA ChR will be active.
If, at a meeting on Thursday, Jeinrich Reich, the current vice-president, is to become the president of the Czech Football Association, a lot of the people in the Association are said to be dissatisfied.
Reichle promises that if he is elected, it will be a time of hard work.
He wants to make changes in the system and make the members of the executive committee responsible for selected areas in football.
He also promises to address the problem of the Bohemians; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money to football; and to continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Gaszek.
"As President, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to the national team, professional football and football events for young people."
"That's not what I'm gonna say, I'm gonna do it all by myself," he said in his interview for ŠTK.
"I'm a team player, and I want to assign authority to the executive committee so that each member will focus on a particular area."
"I'm going to give you the task carefully so that, in each of these segments, football can take a big step forward."
"It's probably not gonna please a lot of people, because it's gonna mean hard work, not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly led him to question his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it makes any sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people putting sticks in my wheels and questioning my every move," he explained his doubts.
"At the same time, a lot of people told me I shouldn't give up, or others will come."
"It's trust I can't give up," he said.
In fact, he says that his motivation is to go on with the work he started with Gazzek.
"More work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to cross it all."
"There have been processes that can produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation in the Association might return to the one before Gaszek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and this is something in which Mirek Pelta is hardly competent."
"It's surrounded by people who would do football so that it can be made available only to the chosen."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but I'm definitely not a subject."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the chosen minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he denies the charges that he will be only the President of the Czech Republic.
"Although a lot of people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about splitting the second league into the Czech and Moravian sides, the victors of which would continue to fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation where the league has only three Moravia teams, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Reich.
While Plzen's club manager Tomás Paclik has entered the presidential struggle, Reichle has not dared to appreciate his chances of winning.
“At the same time, I still have strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its vice-president, and I see that I have made some obvious progress,” he said, “and to his success, it is the saving of tens of millions of kroner on unprofitable contracts, the negotiation of contracts with TV, and the negotiation of a lottery law.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
In his claim that Pelta was "excluded from the process of retrieving Czech football, "he considers another rival, Paclik, to be a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt he's been doing a great job in Plzen this year."
"If he is selected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gaschek has begun, without major changes in the staff of the committees."
"He wouldn't distort the facts for his own benefit," said Reichle about his rival.
Europe’s Most Beautiful Pools
Jump in the water
Julia Stanek
Universal fiber-optic and status-basins in Budapest. Travelers can try on the incredible water of Europe and relax the tired body in a hot tub after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder couldn't do on his research trips for the last year and a half: without his bathing suit.
On her back in the water, she stared up at the taste of the well-formed dome, swam to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the end of the pool, and glanced at the carefully rebuilt al-nuo swimming pools.
She was in a hurry to add each enjoyable pool to her own notebook - with important details about the building and the history of the building.
Architecture historian Meder examined more than 200 swimming pools -- and now she's got an impression in her recently published book Badefrieden, where everything went, from the public pools in Munich to the historic docks in the Black Forest and the "functional concrete buildings" in Taunus.
Its “travel to the most unusual baths in Central Europe” has been held in 13 countries, in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it has visited bathing in Italy, the Czech Republic, France, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a true enthusiast of bathing culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but in the water it's different.
The only shortcoming is that swim fans have to put up with the blue cassette and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe the lucrative smell of coniferous woods, or listen to the joyous whirling of birds in the park.
"I once asked myself why swimming pools should always be so terrible," said a woman in Vienna Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Pooling and exquisite oil in the sauna is a health factor in the baths, because Meder thinks all the feelings are stimulant.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure to the eye if the builders take on this kind of work. "Instead of the floor in the pool, you have the surface of the water."
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All visually reflected: high ceilings, colored tiles, and trams.
The 190-page Illustration of The Joy of Bathing contains valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of oasis of health - and makes you want to jump in the water.
Meder, a water collector, found a number of outstanding copies during a study in Hungary.
She found plenty of nitrita water in the Carst Cave (The Cave in Michaltz-Tapolt) and a thermal bath full of alkaline water in a bottled building (Városi Terminálfordö in Jasberen), as well as excellent therapeutic baths, such as the 100-year-old Secheni baths in Budapest.
Of the many heated open pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, you can see the whole Zurich from the bathing room on the roof, or you can see the snowy Arlberg from the open pool in St. Anton, and there's a window in the steam room to see what's happening on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design is in Langenfeld, and the Aqua Cathedral in Ectal looks like an UFO just landed in the Alps.
In the winter, a pair of three open sinks rise from it, which seem very small in the context of the Ectal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Meder's pool collector didn't see the smell of chlorine in every pool.
A lot of thermal baths smell like grey, and the Arpade ducts in Bekeshchab smell so much like oil, you might find it hard to believe you're in a health source.
The scent is caused by hydrocarbonates in alkaline water, and the water is almost black from the eel, which sticks to the skin as you sink into the pool, a healthy experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was at a certain point disillusioned with her search for beautiful bathing places, and when she tried to visit the open basin of the Czech Dome in Lugochovitz, she found that the area was sealed.
The tubs, designed by the architect Dushan Jurkowitz in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked in the view of the window of the red-and-white-yellow Ar-nuo style, she saw weeds growing between the cafeteria tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was halted was a hot spot, an amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald, the Palace of Thermal Waters in Bad Bildbad.
The pools have already been built in three stages, and you will find not only the neo-Romanian elements of the period after the construction in 1844, but also the Moorite Alhambra Hall, which was added in about 1900.
After a thorough renovation in 1995, the Thermal Palace, the favorite swimming pool of the Iris Meder pools, and not just because it is from Schwarzwald.
"This is a real achievement -- so skillful to combine such different architectural styles," says Meder.
Dumping in a thermal pool in a palace like this is clearly a secondary occupation.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank is investigating trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tives
Will Deutsche Bank Stop Trade in Agricultural Products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the effects of speculation on the world's poor.
The Executive Director is planning to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
For Germans, the situation is clear: According to one study, 84 per cent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of the interviewees demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the world ' s poorest people.
The findings were drawn from a study by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa on behalf of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report from Foudwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Garald Schumann, has shown that the game of world commodity exchange rates raises the price – and the banks are thus involved in global hunger.
The campaign is directed directly against the head of Deutsche Bank, Joseph Akkermann, even though major banking houses, such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, are also traded in the same way.
Originally, commodity rates were intended as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any event, most experts now agree that the players have given up the rules of supply and demand - and profited from the poorest.
In contrast to the United States competitors, Akkermann responded to the criticism, and he promised to investigate the charges, and said that no trade “is worth putting the good image of Deutsche Bank at risk”.
In line with SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foudwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods can fall or stop at all.
Ackermann is working on his image.
President Foudwatch Tilo Bode was pleased with the news, stressing his critical view of the financial sector. “The bids on rising food prices are an egregious example of how banks are now unthinkable against common interests.”
As the bank's main lobbyist, Ackermann has a certain responsibility, according to Bode.
"Deutsche the Bank has to delete all the investments that make money on food prices from the portfolio," said Bode.
"It doesn't matter if it's about hungry people or the image of Deutsche Bank."
A quick response by Ackermann at first is surprising, but in the meantime, the director would like to have an impeccable image just a few months before the end of his stay in the office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not go to the watchdog board as planned.
Abolishing the debatable speculation on the food market could improve the image of food.
It also has little to do with the cost - the consequences will have to be borne by its successor.
One out of two would not invest in the goods.
Foudwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
Bode published a study on Tuesday, and the study was carried out for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on November 7 and 8, and 1001 people participated.
Not more than 11 per cent believe that the investment that is on the food price is acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many bankers would also take concrete steps if they found out that their bank was involved in such trade, and the study found that one in two would withdraw the deposits that eventually led to the speculation of the goods.
Forty-three per cent would have recommended leaving the bank, and 49 per cent said that they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st-century House in Vienna
A Pavilion in a New Place
Ingeborg Winsowski
The Architectural History of Ups, Falls, and Happiness: The Austrian Pavilion for the 1958 World Exposition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was emptied, and was abandoned.
Now it's re-opened as an exhibition center.
The Austrian pavilion, designed by Carl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exposition in Brussels, is a well-known example of a modern post-war architecture with simple forms, glass halls, which have been bold in their belief in technological progress.
The Schwanzer Pavilion won the Grand Prix in Architecture in 1958 for its light swelling structure of steel and glass.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built an Austria pavilion at the next World Expo.
After all, he was famous for the world in 1973 for his legendary four-cylinder tower BMW and her sister, a cup-shaped building.
The pavilion, conceived as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near the Southern Station of Vienna, transformed and opened as a Museum of the 20th century in 1962 - and is often referred to as the 20th-century House for this reason.
In any event, the building was not suitable for the Museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls to hang the artworks, and bad air-conditioning.
But it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna got a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and his condition has been getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has so far renovated a pavilion called the 21st-century House and will be used as a Museum of Modern Art.
This museum is a branch of the Bellvedere Museum, which will open the first exhibit on Tuesday evening, in all ways a joyous event.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who was the new director of the Austrian Bellveder Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate of the Department of Art History with a brilliant career as a young figure, who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, persuaded politicians and keepers to continue with the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations, and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum was to include a permanent exhibition of the Fritz Wotruba Foundation, a coffee shop and a book store, along with modern art, and an office building was to be built.
Strict Control of & Limited Budget
Krishanitz was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secsion, Joseph Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also studied from Schwanzer at the University of Vienna of Technology, and the pavilion was a "exclusively important place" for him to attend the "almost weekly" exhibitions.
He knew the original design, and he knew the challenges that the building was facing, a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and ease when it was moved to Vienna and converted.
The problem with the last reconfiguration was much more serious, and the building was an energy absorber, says Krishanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade have been replaced, the glass-enhanced safety window has been inserted, and the glass roof has been replaced by a high-powered safety window.
The steel junctions of the thermal bridge have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos has been removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors have created space for new use of the building, and the fall of a light well between the building and the street provides light -- a very new building, but still a delightful Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors were kept, and the building was painted in the old red-brown color of protection against corrosion.
The hall is the same as it used to be.
All of this is subject to strict control of the museum administration and with a limited budget.
"We've often had to find material that was good, cheap, and would have been approved by the Museum Office," says Krishanitz, pointing to an unbalanced floor in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy, despite the constraints, the problems and the transformation.
Krishanitz recently noticed that the Brussels pavilion was rude - a typical story of a "copie in the city."
Such an architecture “always out of place” and still wants to “stimulate real awareness”.
The 21st-century house is in the right place, because the city's planning has had an unexpected turnaround.
The 21st-century house can be supplemented by the second building of Krishanitz, a collector of Francesca von Habsburg, who has acquired the Berlin Hall of Exposition and is reportedly negotiating with the city to be next to it in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multi-million-dollar winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of trains in the winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of Euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million Euros this year to avoid the winter cancellations and late trains.
Referring to Deutsche Bahn's internal crisis plan, the newspaper Bill states that a total of about 300 million Euros are planned for investment by 2015.
The investment is designed to make locomotives and the rail network more work even under extreme weather conditions.
The number of in-house and engaged staff involved in the clean-up of snow from tracks and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The aim is to clear the platforms from snow and ice before work and 90 per cent of the required arrows within four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancelling and late trains this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced a major difficulty in passenger transport, as she was short of reserves at a time when the weather was deteriorating.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays in ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn has also had to check the axis of ICE trains much more frequently for many years after one of the ICE trains broke down the axis at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay a lot of millions of pounds of fine in the United States.
New troubles have followed the upheavals of Joseph Ackermann, Director General of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank faces a fine of £1 million in the United States.
As if Deutsche Bank had little trouble in his home country, the past industrial giant in the United States has now caught it up, and Deutsche Bank, with its headquarters in Frankfurt, will pay $145 million (106 million Euro) to calm the disputes that have arisen after the bankruptcy of the five major credit unions.
The problem was the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of the bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and pulled down credit unions.
"We're glad to have solved this problem without the parties going to court," said Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank did not plead guilty in the agreement.
The same is true for Citigroup, who has agreed to pay $20.5 million.
The president of NCUA, Debbie Mattz, welcomed the prompt response of both banks.
The National Credit Unions Authority (NCUA), is responsible for US credit unions, and intervenes in bankruptcy to protect consumer deposits.
The NCUA is fighting to compensate for the losses from billions.
This is the first such agreement.
The manager also drew attention to other major banks and in the summer brought a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Goldman Sachs.
Dubious mortgage bonds are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
They're backed up by domestic loans.
This decided on the fate of a number of financial companies when a bubble in the US real estate market exploded in 2007.
The American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life on the brink of a financial crisis in September 2008.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have made a large number of claims, claiming compensation or punishing fraudsters.
The Federal Agency for Housing Finance (FHFA) is behind the largest wave of claims.
It's blaming the 18 major international banks for having bought some $200 billion in bond from American credit organizations Fannie Mae and Fredegie Mac.
Deutsche Bank is also at risk of being prosecuted by FHFA for the many agreements with a total value of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires a bank with a head office in Frankfurt to take responsibility for “substantial losses”, but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche The Bank rejected the claims as baseless and indicated its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffet invests 10 billion in IBM
Buffet's financial guru is an active investor in IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares totalling more than $10 billion.
So far, the largest American investor, Warren Buffet, has always stated that he does not invest in computer and IT companies, as their long-term development is hard to predict.
But IBM's annual report has changed his view of investing in the industry.
According to Buffet, he should have known much earlier that IBM was the first to offer services and to buy computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffet's investment was viewed as a knight's act.
IBM, an IT-industry veteran, has now won the title "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the United States Business Channel, CNBC Buffet reported that since March, he has purchased an IBM stock of $10.7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway was one of the largest IBM stockholders with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffet said even IBM didn't know anything about his involvement until recently.
He lauded the management, who was able to make a profit even during the financial crisis.
"They've done a lot of work," said Buffet, with a management strategy.
For a long time, IBM has focused on high-income IT services such as data centres.
The founder of the computer industry, now over 100 years old, also offers software and consultancy services, as well as powerful business computers.
So far, Buffet has been avoiding tech companies.
He claimed to invest only in those companies whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, the production of lubricant and engineering.
His holding of Berkshire Hathaway has shares in a long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (former Münchener Rueck), along with some 80 of his own subsidiaries.
An 81-year-old bought a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, and built it as one of the world's most expensive companies.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
Makes it a form of worship for countless investors all over the world.
His almost unmistakable instinct to make money brought him the nickname "Orakula of Omaha."
The price of IBM shares rose by one per cent before the opening of markets after Buffet's investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, as IBM is also called, is on the stock exchange for more than $220 billion, making it one of the world's most expensive high-tech companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffet, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend of his.
The imminent danger
After the identification of the Tswickau cell, the Turkish media began to question the authority of the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers is talking about a blood ideology, which is on the surface again.
The murders of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have been a response to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has led to long-forgotten fears, such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks have not occurred since the fires in Mellin in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There was no doubt, however, that xenophobia existed in Germany.
But the right-wing extremist network that has now been discovered is of a magnitude that is not yet fully understood.
"Resurrecture of Bloody Ideology?" was the headline of the Internet version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informer of the secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities may be drawn into the right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted quietly, remembering the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket in front of the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish Community of Berlin, at a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians, celebrated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral employment agreement.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a history of success.
Coverage in some Turkish media was like a slapping. "German's 50th anniversary gift" is the title of an article on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of a series of murders.
The German edition of Hürriet, too, did not miss the opportunity to draw this parallel.
"Smells bad" is the name of the column of Ahmet Kulahji.
He notes that people have been killed who have been paying taxes and have made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany by their work.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent successful raid have been severely criticized on the German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors queried why the German authorities had not thought earlier of following up suspicious persons in right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors have come to a rather steep rhetoric. "If they continue to act as clumsy as ever, migrants will have no choice but to have armed self-defense."
"It'll be the best self-defense."
"The world in Germany is very much dependent on how the whole network is opened up and on the legality of the punishment," writes Selen.
The crimes in Mellin and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat to the world in Germany.
The picture of the burning ruins in Zolingen was deeply captured in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
No other event has shown so clearly to the Turks here that they are in danger, and to the Germans that distrust and apathy can result in real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity of the Turks.
Do not repeat past error
The Turkish press at the time condemned mainly the failure of the German police following the attacks, and Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mellin.
He sent a telegram of sympathies to the President of Turkey after the arson in Zolingen, but his Minister for Foreign Affairs, Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel, took part in a memorial ceremony in Cologne in his speech to compute the taxes the Turks paid in Germany,
It's like he defined the value of a man by the taxes he pays.
The current media coverage in the Turkish media has again shown how the distrust of many German Turks with the current German state has deepened ever since.
By making clear what needs to be done now, in addition to the effort to identify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking scandal on Lake Zurich
Most of Europe’s top risky banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been fighting one or the other ever since.
Now he has to be put back on the right course by the German.
Alex Webber certainly didn't know he was gonna get this part.
In July, after his effective retirement as head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would take up an equally effective position, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank, UBS, and an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Alex Weber was clearly enthralled, lauded Switzerland for its beauty, the UBS for its newfound strength, and made a few friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has been able to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Caspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel."
But it became clear in September that things would be very different.
The UBS trader in London has outrun the bank's security system and has lost about 1.7 billion Euros.
Osvald Grubel, a banker, not only in Switzerland, had to leave UBS Executive Director.
Since then, the chairman of the UBS Board of Directors has been considered sick, and everyone wants to know, when will Alex Webber finally take up his job?
Webber has been required to consult the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he'll be chairing the board in May, not in 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Webber.
He's an economics professor and a Central Bank expert, not a traditional banker, and he's definitely gonna need time to adapt.
He suddenly found himself responsible for the bank's strategy, which once again proved that he had long earned the rank of the “largest bank scandal in Europe”.
UBS, on the one hand, is very big - until recently, it has run the world's largest assets - and, on the other hand, it has not been out of scandals for years.
The proud Swiss bank does not seem to spare anything.
It all began during the financial crisis.
Up to 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The bank combined the image of a hidden and stable but sloppy asset manager with an ambitious goal and a desire to become the largest player in an investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, so that it has more money in the management of a wealthy client than any other bank in the world,
And as an investment bank, he joined the league of the world's major banks.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and a longtime professor at the University of Zurich Institute of Banking, explains: "I've always given my students UBS as a model of a good bank."
"Knowing what we know now, you can ask me how I could be so wrong."
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was going wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, Executive Director Peter Wuffley, who was considered an outstanding intellectual and, to the same extent, a brilliant banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The bank's investment unit tried to play on sub-standard securities and was forced to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS has announced an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to deal with the crisis.
The bank has indeed been able to find investors – but investors whose services many bankers would have recently politely refused – one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund so hidden that even the name of the fund has not been announced.
It was just the first punch.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The Bank had to announce new billions of losses, and Marcel Ospelle, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the second-largest Chairman of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, a disaster broke out, and because of a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS was at risk of collapse, and the state had to save it.
The National Bank purchased toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid SwF 6 billion for a convertible bond with a binding conversion to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was in shock: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of the massive banks in a small country.
After all, the total balance of UBS in 2007 was five times as high as the total output of Switzerland (see graph).
"We can't save UBS a second time," says the bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS surrendered in a tax dispute with the United States and declared that he was ready to pass on the data to the wealthy clients who might have been taxed by the bank.
UBS has also agreed to pay $780 million, which is to reimburse unsubstantiated business income plus fines.
UBS has thus more or less recognized it as a tax evasion tool.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been his advantage in the fight for rich clients, a cloak of secrecy.
After this scandal, Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The customer's money has begun to run out.
In a few months, the bank has lost confidence in both major areas of its business - investment due to misperforming speculations and asset management as a result of aid and the promotion of tax evasion.
And it just calmed down, and it seemed like UBS had been able to reverse the situation, as was the case with the treacher, and one single trader dropped 1.7 billion Euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
One thing is clear: risk management in the investment office is not yet working.
“The Adoboli incident has made it clear that risk control has not changed enough,” says Martin Jansen, Professor of Economics and Finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking, University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also has no doubt: "The problem with UBS is that he has no risk control tool."
It was caution that has long made Swiss bankers the custodians of the world ' s major assets - not an unnecessary risk, but security for money, whether or not the world has fallen apart outside the Alpine Republic.
The Safes of Swiss Banks have become a symbol of irresistible reliability, as Lindt and Sprangli symbolize the refined taste in chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the image of a worthy Swiss private bank, but it's a bit more.
Her location is a classical one.
The head office of the bank is located in Zurich, in Bangofstrasse, which is leading from the main station to the Zurich Lake, surrounded by snow caps of the Swiss Mountains.
Buildings are luxurious, and shop leases are one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss shops like Confiserie Springli, you can find such jewellery companies as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been stationed here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Creedy Suisse Palace and elite private banks, such as Julius Beer.
A heavy door leads to the UBS Lobby.
There are big leather sofas along the marble-covered walls next to the bank's big sign "Safe."
UBS knows what his clients need, trustworthiness.
But the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned the Swiss notions of banking - or, according to the head of one of the small Swiss banks, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the paper - like all the Swiss bankers, he's also working with the two big banks.
He believes that UBS has become too big - in particular in an investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are very active.
In his view, the Swiss have nothing to add.
"And if there's something, then they've long adapted to Anglo-Saxon custom."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, made it the first big profit – and then fiasco – that no other European financial institution has lost so much money in the jungle of sub-standard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became clear on 15 October 2008.
"In that environment, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people has carried out the largest rescue operation in the country's history," writes Lucas Hassig in his book The UBS Crack.
Politicians have approved the allocation of SwF 68 billion (about €45 billion) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have come to this?
If you ask the Swiss banks, they'll say the problem is mostly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks joined in a major group in June 1998.
A bank was created, which at the time of the merger was too big for a small Switzerland, and a bank that continued to grow.
The two banks that created UBS also helped to complement each other, one being a rich but high-level bank specializing in the management of assets in Zurich; the other was not so rich, but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a lot of money that they could use to spin an all-powerful wheel.
Two names are related to the growth of UBS: Peter Wolfley, Executive Director of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Osple, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolfley and Ospelle was a dream team," said Hans Geiger, a bank analyst.
"Wolfley, an outstanding intellectual, a modest and deeply understanding model and statistic, and Ospelle with his inner instinct, all the way up, starting with an intern at the bank."
But Ospel finally put his trust in Wolfley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake. "He thought his models were real," Geiger said.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
Members of UBS remember very well the meetings of the board, at which Wolfley always repeated the same motto - to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he was the head of the "Tourning Table" where the bank's progress was made.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make a part of the way.
UBS was the largest player in the trade in currency and public securities.
Authorized management advisors, however, pointed to a weak spot, and in terms of what is termed “continuous income”, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS has failed in American mortgage products.
In order to shut the hole, the UBS engaged in an adventure that almost cost his life.
With a view to growth, the bank and its hedge fund invested in US sub-standard securities.
This has evolved into a large mechanism that combined securities based on American mortgages and sold them further - continuing to bear the risk.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS bought up to the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire," says Geiger, a bank analyst.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to clean up the bank were more difficult than it was at first.
The posts in UBS have become a children's game with chairs and are still unreliable until today.
Anyone who runs this big bank is facing an almost impossible task.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Bank Analyst Geiger already has the idea of quitting investment banking, focusing on asset management, and forgetting his Swiss origins.
The bank, however, is not yet ready to go this far.
It is clear, however, that investment must be significantly stifled.
The new head of the Bank, Sergio Ermotti, is planning to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
A 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was in fact viewed only as a temporary solution when the bank abruptly broke up with his predecessor, Grubel.
In the past, he has been able to show character, and, as the Zurich Bank stated on Tuesday, he now leads UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the state it was in the mid-90s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions must be Axel Weber's.
Publicly, he still said he and his wife were looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of a recession in Europe push down the US stock exchange
The coming recession in Europe has made American investors more moody at the start of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome has not had much effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has overwhelmed the hope that the debt crisis can be overcome in the bud.
The general relief that followed the changes of governments in Rome and Athens was not backed up.
The euro fell relative to the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek cups were still considered half-full, not half-empty - but now the problems are back to the top, said Mark Luskini of Janey Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on the sales list.
The Dow Jones index closed at 12.078 with a drop of 0.6 per cent.
The market barometer in the course of the trade ranged between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The wider S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, falling by one percent.
The Nasdaq tech index lost 0.8 per cent, trading on 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell by 1.2 per cent, shutting down at 5,985 points.
Industry in the 17 euro-zone countries has significantly reduced production and is adapting to the end of growth.
The statistical office of Eurostat reported that in September, companies produced two per cent less than in the previous month.
"We're not on an island, we're dependent on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe was unlikely to shake the recession fast, and that banks were showing further signs of weakness.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, was only able to confirm those concerns, and in an interview with CNBC, he said that it was still not clear whether Europe was strong enough to do whatever was needed to end the crisis.
So, in his view, it was too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffet threw a ten-year-old principle in the trash and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His IBM investment of more than $10 billion raised the value of this oldest company’s stock in the course of the trade by almost one percent against the trend.
The stock closed down, with little change, at $187.35.
Buffet claimed to have paid an average of $170 for the stock and now has a share of 5.5 per cent.
The value of his stock company, Berkshire Hathway, fell by 1.3 per cent.
Bank of America stock fell by 2.6 per cent, much worse than the market.
The bank has converted into cash almost all of its remaining share of the Chinese Building Bank, with $6.6 billion.
The Bank's main plan is to support its capital quota with a net profit from the sale in order to meet stricter standards.
Boeing's aeroplane maker won by reducing the losses on Dow-Jones.
The stock price rose by 1.5 per cent after the company received the highest order in its history.
On Sunday, Emirates ordered 50 long-range jets in a series of 777 with a total value of $18 billion.
Including the option to buy another 20 planes, the total is actually 26 billion dollars.
Some 710 million shares have been replaced by the New York Stock Exchange.
The stock of 719 companies rose, 2,281 fell, and 79 remained at the same level.
The stock of 630 companies completed their bids, 1913 fell, and 82 remained at the same level at Nasdaq with a turnover of 1.38 billion shares.
Intelligent crows fill the cities
Now, we're talking about these very smart birds in a lot of places, and the experts say that these very smart birds can't be out of the city.
Some people like birds, others want to get rid of them as fast as possible, and the crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but the people who complain about dirt and noise are getting bigger in many localities.
A solution to the problem of birds, however, is far from being achieved.
At the first symposium on crows in the city of Lear in East Frisian, experts argued that it was no longer possible to banish graches from cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Looking for urban alternatives
Conservatives argued that the root of the problem in urban areas was the migration of specially protected graches, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying the traditional habitats.
The hunt, the growing construction, and the cutting off of traditional nesting trees have made life more difficult for the birds.
The crows are under protection.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the north-west in Yever, Dipholz, Achim under Bremen, and Lera, there are large colonies with more than 600 parent couples.
A mixed project to kill crows in Lera led to disapproving headlines in 2005.
Critics described the catching of birds in traps and slaughtering them with sticks as particularly brutal.
"The usual move and frighten don't do anything." said the architect and landscape designer Werner Klever of Lera.
Nest-breaking water strings or felling trees often have undesirable consequences, said an environmental expert, Manfred Kaiser, from Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"Livables dissipate, and the big colonies split up and spread to other areas."
Intimidation is possible only on an exceptional basis in the vicinity of hospitals, old-age homes and schools.
"We're gonna have to live with them.
In isolation from the surroundings, the urban problem will not be solved, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kellner.
Combining the frightening of birds from needy residential areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be a way out.
"Intelligence stands instead of chainsaws" was a slogan put forward by a psychologist and ethnologist, Oughta Maria Jürgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We need to be sure of ourselves to live with this problem."
Jurgens was one of the founders of an educational crowline in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information stands provide information on the life of very smart graches.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jurgens also gave her opinion on complaints about the noise made by birds. "The sound of the noise is a lot of information, and they have a lot to say to each other."
The brains and the wits of these birds have become legends.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge have recently tested the magnitude of the avian mind on four grams.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that they needed to knock on the table to get the mold larvae.
Without much training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to hit the tablet.
In another experiment, smart graches had to solve a more complex task.
The researchers put a small bucket with a mold larvae in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get a prey with a beak.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used wire to get hooks and hooks to grab a bucket by a pen and get it out of the cylinder.
Three out of four grams have done it since the first try.
Ronaldo is taking Portugal to Euro2012.
The hope of the Bosniacs and the Turks to win at the last minute was long overdue.
The Favorits of Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Cup.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won their last seats in the Euro2012 Championships in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored for eight and 53 minutes, Portugal won Bosnia and Herzegovina with a score of 6:2 (2:1), ideally formatting its fifth entry to the euro after 0:0 in the first stage.
The Czechs had enough to be 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of playoffs against Montenegro's outsider after a pure win in the first round (2:0).

A former Wolfsburg player from the English championship Manchester City for 33 minutes sent the ball head to the lower end of the bar, but the ball didn't cross the line of the gate.
Jirachek scores for the Czech Republic.
The focus was then on Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
After an attack on Elder Postig in the Bosnian fine station at 36 minutes, Stark decided that the Portuguese player was faking, and he showed him a yellow card.
Stark also handed down a dubious penalty for playing the game with his hand after the foul of Fabio Quantran-Missimovic made it work.
After the break of the European Vice-Champions in 2004, four more scores were added.
Peter Jirachek dispelled all the remaining doubts about the Czechs for the 81st minute.
The 1976 European Championships are the fifth in a row.

The porter Peter Chech for the 9th minute, thanks to an instant reflex, prevented the potential tomasha Siwok's autogole.
Montenegro's best chance was when a duet was on the field by Stevan Jovetitch and Dejan Damianovic.
Damianovic hit off the edge of the bar at the 40th minute and almost hit a goal for the Czech.
After a break in the pants, she rescued the already shattered Czech world-class Hollywood after the forward of FC Seoul left the field for a 50-minute time.
The win-win goal was hit just before the final whistle.
In the meantime, Turkey was short of football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks failed to play better than the 0:0 in Zagreb.
Although there is now little doubt that Gus Hiddink, the coach of the team, will now have a seat on the bench of the team that peaked at number three in 2002, the Croats find themselves for the fourth time in the European Final Tour.
The Turks were almost able to make a perfect start in front of the 31,000 viewers at the Maximir Stadium.
Celjuk Inan's long-distance hit the bar for seven minutes, and the attacker, Kazim Kazim, failed to hit the ball in the net.
After that, Croatia wakes up and has increasingly taken control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent form.
The Legionaries of the Bundesliga, Daniel Pranich (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Ainthrat, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manjukic of the Wolfsburg team, who took over Ivan Perishic of Dortmund for the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni is on his way to Euro2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro entry after Germany in 1988.
The team of Coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who already looked secure in her place after the 4-0 win in the first stage, took the lead for the 32nd minute thanks to Stephen Ward's goal.
Konstantin Vassilev of the guest team had a 57-minute bill.
Ireland has been at a good pace from the start, but at the 23rd minute, Robbie Keene from Los Angeles made the first clean bare punch.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed to stop him from leading Ireland forward.
The goal was set for 32 minutes.
Bypassing the protection of Holiday Paul Londonk, Ward found himself in the right place, and by putting the ball across the line, he changed the score by 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
The largest software producer in Europe, SAP, is planning to invest billions and almost double the number of its employees in China in the next few years.
The company on the Dax list announced on Thursday that it was going to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion Euro) by 2015.
"We will create more opportunities for research and development and employ thousands of people," he said in his statement, Bill McDermott, one of SAP's executives, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
A state of 2,500 is expected to grow to 4500.
The world market leader for industrial software plans to double the number of his offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chendu and Daljan.
This country, which is experiencing an economic boom, has about 4,000 SAP clients out of more than 176,000 worldwide.
China's growth rate is an important component of this company's Dax listing strategy for 2015.
SAP plans to increase its turnover to Euro20 billion by 2015.
Last year, a company from Waldorf earned about 12.5 billion Euros.
The business of a software vendor with 55,000 people around the world looks better than ever.
SAP has been in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to change the scope of our operations," McDermott said.
"Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth based on information in China."
Massacres - the human dimension
Peter Englund's strenuous and very good new book, "Beauty and Pray: The Personal History of World War I," is starting with a long list of actors who cause the heart to die.
Here's how to read it next: take this page carefully and use it as a bookmark.
You'll get to know these people very well as Mr. Englund's story goes, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon at a time when, like one of these men and women, you'll get off the road and get lost in the mist of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which is awarding the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book he's written now is unusual, he describes it, quite precisely, as "work on anti-history."
There are few known names, important treaties, or famous battles; there are few ambassadors, clever journalists, or discussions on tactics and combat technology.
It's not so much a book about what was, - he explains - it's a book about what it was like, it's about "the feelings, the impressions, the feelings and the state of the spirit."
The book "Beauty and Pilgrimage" combined the experience of 20 more or less uncharted men and women, on both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone's gonna go into captivity, lose a hand or a leg, go crazy or die.
Their lives are blinking here like church candles: new ones are added to a lot of others, and some are fading at this time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of history.
This is also an amendment to the idea that the First World War was just a gravel war on the West Front.
"Beauty and Pilgrimage" is a skillful panorama of other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkan, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are hit by bee hives; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unsolved problem is the tsetse flies.
It's an exciting book, almost from the start.
War has engendered the lives of these people as a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling of smokeless gunpowder.
When you're not far from being heard, and you're a woman at home with the kids, will you stay or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on or why we have to fight in this war.
"The lack of facts," observes Mr. Englund, "is replete with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessions, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumours."
"Beauty and Pilgrimage" traces the fate of people like Florence Farmoro, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young mariner of the German High Seas Fleet.
Their stories are drawn mainly from memoirs, letters and other material already published.
Their stories may be frightening or exciting, but they are highly alive thanks to Mr. Englund ' s small moments and fragmentary details.
Many of them talk about deprivation and how to deal with it.
Telling the history of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzaz, there's an erzac everywhere."
"Replacer, forged aluminum, false rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He's still talking about the eszac food in Germany.
It describes “the meat of pressed rice welded in ovine fat (and decorated with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried root and dried potato skin; footwear shattered by a tree”.
He notes that there were “837 registered meat substitutes for sausage, 511 registered coffee substitutes”.
Some stories talk about honour and courage.
One American observes the most violent in his mind and says, "You feel that, in the end, this is what men have been created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, an evening paper or a bestseller, and to say that this display is a civilisation, and under your colorful dressing shirt, there's no barbaric."
The British soldier, on the contrary, observes that he is likely to die and no one will notice or be saddened.
"When a man accepts the idea of self-sacrifice, he'd like to think it's gonna happen in front of the public," he writes.
But it's the other way around, it's like a "convicted man who's been hung up in secret."
Other comments refer to old Europe, which is falling apart, and to new types of fear.
"The conflict has become an increasingly economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "the war factories."
He points out the arrival of someone who is called "a new kind of besty in the beginning of the century: a well-expressed and ideologically-convinced mass murderer in a well-mixed suit that organizes a carnage sitting behind a writing table."
People are acting in an unforeseeable way: the same thing as heroism.
Mr. Englund spoke about the soldiers who tried to get sexually transmitted diseases from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front.
"The greatest expression of this is seen in the trade in gonorrhoea, which the soldiers bought and smeared in their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital," he writes.
"Every desperate swirl it in the eye, which often led to life's blindness."
Translated with the Swedish Peter Graves Proza by Mr. Englund, a flexible but non-brostic, ideal for his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, it shows how the war “have freed completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People are starting to ask why their leaders make them fight.
The best books on World War I were often indirect, such as Paul Fassel's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as "On the West Front without Change" by Erich-Marie Remarka, rather than full history.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this uncalibrated pantheon.
His book has the most amazing finale I can remember in unfaithful literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he reached out to a page with a list of characters, got it out of your hand, and set it on fire with a match.
After the previous error, a well-conceived raid
Hundreds of police officers, some wearing protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
The night watch from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zucotti Park was supposed to be the least of the people at this time.
The operation was kept a secret from all but a few high-level officers, and the others were first told that they were on their way to the exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the events, and his presence highlighted the importance the Department of Police attached to the operation.
There could be no repetition in the past weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which was in contravention of the Department's rules and caused a massive public sympathy for the occupiers.
So after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation was launched to release the Zukotti Park protesters.
The authorities were preparing to see the occupations unfold in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises have been carried out on Randells Island with a view to Zucotty.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot training - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid transfer of a large number of police officers - in the context of Lower Manhattan.
The last exercise was held on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at the "last minute," a source who was familiar with the orders, in which the task was referred to as "training."
"The few cops I know who have been called to do this, they didn't say they're being sent to Zucotti Park," said this man, who spoke on anonymous terms.
"The only people who knew they were going to Zucotti Park were at the highest levels in the department."
One of the reasons for secrecy was the lesson the city learned.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clean up the park, but retreated to hundreds of protesters who swung in before the deadline, hearing about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday was attended by members of the various police units, including the district forces, the police teams, who were used to control the criminal surroundings.
Mr. Kelly said that a lot of people, almost like work, come and go out of the park during the day, making 1:00 a.m. an appropriate time for an attack.
"It was right to do it when the park is the least of the people," he said.
The rescue vehicles with spotlights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The spotlights and pre-recorded ads from the loudspeakers seem to have terrorized many protesters.
When administrative officers entered the park in their blue windshields, many protesters just packed their things and left.
The police said the tents didn't touch until 1:45 a.m., giving the protesters time to pack up.
Other groups of police, according to eyewitnesses, met around the perimeter to get inside in the event that the park required arrests.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the head of the Police Department, said it was for their safety.
But many reporters claim that they were not allowed to see the police and that the police treated them rudely.
Mr. Brown said that a car with a camera on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could take a picture.
When the police went west through a bunch of protesters' personal belongings, including bags, plastic mats, and polyethylene bags, full of clothes, the Department of Public Health was following her, gathering what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were pulled out, and the photographs soon appeared on the Internet.
A major group of protesters took up positions next to the camp's kitchen, at the center of the park.
Some of them built barricades, and the police went inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp shackled themselves together in arms.
And two men chained themselves to the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
To cut off the locks, rescue officers were called.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The clean-up operation was completed about 75 minutes later, and the police reported.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 people had been arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for “infringing public order and resisting detention”, he said.
The highest officer in the field was Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and senior officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, the head of the D.A.P.D., was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, though present, "not led the operation," said Mr. Brown.
A second group of policemen was waiting on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they needed to get inside.
The fences were placed in Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block south.
Observers saw the police expand the perimeter from these positions even beyond the Zukotti Park border.
At one point, the observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, push people farther away.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
About 5:00 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped on the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, aired the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one policeman and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The school service union will sue the city for dismissal.
The trade union, representing the hundreds of school staff who lost their seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that the dismissals were not necessary and were discriminatory due to the disproportionate impact on the schools where the poor learn.
The trial is probably the last option available to the Trade Union of the District Council 37, which is trying to cancel the dismissal.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, the focal point for work with parents and other employees, who were among the lowest-paying workers in the city, lost their jobs on 7 October, as a result of the fact that trade union leaders called a political response to their refusal to give the city access to health funds run by labour groups to fill the gap in the budget last spring.
City officials categorically rejected the charge.
At the City Council hearing last month, the chancellor of the Dennis M. Wolcott Schools said that the dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the board members was paralysing, telling him that there was no indication in the budget that the school support staff would be dismissed.
Members of the 37 District Council reported that they had filed a notice of claims, warning the Department of Education that a claim was filed against it; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce a formal application to the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The claim will refer to Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the city and list eight employees who have been temporarily dismissed as appellants, all black or Latin American women, as well as most of the assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city's legal department, said that the city had not seen the suit and was therefore unable to comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the complaint in the New York Times, the trade union focused on a number of layoffs in schools in the city ' s poor to support a claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools lost more assistants because they were chronically under-funded.
He points out that while there were no layoffs in Staten Island, and there were few in High East or Tribeca High Schools, 17 school auxiliaries lost their seats in County 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Countys 8 and 9 in the Southern Bronx.
While noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked at a free high school in Harlem 36, where 68 per cent of the students live in poverty, the claim states: “This is not an area of rich parents who can find money to make up for the budget failure”.
P.S. The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way to count extra funding for every poor student who went to school.
The trade union also contends that the school principals may have been misled by the language of the notice allowing the dismissal of the parents ' focal points.
The notice used the word “excess”, although “excession” is more commonly referred to when the school's teacher on the school's payroll is moved to the list of available employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six contact points for work with parents have been dismissed," states the draft of the claim, "not just translated."
Mission over, Congress ready for an agreement on Libya.
It seems that the Republicans and the Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the insurrection in Libya.
All it took was for the mutiny to succeed, the old dictator Muammar Gaddafi was taken prisoner and killed, and the American intervention was over.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is to consider a resolution put forward by Chairman John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republikan, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), who lauds the Libyers for the successful uprising and American troops for the “greety”.
“The purpose of this resolution is to pay homage to the brave people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country,” said Kerry.
"This is a confirmation of the support of both parties for their democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but none of the discussions on Libya have been easy.
This summer, the legislators from both parties argued with each other and with the White House about the language of a series of resolutions endorsing or denouncing the role of the United States Army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution allowing for the limited use of the United States Armed Forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of the two parties and was never put to the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would cut off the financing of the American operation in Libya.
This left the American mission in some sort of legislative purge - when Congress is irritable enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not so angry as to actually get the ground out of her way.
Then the events overcame Congress's indecisiveness.
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels, and on 20 October, Gaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee “is awe of the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and perseverance in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who have been involved in the military operation to defend the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.
The resolution also “confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Would the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Council or would the legislators be split up, as was the June bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, the leader of the Republicans in the Committee, objected to the last version.
Luger's representative said on Monday that he had not yet seen the last version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives this week has to vote for a constitutional amendment that requires a balanced budget, a top legislative priority for almost every Republican and some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by a member of the House of Representatives, Bob Goodlat (republikan, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or to any other action to be put to the plenary vote of the Congress of that convocation.
Other legislators have not yet been able to make their amendments to the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
The Gudlat amendment was only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that addressed a wide range of issues that had been introduced in that meeting.
Some were duplicative - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others were minor variations.
There are at least 15 versions of the Balanced Budget amendments in the House of Representatives alone, and there is more about “control over federal expenditures”.
Some of them are also identical, but give their authors, mostly the newly elected Republicans who want to decorate their resumes, an opportunity to brag that they have “promoted” such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of the Balanced Budget Amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some Congressmen want to limit the number of terms of office of members of Congress, and a member of the House of Representatives, José Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to set aside a two-year limit for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments to guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment to prohibit same-sex marriage has been proposed for many years, as has another one to prohibit the burning of a flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two thirds of the states object to them.
As members of Congress have sought to propose amendments, they have progressed no faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments, while in the 110th Congress they made 66 such amendments.
This rate will be slower than in the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Library of the Senate, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they have been as successful as they are now.
The last amendment, the 27th, was approved in 1992 but was actually submitted to Congress in 1789.
"Beated, but not defeated," says Giffords in his first TV interview after the attack.
Ten months after an armed man shot her in the middle of a public event in Tucson, a member of the House of Representatives, Gabriel Giffords (democracy party, Arizona) appeared on the federal channel on Monday night, sang a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Back" and said she wanted to get better than to go back to Congress.
After showing up on the 20/20 program, ABC News with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to make proposals and needed help walking.
The program showed her a hard way to recover from the trauma of a bullet that crushed the skull and shattered the left side of the brain from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and triumphantly voted on the bill on the maximum debt.
In her first TV interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed, and sang - and called her recovery "hard."
When Sawyer asked how she was feeling, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the 20/20 watch special issue, which was shown on the eve of the new couple's book "Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope".
The special session spoke of the re-establishment of Giffords after the shooting on January 8.
In a video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she lies on a hospital bed with a razor head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists are teaching her how to do simple things.
Nod your head.
Put your lips out.
And then her first word, "what."
A few days later, Giffords said the second word, "toast," asking for a change in the lunch menu.
The video shown by ABC shows that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: we see the Congressman sing along with the "Girls Just Want to Fun" doctors, Cindy Loper, and "Free Fall" by Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on the procedure, she said she didn't remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said he was reading an article in the newspaper about the 12 March shooting, when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had been killed at the time.
The suspect, the assailant Jerd Lee Lafner, is being held in Missouri prison and is being subjected to forcible treatment pending trial.
"Many people are dead," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Terrible, hard, hard."
One day, during her recovery, she said to Kelly Sawyer, "I'm over."
"And I said, "Gabby, you're not defeated," said Kelly.
You're just beaten up.
And you're gonna get through this, you're gonna get better, and you're gonna get back more than ever.
Troops feel more pity than respect.
The event was an event on the Wall Street, which raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad of helplessness, frustration, and loss.
On the signal, a number of hundreds of soldiers, seafarers, pilots and marines built around it.
The audience in the tuxedo applauded him standing up.
"Soldiers were viewed as heroes," said David Salzman, who organized the spring fund-raiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, who also had the then Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They've been treated like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the planners wanted to do the right thing.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
The very contrasting impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have emerged between the army and the often apathetic, sometimes fascinated, American public.
The troops have been squandering praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, say the army.
The public is acting more and more as if it felt pity for people in uniform.
"We are not the victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who led the forces in Iraq and is about to leave for Afghanistan.
"But the only way for some to show support is to treat us like we're miserable."
It's a sensitive theme for warlords who don't want to look unthankful or dissenting to the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger experienced by the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam war was far worse.
As a result, most of the talk of pity takes place quietly and between war veterans.
After two of his sons returned from fighting in the Marines, the retired Colonel Mark Kenshn warned them that non-military men would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration, for they have overwhelmed the rebels and have been to exotic places.
Others will wonder if “under the mask of a brutal, evil veteran,” said Karen, who was in Iraq and, upon his return, took up a high government post in Washington.
While he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some interviewers were careful to ask if he would be able to withstand the stress of a responsible job in Washington, D.C., right after the combat.
Kenshn remembers saying to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to count on a negative effect."
The inconvenience experienced by the military stems in part from American indifference to war.
Victory on the battlefield is rarely lauded by a country that has little knowledge of the army and has little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value war heroism as it was in the most common way in World War II," says the retired Lieutenant General David Barnoux, who was in command of the United States forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a soldier.
The troops are rated by the number of outposts they have made, by the number of companions they have lost, or by the magnitude of the loss.
The army is facing growing pressure from anti-rape supporters
This week, a historic court hearing should decide whether 28 men and women will be sued against the army on charges of non-retrogression to rape.
If not, hundreds of appellants will be in line with the next one.
Private first-grade Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and, in the 11th week of her pregnancy, she claimed to have been raped by a coworker at night.
It was in October 2008, and she was returning to her barn at Miramar Airport, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend, and met a male coworker carrying a bag of 12 beers.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," says Lyman.
But a Texas-born girl has made up her mind.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I hadn't listened to my instinct."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, a man approached her from behind, fell and raped, she claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 current and former soldiers will look forward to a trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether or not the action they have brought against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rasmfeld, will go to court.
The claim states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to deal with the widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
The action, filed in February by counsel for Susan Burke from Washington, D.C., initially included 17 complainants, but rose to 28 in the following months, to 25 women and three men, who all claim to have been raped or threatened with sexual violence by their co-workers, and that the army failed to properly investigate, prosecute or bring justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeting the highest ranks of the army, because the problem starts with them.
"Army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can exterminate a cult of violence?
Burke also says that she has been contacted by some 400 other victims since February, many of whom may be involved in future claims.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this case - put all the eggs in one basket, so to speak - she'll open up a lot of things if she needs to keep the pressure up.
The Department of Defence Defence Defence Team, led by the Federal Prosecutor, Neil McBride, has taken steps to close the case.
The court documents that Newsweek has received reveal the defence strategy, which is essentially that former or current soldiers cannot file a claim against the army for damage to the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the Supreme Court decision of 1950, Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by persons in military service.
“Expected harm is a risk inherent in the military service of the appellants”, states the documents.
The Department of Defence has refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially barred from participating in combat, this division exists in word only: modern wars rarely have a clear line of front.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contacting local women in the war zone.
The result: between the two wars, 150 women soldiers, two thirds of them in combat, died.
It's time for the army to become modern, Burk says.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her claim, three others are being prepared.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four major military academies on the charge of promoting a feminist atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American war veterans in Viet Nam is preparing a lawsuit against an army that is centred on the diagnosis of “modification of the identity” that is put to the victims of violence to remove them from service, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of a human rights group, the Organization for the Action of Women Servants.
Her group sued the Veterans ' Office in December, accusing him of discriminating the treatment of pension applications from people who claimed to have been at risk of sexual violence during their service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures have been submitted to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, the Ministry of Traffic ' s Service for the Prevention and Control of Sexual Violence reported 3,158 attempted rapes.
But, as is well known, attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this figure is about 13.5 per cent of the 19,000 reported that year.
The report, published in March, also examined the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of the reported cases reached court, half as low as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Burke case call the attacks on them only the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported a rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell the details of the rape on 11 separate occasions to the police, doctors and commanders.
She collected evidence of the rape, and the attacker's blood, from a cut on her arm, was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat in front of a judge at a hearing in which she was asked if she had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six persons gave a positive character to the accused, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read out," says Lyman.
"I thought I was about to have a baby - I ran out of the courtroom with a yelling."
"They put me in the psych ward, and when I left, I remember my commanding officer saying, "This was not his trial, it was my trial."
Lyman was ordered to go to a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her identity change, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed in an unfavorable manner, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether Lyman's case and her suit mates are going to move forward is a complex issue, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
But he states, "I think they are in a position to move forward."
There is a doctrine between them and the verdict that has been criticized ever since it came.
I've been critical of Doctrine Feres my whole life.
The army has lagged behind for decades, because it has no incentives or restraints that impose responsibilities.
He adds, "The Chances are very much against them ... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favor, Burke, the appellant's attorney, will gather hundreds of other appellants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this matter until there is reform," she says.
Or until we die, depending on what happens earlier.
Walls have eyes: How do researchers study you on Facebook?
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremists in Europe, Anders Bering Bravik was a normal guy who spoke his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braiwick, who had confessed to the massacre in Norway in July, which had claimed 77 lives, appeared at his first public court hearing.
Although Braywick could act alone, he was far from alone on the net: he spent a lot of time prepping for an attack on his computer, in touch with the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups in social media.
After the summer tragedy, the researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy, you just have to go to Facebook.
"We've found it easy to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report on the European Cyber Populism of the British DEMOS Research Center.
The stock of personal data on Facebook is so big, says Bartlett, that it would be easy for researchers to use the site's promotional tool to identify the necessary population group with scientific certainty -- that marketers have been doing for a number of years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans all over Europe and then tipped them off with ads, but instead of showing a new band or a diet, the ads offered the user a poll that included questions about the level of their education, the attitude to violence, and the optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 members of 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries, not even leaving the office.
"This is a brand-new way to do research," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not as impressive: online right-handers are more often male youths who are dissatisfied with immigration.
But all of a sudden, "those who match their online activity with offline activity are smarter, more democratic, and less aggressive than those who are just hiding behind the screen."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers, and polytologists use the site to look into everything in the world, from health to social trends in the Laikas, wall posts, and status update.
With more than 800 million active users, adding an average of three entries a day, Facebook's "super-actual information" has created a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the name of the site in the headline by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook’s beauty is that it provides an opportunity to learn about people who cannot be reached on the street with a notebook.
"Before, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to join the party, and they'd never have accepted you," Bartlett says.
"Facebook excludes all of this - you're talking to them directly."
Others say that this site could be used to identify and investigate social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her co-workers found that students who discussed their drunken feats on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who didn't talk about it.
Moreno suggests that student peers, such as their hostel instructors, can monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often updates his drinking status.
"You can't solve the problem without finding it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behaviour and Development at the Seattle Children's Institute of Research.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk who would not otherwise have been found."
Facebook also regularly extracts various kinds of data about its users.
The site's data-processing team has been working on the status of Valentine's Day and Valentine's Status, the mid-term turnout in 2010, as well as the National Index of Happiness (mainly using information that is available to them alone), the Cyber Free Champs have long insisted that the site should make its vast data collection available to the public for research.
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for playing Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles from you, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict standards for off-line research, online data is publicly available.
"I don't think a lot of users have even thought that a researcher can watch their profile," says Neil Selwin, a sociologist at the London Science Lab, "a study he did in 2006 using the public Facebook page of a student.
"As far as they imagined, it was between them and their friends."
The question of methodology is then raised.
Even offline, there's no guarantee that the subject of the study is very fair.
On Facebook, it is not possible to find out how much information in the profile and on the user page is true.
"What you say on Facebook, and what you do outside Facebook, are two very different things," says Selvin.
That is why, despite years of work in the field of technology, Selwin thinks that the notebook and pen are still the best research tools to be used.
"Nothing can replace a way out of the real world and a way to communicate with real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social research, and most social research is still offline."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Bering Bravik will be tried for the first time in public.
Anders Bering Braywick, a man who confessed to organizing a double attack that took the lives of 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistant" fighter during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Knights of the Templers of Norway," he said to the 500 in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multi-culturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I do not confess to my guilt."
Judge Torqueel Nesheim interrupted Braywick during this monologue, because he "was not gonna give Braywick the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Bravik, who had brought a written speech with him, to address the victims ' family at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Bravik in custody for 12 more weeks, barred him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some have come in the hope of seeing Bravik in the eye, others have to make sure he's locked up.
Everyone came to find the answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," said NRK to the Norwegian channel, one of the survivors on Utoya.
"It was inconvenient, but personally, I was a little relieved after I saw and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue braywick tie, he remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked in the eyes of the reporters and the survivors as he entered and left the building.
Despite Bravik's bizarre idea of being part of a big resistance movement, the judge ruled that he was not crazy, and said that there was no proof that he was dealing with his accomplices.
Some may be comforted by the fact that the 22 July attacks seem to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the pain and confusion that the entire nation is now experiencing.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it's not," said a relative of one victim.
"It would have been a lot easier if it had been."
Seven lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the theater this week.
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared it to Henry Ford, describing a technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans can think of as the biggest discovery in a recent re-entered interview, which was recalled in the run-up to the major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and he thought he was a hippie, but he was also a thorough designer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business leaders suffered from "the pain of thinking that a really great idea is 90% of the job... [but] a great idea from a big product separates a lot of skillful work."
Let's go back to 1995, Bob Kringley created a TV series of the Triumph of Nerds about the arrival of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a uniquely long chat.
By that time, it had been about 10 years since Jobs was banished from Apple, and he was already working at his new computer company NeXT, in anticipation of the massive development of the Internet.
While a small part of Kringley's interview was used in Nerds, he says the original interview was missing in transport.
Only after Jobs' death was a full VHS copy found in the director's garage.
The film, a bit edited, was the basis for a 68-minute movie by Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which is released at Landmark Theaters on this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man who is known for his hating detailed interviews, Jobs seems unfamiliar here to express his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
There are four different moments during the interview, and there's a big gap between questions and answers -- 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs clearly weighs his mind to be more precise.
There are also moments where Jobs's perfunctory is on the surface, where he seems irritated by Kringley's questions, which make him move more quickly to questions or things of greater importance.
In the pre-Picsar era, iPods and iPhones of Lost Interview, there is something ominous prophetic, when Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies do right and wrong, and offers his own vision for the future of information technology.
It's one thing to read about the postmortem assessments of Jobs' work, but there's something fragile and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, a troubled dreamer on the brink of grandeur.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Shortly after he said it all here, he went and did it.
A small account of the seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"For all the time in the business, I've always asked, "why are you doing this?" And the answers you always get are, "Oh, it's just like this."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply in business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to detail his attempts to rationalize the records in Apple.
A disillusioned way of recording the costs, often from the “standard cost” that was taken from the ceiling and then brought up by means of a “checkout”, he created an automated structure that ensured that they would be able to track the business outlays up to the details.
About the pope's joke:
Jobs details the "Blue Box" he made with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to hack the phone company effectively and call for free long distances.
Jobs' euphoria here, when describing the blue box as an act of power is contagious.
He tells us how he and Wozniak tested the box using a phone, ordering a conversation, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We've hit the world half a dozen times, and you've been yelling at an auto phone, and it's been in a minute later on the next phone," Gobs smiled.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could build something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure all over the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could build a little thing that could control a big thing-- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that without it, Apple could ever show up.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one of the famous things that he and Wozniak almost handled by calling the Vatican via a blue box at midnight and asking for the pope's phone, trying hard to copy Henry Kissinger.
When the different members of the Catholic hierarchy were called up in the middle of the night to talk to an American diplomat, the two laughtered right before the pope himself was up to answer the phone.
The love of technology (and the cold name of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, he was after the spare parts for the frequentometer, and he found Bill Hewlett in the phonebook and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett Packard.
"This has had a strong impact on me, "it was the only company I saw at that age, "and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw the first desktop computer.
It was the size of a suitcase, it had a small monitor with an e-ray tube, and I fell in love with it.
I used to go to HP when I was a teenager, and I used to run around that car and write a program for it.
On Improvized Innovation:
In a number of places, Jobs is talking about the invention of new products for the summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of installments, a buyer asked him to pack up a full computer.
Working for 30 days on a loan, he was to plan both the assembly and the delivery of ready-made devices.
Later in Apple, he remembers the difficulties he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the raging argument... "they yelled at me that it would take five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300], "and I was fed up, "and I got out, "and I found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse we could raise for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About the big companies that lose energy:
Long before he led Apple's renaissance, Jobs foresaw exactly how many industry leaders would misunderstand the situation and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work for IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copier or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company's not getting any more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these types of people] who end up running companies, and the people who make the product are being pushed off the decision-making site.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolistic position is replaced by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
He could have been ten times the size, could have been the Microsoft of the '90s...
They've been defeated by the victories.
On innovation as a form of art:
"The great idea of a great product separates a great number of skillful work ... when you twist a great idea, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about her finesse.
There are trade-offs you need to make -- some things you can't make electrons, glass, robots, or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head -- these concepts -- tying them all together...
In the end, it's all about taste -- it's all about trying to express ourselves to the best things that humans have ever done, and then it's trying to bring it to what you do.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made MacIntosh famous was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best in information technology in the world.
If it weren't for information technology, they'd do amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are dining with the opponents of the health care law while the court is considering the case.
On the day the Supreme Court was meeting behind closed doors to discuss the politically disputed question of whether he would listen to the disclaimer of the Obama Health Act, the two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were honored at a luncheon sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the case before the High Court.
This was the case last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions.
One of the cases on the agenda was a motion supported by 26 states challenging the fast-track revision of health, passed by Congress last year, a law that united the conservative activists of the entire nation.
The judges have agreed to review the process; indeed, a five-one/2-hour turn-out is expected in March 2012 and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle to the presidential race, which will be in the middle of the time when the judgement is delivered.
The lawyer who will stand in court and claim that the health law must be repealed will probably be Paul Clement, who was the deputy attorney-general during George W. Bush's presidency.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen firms that helped to sponsor the annual lunch of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group that has consistently defended conservative legal principles.
The other company that sponsored the lunch is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was Pflizer Inc, a pharmaceutical giant, who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
Lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the trial.
There was, among other things, Mitch McConnell, a Republican leader in the Senate, and a well-known opponent of the health law.
A guest of honor at lunch?
Nothing new: two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for many years.
And this is not against ethical standards at all.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which governs the lower federal judges.
If they did, they might be subject to Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “The judge may attend the charitable activities of legal and other organizations, even though the judge may not be a rapporteur, an honorary guest, or be mentioned in the programme of such an event”.
Still, the apparent intimacy of Scalia and Thomas with two law firms in this case, as with a company with a big financial interest, was a sufficient signal to the ethics activists in the government.
“This is a staggering breach of ethics and apathy to the code is contrary to the statements of some judges that the court remains true to the same rules as all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of General Affairs.
"The judges have been drinking and dining at an official fund-raiser with the lawyers who are currently in court."
Their presence and assistance in the collection of money for this event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly draw attention to critics who say that they are very willing to mix court cases with groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a well-known conservative activist.
In fact, the Conservatives claim that this is an ethical issue for Judge Helena Kagan, not for Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in the Obama administration, when the first legal objections to the law were filed at the court of the first instance.
Her critics demanded that Kagan give up the hearing of the case, because she was too involved in the defence of the law to be fair now.
Kagan didn't show that she was gonna do it.
Boeing gets a record 18-billion-dollar plane order.
Emirates Airlines is ordering 50 wide-body Boeing 777 and may be ordering another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the deal is over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company is getting an order for 50 pieces of its product.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. jet, and the price for all of these 50 planes is $18 billion.
It's just as important where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, the growing gold mine of future plane orders.
In a Monday forecast, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend his biggest dollar-equivalent order for commercial planes, 50 two-way Boeing 777.
An incredible order was made from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy 20 more planes, which will raise the total price of US$26 billion, and Boeing said on the airshow of Dubai 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, which can show up for much better fuel saving and passenger comfort.
The price of six planes will be more than $1 billion.
"This is really very good for Boeing," said Morningstar Analyst Neil Dior.
"The quality of these particular customers is quite high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but also the increase in the price of fuel, which usually harms airlines, as it is one of the largest items of expenditure, is not so fatal, because the country is making money at high oil prices.
That's important, because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel the plane order when the prices go up, Diora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing's leadership on the market for wide-flying planes, and helps to prevent the rival Airbus SAS from attacking it with his A350 plane.
Boeing won the air show four months after Airbus announced that he would delay the debut of the biggest A350, which is rivaling with 777-300ER.
He postponed his debut to increase the axe load after the buyers demanded an increase in the volume and range of the flight.
Boeing Co's stock rose by 1.5% to $6,944.
The sister of the President of Mexico obviously lost in the Michoacana election.
Louisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealers helped Fausto Vallejo's opponent with the IRI in the run.
President Felipe Calderon's sister did not seem to have implemented her application for Governor Michoacán's seat during the brutal state elections, and she said on Monday that the drug dealers had helped to push the race for one of her opponents.
Initially, the leader of the West state governor race is called Fausto Vallejo of the Revolutionary Party, or IRI.
“The intervention of organized crime during the entire electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not just for Michoacán, but also for the entire country,” said Louise Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after the Sunday vote.
"They bullied our candidates, our election workers... "they grabbed the ballot box, put obstacles... "and made people vote" for the IRI.
The IRI ruled Mexico for seven decades, until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She's preparing for a return, and a win in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The IRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just overtaken Calderon, who led the polls up to the election day.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or a PND led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Sylvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DDP, which now owns the governor's seat, has come to the third, a major defeat for the divided and failed left in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state of Morelia, denied links to drug traffickers and called on other candidates to accept the results.
In Michoacán, drug cartels have been dominated for a long time by marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he selected Michoacán to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still on.
The mayor of the PND was killed a week before the election, when he was agitating for Louise Maria Calderon, and a number of candidates left the local race out of fear.
For the IRI, however terrible the Michokan election may look, a win will give the party a push.
The man who's supposed to be representing the IRI in the presidential race, Henrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this win should be very encouraging in the run-up to next year."
ADB is persuading Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has made India and China ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the manager of the ADB office in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing big economies must “do what they can” to speed up the recovery of the currency bloc with either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe's difficulties “impartially”, and said that Asian financial assistance side by side with European leadership and resources could help to avoid a long-term recession in the global economy.
"It's all about us."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he said to the Financial Times in an interview at the Mumbai World Economic Forum.
"Asia may be to some extent protected, but it cannot be inviolable."
"So if China and India can help, it has to be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely eroded by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowed money has been on the rise, and both Italy and Greece’s prime ministers have resigned.
The European debt crisis has engendered fears that it can bring the world economy back to recession, and has led to calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian aid would be provided through the IMF, but he said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of EU financial aid bonds, the means to secure financial stability in Europe -- was an immense bargaining power for Europe ' s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Trade of India, said that “India will do all it can to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a fall in exports and a fall in foreign capital.
"No one wants the eurozone to stay fragile and turbulent," he said.
"We have great challenges, and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a possible option, it's a mandatory condition, because where we find a job for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that there is no point in developing economies like India to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Astouche Varsny, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult politically to help Europe with 1.2 billion Indians, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point, they'll find out that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and go to the sea holiday, and it won't be well received," he said.
Lee Howell, the manager of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves needed to be used to support the many and well-remunerated Greek public-sector workers in poorly-organized, cost-effective enterprises, such as railroads.
Mr. Neg said that the eurozone crisis was threatening to have a “significant direct impact” all over Asia.
ADB’s forecast of a 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now facing “promising risks” due to a threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to draw up “emergency plans” to protect themselves from the recession and significant outflows of capital from their economies.
The Pentagon ' s fearful warnings of potential reductions in defence spending
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panetta, set the stage for the Congress on Monday, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon's corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields on the line and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon is already getting used to a $450 billion cut in the coming decade, but it is now afraid that an additional $600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress is not able to reach a cost agreement.
"The effect of these cuts will be devastating to the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the senators, Republican John McKain, Arizona, and Republican Lyndsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the Congress's failure to adopt a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequestration was leading to an overall 23% reduction and the end of many new projects.
“The so strong reduction, which has been so unthinkable, will make most of our ship-building and construction projects impractical -- you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building -- and will cause serious harm to other attempts at modernization,” writes Panetta to the senators.
"We will also have to fire many of our plain-clothes and, as the cut is to be made so fast, we will almost certainly have to fire the plainclothes to reach the goal."
"These changes will erode the trust of those who support our army and cause serious harm to our readiness."
The abbreviations will eventually affect the military, says Panetta.
“Although military financing in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the sequestration, military developments will be seriously affected by a major disruption in the basic budgets,” Panetta warned.
“Contracted personnel will be shortened, which will result in the cancellation of the contracts and the oversight contract, which supports the troops.”
“Staff will be reduced, resulting in late payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated.”
Two senators wrote to the Panetta 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible consequences of the automatic cuts in the Department of Defence.
"The effect of the sequestration in the Department of Defence will be a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We stand up to this draconian action," the senators reported in a joint statement on Monday night, when they released the Panetta letter.
"This is not the way we can live with, and this is not the way we have to impose ourselves."
“The sequestre is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen.”
Whether the Panetta's letter or the senators' last warnings will lead to a budget compromise, or the call for the release of the Pentagon from cuts, we'll see later.
The Panetta was very sincere about the possible cuts, even though he came to work at the pentagon leadership after years of budget review in Congress and the White House, and was aware that he was facing a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a depressing picture of what might follow -- troops with a shell but without a nucleus.
"This is a ship without seamen."
"This is a squad with no bullets."
"This is the wing of a plane without enough trained pilots."
"This is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings, and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission," said Panetta in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"This is a force that suffers from a fragile spirit of war, a bad will and a failure to combat potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, he described new details of how reductions “create significant transactional risks: slowing the response to crises, conflicts and catastrophes; severely limiting our ability to be the first to deploy and respond anywhere in the world; and leading to an unacceptable risk in future combat operations”.
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects can face obstacles, including those that have been tested, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 attacker, a planned new bomber, a new-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal combat ship and a new ground combat vehicle, which the Army and the Marines need to replace with a hummer.
Ending F35’s further development and testing can save 80 billion dollars in 10 years, but its supporters say that this is a vital next step to improve and confront the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to Catch on a Liar
A quick look at the last headlines shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in daily life.
A Republican presidential candidate, Herman Kane, is in the process of challenging charges of sexual harassment from a number of women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The administration of the University of Pennsylvania was charged with perjury, as they allegedly concealed that a retired football coach had raped the boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught talking to US President Barack Obama about Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu as a liar.
Lying ruins careers and shakes countries.
Congressman of New York and Internet-exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself, denouncing his actions, which was quickly rebutted by undeniable evidence.
John Edwards, a former presidential candidate, was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to conceal extra-husband relationships.
Again, none of those who lived at the time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who was found lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinski during his second term in office.
Stories of fraud at school and college exams are commonplace.
There have been times when the teachers gave the students the answers to the tests so as to have a good self-study of the results of their work.
The instructors who have to teach the contrary send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
In one day, studies show that you can lie between 10 and 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie to save.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of dating each other.
Detecting a lie or perpetrating a lie is a skill that everyone needs for both personal and professional purposes.
In contrast to a room game like, say, charades, where you need to exclaim, "I've got you!", the identification of lies is a major field of knowledge, based on the scientific data gathered in the last six decades at prestigious universities that are engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most old myths about lies have been dispelled.
Liars look in the eye.
They don't always stutter, stutter, rot, or fuss.
We should not conclude from this that the liars are hard to spot and hard to expose.
An experienced denouncer of lies can get to the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the mimics, the structure of the questions, and the temporal features.
I have spent a number of years researching scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-growing section of the knowledge of lies, and it is clear that the identification of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps to guide in our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are very good at reading others, making them feel free to control their own emotions, and intuitively feel how others view them.
We know from the study that extraverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie about others, usually to protect someone's feelings that married people lie less to their partners than to the singles (but the lie they say is more obscene).
We also know that if you are perceived as a deceitful person, others will feel less guilty by deceiving you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, watch the normal behavior of your object.
It's called the initial state determination.
This helps to provide a starting point for the assessment of changes in the future.
Watch the posture, the laughter, the voice properties of your object.
Well, if you know if a man knocks his legs in a normal state, then you won't make an unfair charge when you see his feet kicking in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for groups of deceitful verbal and non-verbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not proof of deceit.
Deceivers can fix the top of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their feet in the direction of the door, bend to the exit, change their position in a certain way, or show "reflecting after the interview" -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change of posture, when all the complex issues are behind us.
Investigators often falsify an end-of-interview signal to just look at this relief after the interview.
So, look at your object's speech.
Scott Peterson is known to have stumbled and used the past time, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, leading to a search for her all over the country.
The oppressive people can also use distance in the speech: "I didn't have a sexual relationship with this woman ... Miss Levinsky" or to repeat the complex question completely.
The most common notebook indicators are barely comprehensible.
Someone can use "qualifying language" when answering a complex question, "Okay ... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... as far as I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than de facto, and is often a red flag.
There's no magical way to detect a lie, but you can learn how to detect a lie.
These skills will increase the chances of everyone not becoming the victim of skillful cons in a professional and private life.
The controversial plan for the oil pipeline needs to be re-evaluated after the US threat to postpone its approval.
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- arousing the anger of trade unions, but calming the environmentalists -- the company that is going to build the pipeline states that it is willing to re-evaluate the project in order to resume work on it.
TransCanada announced on Monday night that it would clean up the planned oil pipeline from an ecologically sensitive area of Sand Hills in Nebraska and was sure that the project would still be approved.
The company made this decision at a press conference in the Nebraska State Capitol.
The official representative of TransCanada, Alex Purbas, said that the company remained confident that it would eventually receive approval for the oil pipeline, though with another route.
This follows a statement by the State Department last week that it will defer a decision on a project at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska Sand Hills and the Ogalala Aquifer, a massive underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental assessment ordered by the Department of State is likely to push the decision back to 2013, after the next year ' s elections, although the authorities denied that the decision was a political one.
Obama, in a written statement last week, called for a call from the State Department, and expressed his support for it.
The oil pipeline, which is 1,700 miles long, has to go from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He has to transfer 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to the Texas refinery.
To do this, he has to cross six states.
He's hated by environmentalists, but he likes trade unions that hope for some 20,000 jobs connected to the pipeline.
But Nebraska’s opponents are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the Sand Hills and Ogallala aquifer, the main source of potable water and irrigation.
The current Department of State study on the impact on the environment had shown that the project would have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but the source in the energy industry stated that the Department ' s audit had ordered a separate examination of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Eliott, who was an adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other was whether the choice of a firm that was hired to conduct an initial study was not appropriate, as it was related to TransCanada.
Patty LaBell was sued for allegedly making the kid sick out of fear.
The family in New York claims that the disco-dee Patty LaBell began raging in the lobby of their home in Manhattan, scaring their young daughter to the point of vomiting out of fear.
Tyrade "Lady Marmalade" terrorized 18-month-old Geneviève Monk so much that she suffered "many changes, sleep disorders" and "severe fear of strangers," says her family in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
This happened on November 10, last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife, a kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieve were about to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching a car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of a building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and let her daughter down for a minute.
"Someone came to me from behind and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said yes and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBell reprimanded a pregnant woman.
"She aggressively said, "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got furious and began to use swearing -- the word for C and the word for F -- in high tone ...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of a bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBell attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her escort had to hold her up and push her in the waiting car, said Rosanna Monk.
The baby was crying so bad, she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note to LaBell demanding an apology, but did not receive a response.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBell are not answering the phone for comment.
The amount of compensation for the harm was not reported, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he had taken up the case free of charge and that the family was planning to donate any money that he would receive to charity to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patty LaBell take responsibility for what he has done," said Davis.
"This behaviour is absolutely unacceptable, especially with regard to the caregiver of an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climatic problems have slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López's rule in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market rose, foreign financing declined, and the economy was weakened.
2011 - The year that will be part of Sinaloa ' s economic history as associated with the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, also referred to as the year of change, which has given rise to high hopes for economic development, but given the adverse climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there has been no growth, but there has been a decline in the main economic development indicators.
Not only have the low temperatures of February led to the loss of millions in the agricultural sector, but they have restricted the growth potential of the public economy, leading to a total decline of 3.6 per cent in economic activity in the first half of the year, largely due to the historic fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to a report on areas affected by seams provided by the Council for Sustainable Rural Development of Mexico, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78,03 per cent were affected, while the remaining 21,07 per cent were partially affected.
The decline in economic activity has led to a constant rise in the state ' s unemployment rate up to November, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters, an accelerated increase in the rate of unemployment, from January to March 55.053 Sinaloa residents were unemployed, with a share of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, in the second quarter the rate rose to 5.28 per cent, and from July to September it continued to grow to 6.19 per cent, a proportion that is more than 74,000 unemployed Sinloa people, an increase of 18.969 more than the first half.
Diminishment of liquidity
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa over the course of the year has been overwhelmed by a number of factors, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, the director of the Department of Economics and Social Science of the Autonomous University (UAS), the rise in unemployment can be attributed indirectly to the actions taken in public policy.
"What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to a number of factors, including the loss of market liquidity to limit the resources imposed by the law, which was adopted in Congress to combat money-laundering, as it is not easy for people who are illegally possessing dollars to work with them, invest and use them in something," he said.
Stopped Immigration
Lopez Cervantes said that there was also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad has been restricted in the United States, primarily because of the difficulty of entry, and in the second, because once they enter, they already face a lot of difficulty in finding work, so that a group of people stay and demand jobs here in the state, as a result, the unemployment rate grows," he said.
Violation of formal requirements
Analysing the Sinaloa labour market is getting worse when we look at the high number of labour-stabilities, according to INEGI, 60,38% of the active population of the state is working without being mentioned as employees in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregularity, a further reminder of the state ' s work is given by low wages; in the state, the lowest wage in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was up to September 5,352 peso, much lower than the national average of 7,375.
FDI reduction
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate, the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the past 10 years, according to the Department of Finance, was $630,697 from January to July. This represents a decline of 87.74 per cent, compared to $5,143,312 over the same period last year.
For its part, the State Government's Department of Economic Development has recorded only 17,280,000 peso-investment in the year, which has largely been the result of service companies.
Duty
Against the background of the economic downturn, the state government in July requested the approval of a 3-billion-peso loan to be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, at the local level, a total of 2,600 million peso was approved, and until November the debt was not expected in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For businessmen, Mario López Valdez's first year of government demonstrates a lack of government capacity.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, President of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that there was a lack of agreement on the wishes of the various sectors, including the state government itself, during 2011.
"The efficiency of the Sinaloa economy this year has been really low, we have to work hard to get back the positions we lost this year, we have to redouble our efforts in 2012, we have not been able to agree on the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
The slowing down of the economy
López Loredo said that events such as the early freezes this year stopped the state economy and its efficiency and growth were limited.
“The low size of the economy is the result of a number of events, including the frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy, which is not getting fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services, and, therefore, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations,” he said.
Revision of heading
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state needed to continue its most dynamic productive activity.
“In general, we have found that we have been working on this, we believe that there is a need to develop a long-term programme that will rethink the direction and economic course of the state, and to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has,” he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coparmex stressed the importance of setting the future direction to better guide the Government.
“In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in a number of areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme,” he said.
He noted that the current Administration had shown progress in its own manner of public policy.
"There are facts that enable us to say that the government is starting to get involved in the work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government is aware that much more needs to be done," he said.
He's being sentenced for 8 kg of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days ' worth - a sentence was handed down to a national of Navolato for possessing eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Office of the Attorney-General reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who had been convicted of a crime against health, was in this case possessing marijuana for the purpose of distribution.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI case, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during patrolling Cypruso Valdez Street, in front of Post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pick-up car, in which he was carrying a black bag in a box in a car, and on the passenger seat a small backpack, where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizure was transferred to the Second Regional Court, and the accused is still incarcerated at the Support Centre for the Legal Consequences of Crime.
We need to make contributions to our work.
Public works related to such programmes as the Homeland, the Salvation of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants risk being left unfinished or put on hold for a long time due to a lack of funds, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that, while the work programmes have been developed so far, they are at risk, as the state Government is not in a position to make the relevant contributions, which is more than 11 million peso for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes was about 50 million pesos, of which the State was expected to contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for work, so it is still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they don't give us a penny when from the beginning of July they should have given us a part," he said, "to keep up, we've started work, and they've made a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, under Jesus Aguilar Padilla's rule, the state had not made the contributions it was due to make, so at the start of the term, the municipality had to borrow more than 7 million dollars to cover the sum that the State administration had not provided in that case.
"This happened to us in the previous administration, because the state didn't have the financial means to participate, and the programs continued to grow, and this year, in order to get access to these programs, we need to find the resources to cover what the state has left," he explained.
While the state authorities had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to step up their efforts so that interest on them would come as soon as possible.
"They have to make up almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they don't give us a penny."
The court will approve a “transition to digital TV” in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogues with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court (JC) rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which is moving the so-called “ Digital Television” from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes required for its annulment have not been obtained.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, considered that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree detailing the action to move to digital ground television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate have been rejected because of the absence of a qualified majority of the eight votes required for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft declaration, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed that the decree be declared unconstitutional, since the regulation of the radio and television programme was a right established by law for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Marguerite Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
On this point, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to disprove the decree and support the complaints, and Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to in it regarding the transfer to digital broadcasting.
It was also decided at the Ministerial Meeting to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies without taking part in the discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he was not in agreement with the argument of the project in the sense that the federal executive cannot set out the general rules for the measures to be prepared by the public administration.
“I also do not believe that, if this had been the case, it would have affected the autonomy of the regulator” and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is relevant to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, the administration of the State.
Changing analogues to digital signals, one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years, has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better quality of the signal, and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would mean postponing the benefits of transforming into a digital form, which includes meeting public needs, which have not just a technical dimension, “as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues”.
These questions, he said, “requests the work of the entire system of public economic governance to include a group of authorities, which the Constitution unites into the State executive”.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and had done so with the help of the executive, despite the existence of highly specialized technical institutions.
From this it cannot be concluded that the Government, by adopting the decree in question, which in any event affects the competence of the Congress, ensures, in the administrative sphere, the observance of the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he has said.
In Michoacana, analyzing the possibility of counting a "vote-by-vote"
The difference between the first and the second seats in the Governor ' s election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 per cent of the total of 6.074 records.
The possibility of counting a “vote-for-vote” is real, as far as this year's electoral process in Michoacán is concerned, where, according to the Provisional Results Programme (PPP), the difference between the first and second seats in the Governor's elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the 879 of the 6.774 records.
In the light of this, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Institute for Elections (IVM), Maria de Los Angeles Lianderal Saragosa, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the Electoral Corps approved a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacán has not adopted the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Electoral Law Act, as the State Congress approved the reforms just before the legal time frame for their entry into force in this electoral process, and the Governor, Leonel Godoy Rangel, has not included its publication within the time-limit set out in the Act in the State Official Gazette, stating that he has some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JJJJ) ruled on a constitutional claim made by the local legislature and called the state representative's vote on constitutional reform “unvalid and illegal”, as it has no right to “permit or support it”.
In an interview on the possibility of a “vote-for-vote vote”, Maria de los Ángeles Landeral argued that with the adoption of the appropriate principles by the General Council of IWM, it would be possible to present a partial or complete count of the votes by the local electoral authority.
For example, a partial recalculation of one or more ballot boxes can be made on the condition that: the results of the records are not the same; there is no record of the balloting and the calculation of the documents in the urn or it is not in the hands of the chairman; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the record.
In addition, a total recount of the votes in all the urns in the elections may take place when there is a sign that the difference between the presumed winner of the elections in question and the second-best candidate is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the representative of the party and/or the coalition who put out the second of the candidates in question.
The total recount will also be made if, at the end of the normal count, it is determined that the difference between the winner and the second-place candidate is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party, whose candidate has been the second-place candidate, in the event that the ballot boxes, which have been taken into account in the partial recalculation, are excluded.
It is worth noting that this is the case in Morellia, where, according to PDRP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 per cent, even if there are 129 votes out of a total of 923 protocols.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam.
The remains of the pilot, Felipe Basio Cortez, arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening; on Monday, an examination and a resting Mass was carried out.
According to the family, the last will of the Lt. Colonel was to scatter his ashes in the Sapalinam Mountains.
After receiving sympathies with other people who died in the disaster, the Basio Cortes family returned to the capital city of Coahuila on board a Mexican Air Force aircraft, and the closest people attended a ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived at the chapel on the Nazario Boulevard Ortiz Garcia, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 a.m., he was screened by the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and the football team, of which Felipe Basio was a member during his high school.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and that his ashes should be scattered in the Sapalinama Mountains, he always said it to his family and friends," was what Sandra Cortés Basio, the pilot's sister, told.
In her view, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she thinks he was at the top of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son, and a loving brother, loyal to his family."
Felipe Cortés Basio, a very young man, left Saltillo to join the Aeronautical College in Sapopana, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe him, they said he was dizzy even in a truck, but he always wanted to live up to his dream of being a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he got to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to welcome him, like when he brought Martha Sagan to Saltillo."
The boy remembers that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopan to attend the certificate ceremony of his relative, so he knows that his uncle died, doing what he loved most in life: driving a plane.
He's on his last way.
Shots were fired in the name of Lt. Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortez Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres Lopez, people from the village and state government, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Saltillo School of Technology, where he studied in 1985, and made progress in both his studies and his sports, taking him on the last path.
Basio Cortés was recently killed when the helicopter he was driving fell down, together with the Secretary of Government of the Province, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all the representatives of the Ministry.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of Basio Cortés (created), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over by the funeral office to the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major James Martinez, to the Esplanade of the Training School, where his family was already waiting for him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, Christina, her mother, her brothers and other relatives, his students and his teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned at the NL Caderate Farm.
A few hours before the detection, the military authorities had shown to the media 11 people who had been detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the city of Cadereita Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery was found on a 1.5-km Cadereita Highway in the direction of Santiago, on a hill in a commune known as El Castillo.
A few passersby noticed that in a village house, with a wall painted in beige and brown, the gate was open.
Looking inside, just three meters away, they found the bodies of three men, and they immediately let the authorities know.
One of the men wore a yellow t-shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and there was another man in a white t-shirt next to him.
Almost one metre was the body of another man, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three of them lay face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere, as there were no shell casings on the scene.
On the outskirts of the village house, there are signs addressed to one organized criminal group by another, and there are several bullet holes in the gate.
11 caught in Cadet
The Ministry of National Security has represented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group, which was mainly in the city of Cadereita, and who are charged with kidnapping, murder, “fraud” and secret graves.
According to published information, eight people were initially detained in the Los Alvero Colony on 11 November, and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a phone, demanding that they become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event took place on November 12, at 0600, and the military made a roundabout at the Old Ranch in Cadereita, when they saw a car without license plates with two men in the salon.
After stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, a bullet and 18 rounds.
Later, on 13 November, at 2 p.m., one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Truth, who, when he saw the military, was trying to escape.
He is charged with secret graves in the municipalities of General Teran, Hina and Cadereita.
A new Italian Government will be set up on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present a new government that will face the crisis that put this country on the verge of an economic catastrophe.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet with the Italian President on Wednesday to present a new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the verge of an economic catastrophe and has harmed the entire eurozone.
A statement from the Presidential Palace stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he could form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet, drawn up mainly from technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive body will take up its positions.
Monty said that he would submit to the President the results of his negotiations with the political parties in his attempt to form a Government.
"I want to prove my full confidence in my country's ability to get out of this difficult period," said the former European Commissioner to reporters.
Monty didn't say he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"Study is now well-designed," he said.
Monty completed the Government-building process in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy was struggling with the political and financial crisis, which brought their debt to a critical level.
The administration, led by the former European Commissioner Monty, must approve the austerity package required by European leaders in order to restore confidence in Italy.
On the basis of the pressure on Monty to hasten it, unstable markets have set up a 10-year profit from the BTP bonds of Italy over 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marchegalia, the leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told the reporters after the meeting with Monty, "We said we would actively support this government."
We believe that this Government is Italy's last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monty’s chances of success were largely based on the support of the Sylvio Berlusconi LDP party, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said Angelino Alphano, the secretary of the Central-Right Party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important, for so far many of its members have resisted the government majority of technocrats that form Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Monty government must have strong parliamentary support for reform, which is likely to be unpopular reforms of austerity.
Any blocking or halting of these attempts can lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has stepped up pressure, warning Monty that Monty’s failure can be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women ' s organizations.
He'll end a series of his meetings on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday, Napolitano, who resolved a very fast transition in response to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would be retiring, the value of Italy’s debt has now reached a critical level in the face of uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister will be successful.
Salvaging Italy with a public debt of Euro1.8 billion would be too much for modern euro-zone financial defenders.
Monty said that his Government would be in place until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the widespread predictions that the politicians would give him time to reform before he could appoint a new election.
Monty said he'd like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist that it should be composed only of technical experts, a sign of their dissatisfaction with the fact that the financial situation is affecting the process.
Political sources reported that the mutual distrust and dissent of the parties made it more difficult to try to include political figures.
The Spaniards have more game experience than the Ticos.
Of the 22 players declared in Spain, 10 have played 50 international games.
For Costa Rica, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 games.
A small contrast with Costa Rica, when compared to the 22 players who were called by both countries to a friendly match today at 3:05 a.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While world and European champs have one in FIFA's monthly ratings, there's a whole list of class A qualifiers, Tricolor has only Michael Ouman's defender as the only one who's played 50 international games.
This figure was achieved last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernandez Stadium.
The Spanish footballers, who play in the League of All Stars and in the strong club of the British Premier League, have been very active in the leagues and in local Cups this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Champions.
To that, the experience of the Spanish Fury in the complex qualifications of the European Union or the World Cup should be added.
The players, however, have limited international experience in an area such as CONCAQAF, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that he is running a list for the Spanish Hollywood team, Icker Kasillas, who last Sunday against England (the mutch played 0-1 in London) re-entered Andoni Subisarret's record with 126 international matches.
Kasillas will play against Tricolor today and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernandez, a player in Barcelona, has 106 matches.
Kasillas and Javi were found to be the best UEFA in the last week, together with another player in the Iberian team, Subisarret, with 126 matches and a bombarder, Shalke Raul Gonzalez, with 102.
It's close to a hundred Carles Puilles with 97 games.
Javi Alonso has been following them since 91, Fernando Torres from 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both from 81, Andres Inesta from 62, Sesk Fabregas from 61, and David Silva from 53.
On the Costa Rican side of Michael Umana, on the left side of Junior Díaz with 48 matches, and on the other hand, the bomber Brian Ruiz with 45.
Next, there are only five over 30 games: Cailor Navas from 31, Randall Asofef from 32, Michael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Hernández from 36, and José Luis Lopez from 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain for Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Bousquetsa (36), Santiago Santi Kasorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiola (31).
There's Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25, and Roy Murey with 23.
The rest didn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Morelia has only four, and Hordy Alba has two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet debuted.
The leading player in Spain, David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres since 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the one who brought more points, twice as much as Carlos Hernández and three times as much as Roy Murry and Parks.
Quintette put the country on a 20-year career tour.
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true."
In an exclusive interview with Viva bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam, he said the band was ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band says it's also a dream for them to play in this country.
This was an allegation by a bassist and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is in South America as part of a 20-year tour and on Sunday, the 20th, will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will play at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., together with a team from Los Angeles, The X, and a local band, Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from an interview that is fully decrypted online on The Nation.
For your fans from Costa Rica, is it a dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.
This is just our second visit to South and Central America, and so far it's going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once - on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we're very happy to get our music there.
I'm asking because there's some loyalty to the band; fans live in a lot of stress on the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long, and we're sorry it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, think of it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a bit of tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest show we've played in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We've done some great show in São Paulo, and we hope this has led us to form for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How do you know about Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfing friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as in Mexico, it's a great place to surf, so we've learned about it, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say you've made a grand show with a lot of songs.
What are you planning to do in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we have no limit on what we can do.
We're gonna try to make the best show possible with a wide range of songs; we're gonna try to play a couple of songs from each album, and we're gonna give our fans a lot of repertoire.
You never repeat a repertoire.
How do you do that?
I think, in part, it's because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in a tone, and it surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we might forget.
It makes the show more interesting to us, and so I think it makes it more interesting to people.
This is a 20-year tour.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yeah, absolutely.
First, I think none of us ever imagined we'd be in a rock band and that we've been doing this for over 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We enjoy our luck, and we are very encouraged that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We're happy to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go to.
It's a very good thing for us.
What does it mean for you to be a big part of the bloom of the gronze?
It's always been an honor to be part of this group of great groups.
We're good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney, and Alice in Chains.
It's cool when a movement grows up from a group of friends, and it's unusual.
From time to time, one group from the same city emerges, but much more odd when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We're proud and it's an honor to be part of a band from Seattle.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them, and it's an honor to be part of the sound of Seattle that got out.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stays together and in the same group for so long.
Yeah, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than there are many groups.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and secondly, we care about others.
We are all very close friends, and as a result, music roads have also been opened, giving everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't have been better.
Your view of the word was not easy; but thanks to your success, you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find the balance?
When we grew up, it was easier to find a balance.
We care not to be on tour too long, because it's easy to get into this game by the big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect the music and what made it, not to be a celebrity or a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
What do you remember about your other project, "Manother Love Bone"?
I think we're writing really good songs, and at the start, it was great.
We've been a band for almost three years, and we haven't released any albums until Andy's death.
There was a lot of disappointment, because it's been so long, and the most important thing is that we're still close friends with Bruce (Ferweser) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or see a picture, I think of an incredible man who was Andy, and how he made me laugh, it's always been a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football, and a lot of things.
He was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and so you chose it to open up?
Yeah, the producers sent us a couple of videos, and it was a band we liked the most, so we're looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can do live, and it must be very exciting.
Why do you always change the word in Yellow LedBetter at the concerts?
That's a question to Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he's using the first thing he can think of.
Who made you a bass player?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind, Giser Butler, John Antwhistle, C.J. Ramon, John Dow, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them I can talk all day about the bassians I love.
How has Pearl Jam been successful in keeping the gem relevant, even though it is no longer fashionable?
I think we're all feeling a bit detached from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhony, Soundgarden, and Nirvana, and all of those that have come up at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful, because it's the music that's worth listening to, and the bands like Mudhony are now making music better than ever.
At first, your music was more grim, and now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are considered very gloomy, though they may sound a little positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, and the songs were very gloomy.
I think when you're growing up, and there's been some kind of trauma in your life, and you've lost a family member or a friend, these events are starting to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect it for me.
So I think you can be a happy man and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for a medical examination.
Ex-President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at the State Hospital, and his family doctor told him to check for the loss of muscle in his legs.
Fujimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his administration (1990-2000) suffers from a number of diseases, including language cancer, which has led to his operation four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV channel N that Fujimori would be screened in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of power in his lower extremities.
Aginaga said that in his view Fujimori should be a candidate for the benefit of a pardon for humanitarian reasons; however, he said he didn't want it because he knew he was innocent.
He's had four tests on language cancer, he's lost 18 kilograms of weight, and he's got other diseases, such as a strong erosion gastreet, pancreas cysts, kidney rocks, high blood pressure, and a problem with blood in his legs, a doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Police Department of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the army ' s extermination unit, which operated in secret during the first years of his rule.
Mujika is going to Mexico to fortify political ties
An official delegation led by the President of Uruguay, José Muhika, and made up of a number of ministers and businessmen, will come to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to start negotiations on the political problems of the region.
Mujika will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, the most important item in the plan to meet with the political, commercial and Uruguayan communities in Mexico, according to a timetable published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two Presidents in Guadalajara will be “favourable for the exchange of information on political relations between the two nations”, as the South American leadership has published on its website.
According to the local media, Mujica is seeking support for Uruguay in an incident with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy listed the South American country as a tax haven at a G20 meeting in the French city of Canne.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remained tax havens, a statement that had led to Uruguay ' s protest and the withdrawal for his ambassador ' s consultations in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20, a group of the most developed and developing countries since November, and has, in fact, an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Government of Uruguay has in recent years tried to speed up the conclusion of tax-exchange agreements in order to leave the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's grey list, drawn up from countries that do not enjoy international standards of tax cooperation.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
The mustard plumber will be three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from Bouser's evil paws, but he's never done it in three dimensions before: in Super Mario 3D Land, he's gonna fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will be available in shops all over the world this month, has been created on the basis of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which can play in three dimensions without the need to use points.
"Mario is a hero who has to tell us how stereoscopying will work without a point," said Nintendo, head of the press in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first Nintendo video game specially designed for this platform" because, to date, successful products such as Star Fox 64 3D or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" were the adaptations to the existing game.
The representative of Nintendo said that, despite the existence in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "reachable" video game that would enjoy a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" has two games in one: the first part is "simple", to attract less experienced users.
On one occasion, most experts will go "in the second round" to the levels of the game, which are more complex this time.
Also, users can choose, in real time, between "D Aggressive" or something that only affects the depth of the action, but that needs to be played in three dimensions to overcome a wide range of obstacles and "do not give in to the optical illusions."
This three-dimensional Super Mario invasion also marks the return of the hero to the portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the show and repeats the successful formula from the previous games, a plumber with a mustache has to go through the dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
But the player will find new movements, decorations, suits and enemies, as well as Luigi's "player."
Coke guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process of Alfonso Portillo had begun so that he would respond in the United States for a conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This is the end of the process in which Guatemala responded to a request from the northern country for Portillo to be extradited to be tried there.
At a press conference, Kolom said that his decision related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, given that the court of first instance had already signed an extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate, he had not “handed hands” on legal decisions and had accepted all the extradition procedures he had ever known of.
With Portillo Sergio Roano Marrokin, he will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Kolom has done shows the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted with a view to prosecuting the ex-heads of the State from 2000 to 2004.
Pursuant to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CPC), Portillo will be extradited once, with a decision on his legal position in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found not guilty of the Q120 million embezzlement in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a pre-removal process, but the Ministry of Public Relations filed an appeal and reopened the case.
Trijove helped 6,000 at-risk young people
The organization was set up to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of the Trijove social support organization are important: 6,000 young people who are prone to social exclusion have been able to cope with the challenges of this quarter-century.
It is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was an occasion for a ceremony in the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijov was born next to the Villa Trinitat in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, a lack of work, and problems with drugs or marginalized.
Yesterday's Sant Andreu celebration brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have been working with the association over the past 25 years.
The different political representation during the elections revealed the unified character of the work done by Trijove.
After the President of the Generality, Arthur Mass, and his predecessor, Hordi Puhol, the ex-advisor of the Socialist entity, Ernest Maragal, and the ex-leutenant of the mayor and the current eco-socialist, Ricarard Gom, a member of the municipal council, attended the ceremony.
He also appeared in Fabra I Coats, a current social welfare and family adviser, Josép Lewis Cleris, and the CoEO for social work at La Caixa, Homee Lanapa.
He said that Trinijov was born in a very difficult time, and that the current period was also a difficult one, but he added that the work done so far was "a good base."
The Chairman cited Trinijov as an example of the struggle against bad circumstances and the instilling of hope in people in difficulty.
"Crisis is not new to the organization and work done to her," he said.
Captured building, where mass parties were organized, evacuated
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of a building on Balmes Street, 51
The 12 occupiers left the building yesterday at noon without a fight.
It seems that the nightmare of the neighbors who live in the 51st Street of Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people left the building yesterday at noon, which they illegally occupied, and where they organized mass parties that irritated the neighbours, by a court order, without the intervention of the police.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a relapse.
"As of now, there will be a pass check," the manager said.
The scooters, who took 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest of the building was inhabited, took all the electricity and part of the water, painted the walls, and left traces of all sorts, especially of liquor cans.
The first three floors were a mass party site, which lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Right behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income has fallen by 80 per cent.
The owner of the club says the invaders of the building got her into an unfair competition, because they sold drinks for three euro, while at the club for ten.
In addition, the discotheque owner was to respond to the complaints of the neighbors about the noise, although she observed that the noise was caused not by the club's visitors, but by the people in the squats, and above all by those who attended the parties there, the frequency and intensity of which had increased, as the angry neighbors said.
The owner of the club said the inconvenience was so big, she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months, he's "forgave" her rent.
The City Police also confirmed that in recent weeks, more complaints had been received from the neighbours about the situation.
The chairman of the PP municipal group, Alberto Fernand Díaz, demanded last week “to evacuate the building immediately to address the problems of co-existence and shared spirit of the neighbours and degradation in this area”.
The popular leader explained that, until the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but in the last few months, squatters had invaded all floors and almost every room, and that in some of them there had been break-ins.
In this sense, he added that “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to stand firm against the culture of the building”.
So, yesterday, the police evacuated a building in Noo Barris.
At 3:30, the police left for Montral Street, 35 after getting a call from a neighbor who saw four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree with the possibility of a contest after the contrition of contributions
The 16-door municipal pageant reopened the debate on the role of Colcerola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the rise of the now-dead Barcelona Capital Corporation (BCC), this administration has been putting out posters for Kolserola.
The Booklet described the mountain as a big park in Barcelona.
In fact, this was accompanied by a comparison in images with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the SSC, in 1987, the park re-entered into the mind of many as the highest point in Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that are not focused on the north-south, but on the up (mount) - down (the sea).
The positioning of Colcerola as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar as a Yogi bear.
That was until September, the council announced a massive competition, consisting of 16 competitions for a lot of other gates to Kolcerola.
The gate means the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put the gates on the field.
The question is, Colserola, a park or a mountain?
The competition, and its organizational side, and its impact on the city, is a subject for discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
It's almost the most repetitive subject to be discussed when two members of this chosen clan know each other in the elevator.
And this fact brings exactly one of the few overlaps between what the three architects of Barcelona say and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: The competition is appropriate
For Roldan, once the coastline has been reached, it becomes “necessary” to discuss the “front side of the mountain” when the offer of Ildefon Serda, a mountain with green apples, has not been implemented.
"We have to assume that Barcelona's biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, because of its excellent availability.
The colserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the heading of the Colserola Gate contains a "word trap": we should not think of them "as the entrance to the park, but as limiting some of the areas where we have to act."
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayona, with experience in urban construction, called the proposal a “intellectual task” with “some dangers”.
Risks arising from the “uncertainty of public space foresight” after the experience of the 1980s, which ended on the Forum site with a “swan song”.
The first fear is the very limiting of the boundaries where you can build.
"Limitation of something is the preparation of the next step," means a transition.
"We have to think about new urban planning instruments, because current [in the case of the Capital Master Plan (GSP)] can lead to real trouble."
Closer to the point, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Kolcerola Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographic question.
Modolo remembers that there is already work done outside of Calcerola, which "do not miss the ear," although he is grateful for the opportunity that the City Hall is offering for his profession to join the project "from the start."
And what's more, he realizes that the proximity of a mountain to a city is a pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but he's "he's in doubt" about whether this technical profile is what he's supposed to be leading the interdisciplinary teams ("success," he states), which was supposed to create: "The architects should be just an instrument."
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that asks the name of this part is complex, because the rules of the competition do not contain a common form of Colserola: "The 16 intersecting competitions have been announced," he says, "in the sense of the sea-mount, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the whole area."
This has led, at least in his case, to 16 competitions.
On the other hand, a project for one gate can cross the program and the design of an architect for the next gate.
From your point of view, the council has to guarantee that the bandage right over Rhonda de Dalta should provide in its completeness an area equipped to make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The Casino pardons Jonas Larrasabal and he will be freed.
After 72 days of settlement, the court representative, Red Casino, pardoned the brother of the mayor of Monterrey on a charge of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be free after the legal representative, Red Casino, has pardoned him to the Second Criminal District Court, which is in the process of extorting the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombardment of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photographs and videos, in which Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic contribution to allow the Monterey authorities to allow a secret operation in the gaming house.
After a public conviction, the Public Prosecutor opened a criminal case against the mayor ' s brother, and on 2 September, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Department of Inheritance, he was sent to a temporary prison in the old state capital.
He remained at this location for 49 days, following the second order to prohibit transfer, after the prosecutor had ruled out the offences of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereita for allegedly extorting half a million peso from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in a prison with a moderate isolation of the inmates because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his stay at the San Nicholas municipal prison in Garza.
On 25 October, the arrest order was issued by Jorge Janes, the registrar of the Second Criminal Court, who said that, after almost two months of investigations, there was a clear proof of Jonas' guilt, such as the levying of 1.5 million peso from the bookies in exchange for permission of the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to ask for pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region, so he could be free in the next hours.
During the court hearing, the Public Prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez if he had compensated for the damage and who of the partners in the gaming house would grant a pardon, even though the lawyer was trying to keep his name off the table.
On the basis of a record of 197/2011, a legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and no statements could be made about the process that had been planned against him; nor would any compensation or punishment be required.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookie, at about 3:50 p.m., Larrasabal Breton was ordered to be released immediately.
The court officer, Jorge Janes, went to the San Nicholas prison in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally pardoned and his case would be closed.
He will also inform him of an immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Perez Hacome describes the details of the disaster, where the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, was killed, and seven others.
The Minister of Communications and Transport (MTS) reported that the results of the accident, in which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others had been killed, had shown that the helicopter had hit the ground in a state of complete integrity, without the pilot attempting to land an accident.
During a press conference, Dionysio Perez Hacome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot found out that the weather conditions were fit for flight.
"Elements that seem to show that the ship has had a number of contacts with the ground, the wings have come into contact with the trees at 25 meters, where the medium has lost the flue."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, and accordingly it met the necessary requirements for the transport of persons.
He also said that the studies carried out in the area of impact did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
"The study states that there are no components of the vessel in another place, the impact has occurred in a state of structural integrity.
"The helipad was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant requirements for the transport of passengers.
The Earth in this place has a slope of between seven and 30 degrees.
So far, the secretary said, the main thing is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study can take a few months or even a year.
In the meantime, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the attack, the presidential helicopter was driven at cruise speed and that it was on a soft, uplifting ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of a normal summer manoeuvre at the moment of impact," he said.
At a press conference, the owner of SCT, Perez Hacome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the air rules, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means the crew has to be visible during the flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports identified suitable conditions for take-off when the aircraft was heading to the border between the city of Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where the clouds were visible at low altitudes.
Choosed routes:
It's possible that because of the cloud conditions, the team was looking for a lower and more visible zone in the Cuernavac Valley.
Shot point.
The coordinates of the attack and the last record from the aircraft's radar are likely to be the same, with no loss of control or a change of direction prior to the attack.
Scatter of fragments in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact was on the front and side lines.
The dispersion of the rubble indicates that the helicopter ran into the ground in a structurally integrity environment.
There were no obvious signs of fire or explosion:
In the disaster zone, there is undiscovered evidence in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent studies have shown that there may have been multiple contacts with the land.
During work on the ground, fragments of an aircraft were found at a height of 9,200 feet above sea level, and the ground has a slope of between 7 and 30 degrees.
The images show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to show that the helicopter may have had a number of collisions with the ground.
After a thorough study in more territory than the demarcated zone near the site of the disaster, no fragments of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the attack took place in a context of structural integrity.
MSS announces an obesity gene search program
Social protection leads a study on the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect the obesity gene in children and young people, the protocol “Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescence”, which will provide an estimate of signs of overweight.
In his statement, the head of the Biochemistry Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Centre of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dietologists and social workers had been assembled.
The team is supported by specialists and postgraduates from the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Centre for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (prepared or not) is invited to take part in the MSSI sports centres participating in the study, to the Valley of Mexico City, where every Saturday, from 8 a.m., a test will be carried out with the participation of children.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to run at a sports centre in Cuautemok (West of Mexico) and that, since 8 October, the events had been held at a sports centre in Nesaualcovotl (east of Mexico City).
Once the target of 500 to 600 children has been met, the study will be continued at the Independence Sports Centre (south of Mexico City) and, finally, at the Morelos Sports Centre (north of Mexico City).
He explained that the aim of the study was to understand the components and importance of genetics for the development of obesity and to identify risk factors among children and young Mexicans in order to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, World Diabetes Day will be observed, and the main aim is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of 6 and 14, with the permission and supervision of their parents, to complete their individual dietary questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that result in diseases such as diabetes or renal infirmity.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometry of all participants (weight, growth and waist cover), blood pressure and levels of glucose, fats, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis (to identify the genes associated with child obesity) would be carried out.
Crus Lopez said that the study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in the weight of children.
Medical studies carried out between 1999 and 2006 show that there has been an increase in only 6 years: 77 per cent in the case of boys, 47 per cent in the case of girls; overweight, there has also been a significant increase,” said MSSI.
He said that the validity of the search for markers was based on the fact that the population was different from other peoples in their genetic history.
He reported that, on average, he was 65 per cent of the American Indians, 30 per cent of the Europeans, and 5 per cent of the Africans, a condition that affected the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the main effect of obesity genetics is the inability of the body to burn the excess of energy that we are consuming (calories) and it is postponed in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the participants was a comprehensive assessment of children, which could determine whether they had any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, having a dark stride on the neck (matters) and forearms means the risk of a metabolism or even a pre-diabeth.
The information is given in full secrecy, and the doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the dimensions and changes in the way of life that must be taken to avoid the disease.
Crus Lopez explained that there are three main reasons for overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sit-down, or a lack of daily physical activity, a lot of the day at home in front of the TV, and the use of small distances of transport instead of walking.
It is also due to the high use of calories, i.e. the increase in the use of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tams, bread, pizzas, hamburgers, etc.) with high levels of fat and protein, and the genetic predisposition analysed in this program.
Asphalt UNAM can avoid cracks
Raphael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Department of Chemistry, has developed a polymer-modified bitumen to make a mix of best quality resistant to the environment and temperature.
If the signals sent by the road cover had been given attention, it would have been necessary to renovate about 200,000 holes for each rainy season in the Metropolitan Valley, says Rafael Herrera Nahera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Department, and adds that if the process of construction and maintenance of the asphalted road cover is correct, the number of holes can be reduced or reduced to zero.
In his lecture, a technical view of the pits, read in the context of the International Year of Chemistry, states that the laboratory for which it is responsible is developing a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mix of properties close to the bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen can be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the North, to improve the quality of the roads and thus to resist the formation of a hole.
He explained that the bitumen, the hardest part of the oil, was a sequencing of hydrocarbon molecules, some of it was a high molecular mass, called asphalts, and some of it was a low molecular mass, called maltens, which together provided a road cover for its characteristic viscosity.
The viscosity of the bitumen is the fact that in high-temperatures about 180 degrees it behaves like a liquid, at 120 of its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it stays almost solid, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance of the street asphalt is not permanent, but changes over the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, by a chemical engineer.
The chemist observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered with a flexible cover, which is made up of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the top layers is a bitumen made of small rocks, put into bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that forms this surface, he said, is sunk in bitumen.
In the case of transport and effort, this helps the forces to be very well distributed on the road surface.
If it was a modified asphalt, they'd be even better distributed, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt cover, he added, the last layer, which is called a decomposition layer, made of a small stone, in fact sand also immersed in asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will be in contact with the wheels of transport, it should have more resistance than asphalt cover and provide for road friction.
As part of the road surface, which will receive and distribute this effort, the wear layer also requires the proper thickness, and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
The weather, especially the humidity and temperature changes, are also very important for consideration, especially water, he said, because it has a significant effect on the state of asphalt.
When the land is raw, the water penetrates the surface, and it's hard to get out of it, it's softening all the layers of the surface, and so the formation of a hole.
In the formation of a hole, he said, the first thing to erode is a layer of wear and then it will affect the bitumen, but the damage does not happen instantly, a process that should be taken into account in the first signs of a maintenance program.
A member of the National Research System also explained that transport is another important factor in the creation of holes, so the thickness of each layer of the surface should always be linked to the transport load and must be guaranteed to meet this requirement in order to prevent the frequent occurrence of a hole.
Raphael Herrera said that a lot of bitumen still has to be studied and done, for example, bitumen emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries and even help to fix holes lightly and without the use of high temperatures.
What's not enough for a candidate from Valle to become a new Miss Columbia?
Analysing the reasons that prevented Serne Melina Ramirez from getting the crown of Miss Columbia.
The representative of Valle won the title of Princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca has only to want the crown of Miss Columbia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Cerna was to be content to be on the runway of the victors with a silver crown and a ribbon declaring her the new princess of Colombia.
On the basis of the outcome of last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and scepter, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown, but who were declared Princesses, including Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Patrice Belini Ayal (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Layla Blanquez (88), Monica Evers (89), Maria Sonsuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romeo (1993), Hisei Alhore Garces (2000), Catalina Hiraldo (2007), Stefanie Garces Alhur (2008).
The question that many now ask:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, who in every performance demonstrated that she has everything to be a new Miss Columbia, for a reason, she was chosen Queen of the Police and the most beautiful face in Vogue, titles that the Queens, such as Tatiana Vargas or Natalie Navarro, won the Queens of Miss Columbia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her the title of the First Princess was that she was not able to answer the question, "What book characterizes you and why? " by Martin Murilla Gomez of the Literature Society, let's read it.
She said to the person who asked:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I certainly think that the book that characterizes my childhood - "The Little Prince" - is a pretty deep book.
Today, I read "Crime and Punishment," a masterpiece of world literature that we all should read, and I am now reading the book of Irina Nemirovskaya, a Russian author, a wonderful book called "The Fire of Blood."
The answer, which the jury didn't like because of the term "cultivation" and, secondly, because he didn't specifically explain how each of the quoted books described it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said she was quiet and content with the result: "the universe is wise, what's going to happen."
And all of you, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses put forward, Valle was burned with favoritism.
A reporter from Bogotá suggested that, as she was preferred, was ovated, and she was a candidate who won all the pre-finished awards (Oster's culinary competition, an eye vote for the best national suit, and Queen Mother), "which stirred the jealousy of the other candidates, caused the Queen's stress, and as a result, she was not gleaming on the stage."
And this was observed during her first appearance in a bathing suit on Hilton Beach and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was clear that she lacked the strength and energy that the representatives of Magdalena and the Atlantic had shown.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter of the program "As Home" on RCN, said that the fact that Milena was called a princess means "that a candidate who wins more rewards during the competition will not become a queen."
In addition, the representative of Valle had recently avoided the press, and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle failed in an attempt to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is, in the end, the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That's why, two days before the choice, Lucy Doty, a member of the International Jury, said that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Columbia, we have to look not only at the appearance, but also focus on the public mind, before they take part in the contest, they have to be involved in the projects," she said.
There is also a suggestion that the representative of Valle sinned by a defect on her buttocks and fibrosis, which was seen on her belly, but this is debatable, as the jury highlighted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good food, and responsible physical work.
Queen Jorge Hernan Orosco's counselor states that Melina didn't have the best body, which was better, "but the problem of fibrosis on her belly, which was not very visible to me, made her lose her glasses on the last day."
In the meantime, a journalist, Guido Oios, in Cromos magazine, believes that the error of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she was subjected to surgical intervention.
"Operations are good, but representative Valle doesn't know how to make them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the award, which was first awarded by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, the brutal prediction came true last night, they say it was a decoy that Raimundo gave to Melina as a compensation for her loss of the pleasure of the crown.
Whether or not, the fact is that today Melina has a year of government, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions identified directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
But she will go to history, as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the pageant in Cartagena, has had difficulty getting the crown.
That was the work of the man who identified the body of Alfonso Kano.
CSI from Cali has come to history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, CTI Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the head of FARC, Alfonso Kano, by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI forensics, Elizar Gonzalez, a man from Puerto Tehad, who spent 21 years in the field of judicial investigation, was in the queue this week.
At the start of his career, Gonzalez worked in the towns of Choco, where he often had to go through the jungle for more than five days to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and, after completing the course, he became a specialist in the field of forensics, where he studied the friction of his skin, i.e. palms and stems.
In the week of Elizar's operation to identify a man known as Alfonso Kano, he was told to take his clothes for no more than three days.
Something great was coming.
On Friday night, he arrived on a helicopter from Cauca to Palmira.
He knew he was gonna need to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten prints of Guillermo Leon Saens (his real name).
However, when he arrived with a research team at the place where the body was located, he did not recognize it in the image; it was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a local farmer, no glasses, and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Using magnifying glass, ink, scapula, and lantern, Elizar compared the body's fingerprints to those on the picture.
His eyes did not fail: it was Alfonso Cano.
The same night, the Puerto Tehad representative was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinson, that it was the head of the FARC
Search for Fingerprints
For a fingerprinter at Sijin from Kali, a confession from President Juan Manuel Santos, Elizar Gonzalez at a press conference on the operation against Cano, is of particular importance.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopie is a solid science, not a mistake, it can play a key role in solving crimes.
In addition to the identification of the bodies, the Dactyloscopies are involved in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder, and identify the detainees.
At the time of their arrest, many criminals have false or undocumented IDs.
We're taking their prints and we're looking for them in the database.
The researcher said that in the event of the theft, he had to take a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place the thief was clinging to a safe full of jewels and money.
"It's hard to work with the walls because they're not easy to take prints off, but in this case we can take a picture of the whole hand and I.D. the perpetrator who was involved in a number of thefts," he states.
Fingerprints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder-related cases.
A dead man with liquor bottles around him was recently found.
In the course of the investigation, it was found that a relative might have been suspected of committing the crime and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although it doesn't guarantee he was a murderer, it proves he was at the scene of the murder.
The CTI fingerprinting expert explained that a chemical or physical reagent is applied to the prints.
When they appear, a spade or tape is used to remove them.
The prints are then sent to Asif, a criminal database, or entered in the register.
"The problem is we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said CTI expert.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the CSI TV program.
Just as not all the gold that glitters, not everything you touch leaves prints on it.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
"Earnest People" defy the New York City authorities.
Hundreds of protesters camped in front of Zuccotti Square.
Some protesters heard the court order to break up a demonstration from the square and went to the park next door.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday, when they tried to infiltrate again, under the protection of a court order, Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to take over another Grand Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters dug up at Zukotti Square, where they wanted to go, thanks to a court order that allowed the "frequent people" to set up a camp on the plaza, while the other part of the movement responded to the break-up by seizing a park in the north of the city, where further arrests were carried out.
"Our idea is that, since the court won't let us set up a camp in the square, we'll set up a camp somewhere else, and we'll continue the court struggle to get back to Zukotti and through peaceful sit-in strikes and demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a member of the "Take Wall Street" movement.
Bray explained that the response of the “frequent people” to the evacuation of the tent city, ordered personally by the mayor of New York City, Michael Blumberg, was brought to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation from the square and allowing the protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the “frequent people” began to take over a new park, located at the confluence of the Central Street and Sixth Avenue, near the Holland Tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, and the Trinitarian parish.
For at least an hour, they could take the place, but then the police arrived and began to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not tell the exact number, but he told Efe he saw a number of journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization asserts that several hundred people were standing with tents in the place where a delegation of religious leaders went to show support to the members of the movement, trying to mediate with the police.
In the meantime, Zukotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed pending a trial scheduled for this Tuesday, which will address the legitimacy of this morning ' s protesters.
Some of the protesters on their way there carried and distributed copies of the court order at the same time, and even provided copies to the police who guarded the area, leading to “some small clashes”, said Bray, who stated that some police officers had beaten the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Occupy Wall Street movement and from coercing “laws that have been issued since the beginning of the seizure or from barring protesters from re-entering the park with shops and other property used earlier”.
Mayor Blumberg told reporters that due to this court order, the city had suspended the public space, and the protesters had been informed of it, but local laws prevented them from re-opening tent shops and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zukotti Square at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out, and the decision was made because the protesters “were in violation of the law”.
Bloemberg said that he ordered the area to be cleaned, as it became "a place where people didn't come to protest, but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm other people" because "some businesses have been threatened" and the neighbors feared "for the deterioration of the quality of life."
The evacuation that took place this morning was repulsive and shows that, deep down, Bloomberg has a greater interest in the financial interests of American workers,” added a representative of a movement who denounces the mayor for “discretion of freedom of speech.
Those responsible for the Wall Street Harvesting also indicated that they intended to organize “Grundy Actions” on Thursday, in cooperation with social organizations and trade unions, in order to recall the last two months of the protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show.
Together with Michael Bouble and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on the TV program "The Christmas of Russell Peters" on 1 December.
Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "The Big Repair", a rescuer in Malibu Saviors, a Bunny in Playboy, the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee, and now an actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show on Canadian TV.
The private TV CTV has announced today that Anderson, along with a ballad cronner, Michael Bublé, and other prominent Canadians, will be on "The Christmas of Russell Peters" on December 1, as a very special Mary.
CTV today introduced images of a TV show in which Anderson, also known for the Internet-wide home-grown pornographic video, appears with her then husband, the drummer of the band "Mötley Crue" by Tommy Lee, dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll in her cradle picture of Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who has recently played as host of "My brutal torpedo of truth" by Charlie Sheena, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a Canadian singer named Bublé, who was married in Buenos Aires at the end of March to the Argentine model, Louisiana Lopilato, and who also knows how to deal with scandals.
Buble recently called "the bitch" to American Kim Kardashian at one of her New York concerts.
Japan, resurrected from the earthquake
GDP rose by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and put an end to the fall that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed and is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that has led to a nuclear crisis, a terrible catastrophe carried over by the country of the rising sun since the Second World War.
The Tokyo Government’s first estimate is that the material loss was US$ 300,000 million, a blow that, despite the dire world situation, seems to be going on.
After three consecutive falling quarters, data on gross domestic product from July to September certainly helped to turn the page: GDP rose by 1.5 per cent over the previous quarter and by 6 per cent in annual terms.
Registered in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year is starting in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth from January to March 2010.
Renaissance may be due in part to the re-emergence of the purchase of machinery for the reconstruction of areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami that followed.
In fact, companies have increased their investment by 1.1 per cent, as opposed to a 0.9 per cent drop in capital spending from January to March, the first fall after six months of continuous growth.
But the real break in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse, which calls for the use of the crisis to strengthen - or restructure - the infrastructure, using gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has been awakened, thanks mainly to the growth of household consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japan ' s GDP.
This figure has increased by 1 per cent as a result of an increase in the cost of cars, travel and rest.
The yen’s Mark
Tokyo provided the domestic market, when the yen, the Japanese currency, became one of the “currency havens” chosen by the investors who wanted to get rid of the euro-zone debt crisis and negative US forecasts, a privilege that presses, like stone, on the accounts of exporters.
With a stronger currency, the products are expensive abroad, which is a major blow to a country whose economic policy is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sonia, for example, blames the yen for their low levels from July to September.
As long as the markets continue to be under siege by the EU peripheral countries, the Government of Esihiko Noda does not lower its vigilance.
We must be mindful of the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flooding in Thailand and the steep rise in the value of the yen, as stated yesterday by the Minister of Economic Policy, Motohis Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that most of the participating countries had shown clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
An indicator that predicts the breaks in the world economy has shown that major forces are slowing down.
It then fell by four tenths to 100.4 points, up from 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below an average of 100 points after it fell eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athenes again give cause for doubt
Papadimos said the adjustment would be approved, but the Conservatives wouldn't sign any written commitments.
With peripheral risk and uncertainty in parks, Greece is still wandering through the maze, leading to an end to the big European debt crisis.
The sense that the “consensus” of the new transitional government of Ellad is being imposed on the demand of Brussels, rather than on the true conviction of the political forces, is beginning to be supported by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reform, and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment might not be sufficient to implement it, the leader of the Conservative New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, said that he would not support the new austerity measures in any way and reiterated his demand for the new elections to be held on 19 February.
The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, said Papadimos yesterday, opening a parliamentary debate that will result tomorrow in a vote of confidence in the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform of the Public Service Disciplinary Code and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
But the message of Samaras does not make his position clear: "We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we promise nothing."
The leader of the conservatives has done one step more in his sentiments about the EU and the IMF, the organizations that should defrost the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and he has explained that he will not give his approval to any letter of consent to the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still irritating by the effect of the Papandrew-style referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demands are clear: it will not resume assistance unless the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties sign a “written agreement without any ambiguities and as soon as possible”.
A representative of the Ministry of Economics, Amadeu Altafay, said that the troika inspectors could “return very soon” to Athens to discuss with the new government, “what must be done to pay the sixth tranche” of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been set.
The Greek tube has enough string for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: "These are the tools of progress and hope."
The Queen emphasized the “main” place of Spain in respect of this type of finance.
Spain “has a prominent place in the world in the area of microfinance”.
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that over the last two decades the country has become the second-largest contributor to the instruments of cooperation, whose “essentiality”, she said, is that it is “a tool of social progress, justice and hope for the best future for all of humanity, based on faith in people.
The Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the belief that there is no doubt that such action is “perfectly necessary” to meet the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and “in particular with a view to halving the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the level at which the “fuck of poverty” is recorded.
Spain is still working to expand the network of recipients all over the world and is taking on this task with all “responsibility”, says Dona Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will “ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for the women, the major recipients of these loans.
There are "many achievements" and "many challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit has become not only a forum for debate, but also a platform that promotes “two main goals”.
Her Majesty has thus explained that she hopes that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families will benefit from these financial services and that one hundred million of these households will get out of the poverty in which they are immersed.
The impulse for the creation of a system of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world “was on the path begun years ago” by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Mrs. Sofia as a “act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of this instrument as "the stunning idealist in the global fight against poverty," whose work has been known for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to look at his lending policy on the ground.
A year later, the first World Summit in Washington, D.C., and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “everywhere I have seen continuous development,” Her Majesty, whose connection to this project made her last night the title of the head of the family, which was gathered in Valladolid by a“poor banker”.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her statement, calling on the participants to participate in the discussion and to find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Trinidad Jimenez, Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that solidarity was an “ethical imperative” for every democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, as it was a “continuing commitment”.
Jimenez concluded that microcredit was a “serious and solid policy to eradicate poverty” and that “more than ever” developed-country Governments should work in solidarity and not be allowed to fall prey to spending.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, commended the “success” in giving the “confidence” to the people who have all the doors closed, and the Mayor of Valladolide, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, greeted everyone in the city who “opens his door in a spirit of solidarity”.
The CDU proposes to elect the Chairman of the European Commission by universal vote.
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CPU) on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without major problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the program, but it was in the fall itself, in particular to satisfy the activists who believe that government policy is far from as strict as it should be today with regard to Greece, and perhaps tomorrow with respect to Italy....
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, tabled by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The ovations, which lasted for a few minutes, deserved by their statements by Angel Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schoible, the eurofile and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main message of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is the slogan: the right answer to the crisis is “not less than Europe, but more than Europe”.
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This may mean a change in the Lisbon Treaty, making it possible to strengthen European Union control over eurozone financial policies, but it may also affect the European Commission’s election by universal vote to “make Europe a face”.
In any event, this is one of the proposals for a draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which is clearly Wolfgang Schöble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the 27 countries will quickly agree to this decision; Britain is opposed to it, and HDZ leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also opposed to it.
But the soil is ready.
In the same way, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each EU member country in the European Central Bank, according to the size of the economy of each of them, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
In an effort to calm the situation in her party, the Chancellor has increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kole, but she has not sought to influence the Congress at the expense of “small” European countries or countries in distress, who like to criticize the “higher” Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe focused on the importance of “German-French friendship”, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just bypass.
Remembering that two centuries ago Leipzig was the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, this was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What's a scam with a sick card?
After the cash benefits, the UMP and the government launched an attack on the hospital beds.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will come to Bordeaux to attend the Family Benefit Fund and give a speech on the subject, which has been on the rise since 2007, on the fight against social benefit fraud.
And to help this attack, which has emerged from the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also part of the right-wing presidential re-election campaign, most want to focus on sick leave.
In the first place, with a view to saving the budget, the Government intends to impose on private company employees the fourth day of unpaid leave before the start of the payment of the benefit.
Evidently, without the special consent of the employer, the sick worker will lose his or her wage in four days at a minimum of 15 per cent of his or her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to give rise to a storm of anger, but that, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euro.
And it will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, to impose one day on public servants without a sickness benefit (the public service has so far not had to wait for the payment of the benefit, as opposed to a three-day waiting period for private-sector employees).
Now that these issues are under discussion, most also re-emerging the subject of fraud, with a view to the abuse of sick leave.
Control will become more strict, and in addition, if you get caught, you'll have to return all the illegal payments you've received," warned Xavier Bertrand on RTL on Saturday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the application has been somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of sick leave.
Indeed, since 2002, they have been subject to constant control and political attacks, which bear fruit.
The people in France are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's look at the country figures first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million Euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, the daily cost of compensation in 2008 of Euro11.3 million was 5 per cent of the total cost of health care.
Of this amount, 46 per cent related to maternity leave and work-related accidents and 54 per cent to sickness benefits, which amounted to Euro6.2 million.
And so it was 2.5 per cent of the health-related cost.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to an Alma Consulting Group study.
The arithmetical average, which conceals some of the abnormalities; another study, published in 2007 by the Monster.com Career Management Web site, found that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they didn't take a day of sick leave.
Another study, this time on health insurance, states that in 2010, 37 per cent of the hospital population lasted less than 8 days, 15 per cent from 15 days to 1 month, 15 per cent from 1 to 3 months, and 11 per cent from 11 per cent were longer.
If these figures are compared to those of European neighbours, it can be seen that French workers are no more likely to take the sick than any other country.
A long-term study by two CNRS researchers in 2010 found that between 1994 and 2001, the total unemployment rate in France (for health reasons or not) ranged from 10 per cent to 11 per cent, compared to 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16 to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The rate of fraud associated with sick leave is very low compared to grey employment.
As for the level of fraud, it is very low.
The tightening of the law since 2002 has led to a systematic examination of the hospital for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term reports were “unjustified” or too long, which was 37,050.
In the case of systematic check-ups, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were “inadmissible or unsubstantiated”, which is 132,000.
Overall, 169,000 cases were “unjustified” for a number of millions of employees who received sick leave.
Figures that show very few cases in comparison to, for example, the grey ones in employment.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on the subject, they amount to between Euro9 million and Euro15,000 million in uncollected revenue per year, which is more than the total cost of daily compensation, and is therefore infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos announced this to Parliament, adding that the 100 days allocated to his coalition Government was not enough to carry out this task.
“In order to achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme,” said the head of Government, who made his first public statement, opening the debate on the vote of trust in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October should be the “primary task” of the new Government, as the country's presence in the eurozone was “in the process of being at stake”, he added.
Papadimos therefore forecasts a reduction in the country's budget deficit to “about 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right-wings reject the new Government's actions
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support further austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the deputies of his party New Democracy.
He agreed with the goals of reducing deficits and debt and fighting waste, but also with his rejection of any policy that was hindering the recovery of the economy.
Ollie Renu, the European commissioner in charge of the economy and finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary credit of 8,000 million euro without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
There is a need to legalize euthanasia and suicide with extraneous help, claims the committee of experts.
The Canadian is denied death, as stated in a report from the Royal Society of Canada.
With regard to palliative medicine, the committee states that the Government, health-care institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, excluding cancer.
Canadese is denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die, and to take steps in this direction.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from a wide range of fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the Criminal Code to allow for extraneous suicide and euthanasia, where this choice is imposed by the circumstances, and the patient may be considered competent to make such a decision.
For starters, the experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Office, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries.
While Canada is ranked 10, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death”.
Because of medicinalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6 per cent of them end up in a hospital.
The highest rate in the country is in Québec, where 86 per cent of the deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and extraneous suicide, the report concludes that it is contrary to the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code with respect to euthanasia and extraneous suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization entails abuse of use, i.e. euthanasia or extraneous suicide against people who cannot or do not want to make such a decision.
On the contrary, at a teleconferencing session, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed most of the cases in countries where euthanasia and extraneous suicide had not been legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Suicide with extraneous help is practised in Canada, where it is apparently illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
Remember, 85 per cent of Canadians are in favor of euthanasia, because, according to an Angus Reid survey in 2010, they believe that this will help people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not signal that the lives of the elderly or the disabled are of less value.
In the case of people who had been suicidal, 41 per cent of the respondents believed that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the sick, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Penal Code should establish that legal termination of medical care is not an offence.
The Committee of Experts also requires health professionals to be trained in a spirit of respect for the abandonment of health care at the end of a life without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee called on the Government, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, not just in the case of cancer.
Finally, with regard to a palliative or terminal session already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requires that it be used when it is not used to collide physical pain, such as euthanasia, and subject to the same limitations.
Comments by other experts
Some health-related legal experts have already commented on the report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a health law expert, described the “extreme” position of the experts who had signed the report as not limiting the use of euthanasia to death, among other things.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years of age can ask for suicidal help, says metre Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seem to place the independence of the individual above all other values that form the social fabric of society.
He said, "There are warning signs and bans in society."
The health law expert, Margaret Somerville, also expresses “a categorical disagreement with the report's findings, which she called a “manifest for euthanasia”.
Margaret Somerville, who herself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, inter alia, the report on abuses in some countries where euthanasia and extraneous suicide have been legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to give up power
Damaskus denounces "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly in isolation
Bashar Assad's supporters held a demonstration yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, there was a rise in diplomatic pressure on Syria, Bashar Assad, who, with Russia's support, resisted it and denounced a “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria ' s membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union tightened the sanctions against Damascus, and the neighbours of Syria, Turkey and Jordan, advocated the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar Assad to give up power in Syria, where some forty more civilians and members of the regime ' s armed forces were killed.
"Had Bashar been a dear country, he should have resigned, but he also had to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life," said the King of Jordan, next to Syria, in an interview with BBC.
In turn, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglu, expressed his regret that Turkey ' s mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot meet their aspirations will lose power, he said, in hindsight on Syria, a neighbouring country to which Turkey is on an increasingly hard track.
For its part, the United States welcomes the “extension of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly strict course in dealing with repression in Syria, Mark Toner, a representative of the Department of State.
Since then, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime ' s armed forces have been killed in the Dar ' a area of southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
The other two people died in an exchange of fire and heavy machine-gun fire in Jobar in Homs besieged city, according to this ONG.
During a press conference, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Muallem, stated that the country was nearing the end of the crisis.
In addition, he reacted sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
"Syria will not be broken, he added, "assuring that this plot against Syria would fail."
After its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers to be deployed to the country.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Alain Juppe, also expressed his support for the dispatch of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of a regime he said had fallen into a paranoia.
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the 2 November crisis recovery plan, which includes the withdrawal of the armed forces from fighting towns and the release of the arrested protesters.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, yesterday called the League of Arab States' decision “unreasonable”, while China called on Syria to implement a plan to emerge from the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty takes time from the markets and the Italian victims.
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monty, has asked for a little time from the markets to form a team and implement a program that will require “victims” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi’s rule.
The former European commissioner was in a discussion with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet, composed of technocrats who are not part of Parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of a multi-victim program, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups that are participating in the discussions after a meeting with a candidate for the position of prime minister.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he would have waited to see if Mario Monty would have asked the Parliament to vote on trust by Friday to make sure that the new government has enough support.
The meeting will end with the presentation by Mr. Monty of a restricted list of a dozen or so ministers to head of the country, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on the nervousness of stock exchanges and bond holders yesterday, asking for time.
With “democracy, it takes time to prepare the government and the program, he stressed, adding that he was convinced that the markets would be patient and understanding.
His appointment as president was first approved by the markets, but the concern rekindled, in particular after the sudden fall of industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister was to form a team, including, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he also wanted to include “policies”.
The new Government would be in place until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Jianfranco Fini, the new Government will receive a vote of confidence in the Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty assured that, by joining the post, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would again become an important actor in Europe.
The representative of European Commissioner Ollie Ren stressed that “despite the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not meet the 2013 budget, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, required, inter alia, new and strict measures.
The Italian "boss bosses" Emma Marchegalya, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the parameters of a deficit."
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence as the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented the “mystery of the era” for Italy after 17 years of Berlusconism, a “professor” symbolizing “the challenge of seriousness” and“ the other Italy”, according to the authors of the headlines.
The great unknown is the durability of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid quick elections, as by April 2012, Italy was to make payments in the amount of Euro200,000 on public debt.
A Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danylenko helped Iran to develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, and on Monday, an American agency specializing in the field of nuclear danger was confirmed.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISISS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other UN agency documents to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern about the “possible military dimension” of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based in large part on IAEA documents, Mr. Danielko was born in 1934, working for 30 years, “beginning in the 1960s, at the Soviet Military Nuclear Center in Chelyabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds with the methods of explosion”.
He left the centre in 1989 or 1991 to set up a company that produces “nano-almaz” in Kyiv.
His company ' s financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia.
In its report, the IAEA mentions “the clear signs that Iran's development of the nuclear detonator system has “promoted the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technology well, but who also told the Agency that he was working most of his career on this technology as part of his home country's military nuclear programme”.
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes rose by almost 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence declined slightly or did not change over the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49 per cent, as compared with a 13 per cent increase in the number of cases of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in the number of attacks on Jews, and a 14 per cent increase in the number of religiously motivated crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, rose very little to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
After the fall in 2009, it is a matter of concern that the number of such crimes is on the rise again, as highlighted by Human Rights First, “the increase in the incidence of violence against Muslims is particularly significant”, adds the organization in the official report.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered serious human rights violations”, added one of the leaders of the organization, Paul Lejandre.
“The American Government can and must do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, in the belief that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes.”
Hate crimes in federal law are the legacy of a period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and sexual orientation today.
Twitter changes its platform and grows like Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter microblog site made changes to the presentation of its platform, which will enable its users to see, inter alia, the activity of the people they follow, making it look like Facebook.
The new "activity" tab and the other "name" make it possible to follow more easily and directly the activities of other Twitters, Internet users whose messages ("twits") you follow, and those who track yours.
This makes it possible to learn if they publish messages, if they sign new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
The new Twitter formula was tested "at a low percentage of the users in August" before it was made available on a web-wide basis on Monday, and announced to AFP that Carolyn Penner would be a Twitter press secret.
Twitter, which has been known for a long time as intuitively rather incomprehensible, and as using rather vague terms (RT to cross someone else's message, #followfriday for the recommendation to track other users), is mostly enjoying experienced users, and it opens up to a wider audience, representing the users more closely to the popular social networks of Facebook and Google+.
On the Internet, users have been talking about this innovation via Twitter online.
"It's pointless, obsessive, and it's too much like Facebook."
Functional activity will help me to better track certain features of my Twitter stream, written by @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Incorporation of the “Golden Rule” Budget in the Constitution
The leadership of a large coalition of social-democrats and Christian-democrats in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a budget “gold rule” in the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus to avoid a possible downgrading of Austria's public credit rating agencies (triple A).
The Chancellor of the Social Democracy, Werner Faimann, personally announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers meeting, with an Austrian public debt of 74.6 per cent, much higher than the top 60 per cent limit set by the Maastricht Treaty, but lower than the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria’s capacity to pay had fallen by one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest by 3,000 million Euros more every year, the Vice-Chancellor’s argument and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Christian Democrats, Michael Spindegger.
Austria is thus meeting the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; the heads of State and Government have demanded a reduction in fiscal deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through the constitution or an equivalent law.
The order adopted by the Austrian Government is like a “German model”, as Germany was the first European country to adopt the “Regulation”.
Until 2017, the State ' s structural deficit should be reduced by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, while from 2017, the federal State ' s structural deficit should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP in any year, and the land, like the communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The aim is to make public debt fall below 60% of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Esihiko Noda
Threatens new intervention on the currency market
Japan’s prime minister, Jeshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would take new intervention on the foreign exchange market if the yen’s value continued to grow.
We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we consider the exchange rate of the yen to be overstretched, Mr. Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to an almost historical mark, which prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which has set a new record of power since 1945.
But ever since, the yen has been growing, driven by the purchases of investors, who view it as a “refugee” in these worrisome times of global economic collapse and the European debt crisis.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the 105 yen symbolical bar, close to the level that led to the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yen, and the euro was over 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency is damaging to Japan’s export, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese firms from abroad when converting into a national currency.
Japan is fighting to rebuild itself after the 11 March earthquake and tsunami, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), underlined Mr. Noda, who fears that the yen's growth will kill the fragile foetus of reconstruction.
The third largest economic Power in the world resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent as compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in the year, thanks to an increase in exports and the consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect the “fundamental economic performance of Japan. ”
Minister of Finance Jun Adzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day session of its Money Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Manager of Hirohide Yamaguchi has warned that the Bank of Japan has already taken “the right steps” to make it clear that no further mitigation should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting in late October, the issuing organization increased the purchase of treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (47 million euro), raising to 55,000 million yen (519 million euro) the ceiling of the amounts it spends on the purchase of various financial instruments to saturate the stock market.
Eurozone
The stakes are rising, stock exchanges are fluctuating
The risk of a debt crisis is eroding European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and the improved growth in France and Germany, the rates in fragile countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the eurozone’s stability, European exchanges left on Tuesday, 15 November, a bit further to the negative zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4% and finished the bid at 3,064 points.
The DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, and London fell by 0.1%.
In view of the new difficulties in the payment of credit to eurozone countries in difficult circumstances, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
"Disturbed investors are just too concerned about the risk of contamination," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker of IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Exchange closed down with a fall of 0.7 per cent under the weight of new market members ' doubts about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused on Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in a narrow-changing corridor until the investors can prove that the situation has stabilized,” states Mitsushige Akino, the manager of the Ichioshi Investment Management Foundation.
This return of concern for the future of the eurozone is a single currency that continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was $1,3570, falling by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it fell after the Congress of Chancellor Angela Merkel HDZ on Monday, at which a resolution was adopted, including the possibility for a country in a difficult situation to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are well above 6%
Loan rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
On Tuesday morning, Italian 10-year-old bonds made a return of 6.85 per cent, and Spanish bonds with the same maturity rate of 6.2 per cent.
These difficulties with interest rates in the South, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of the participants.
Mario Monty, head of the future of the Italian government, has asked for time from the exchange to restore the situation in Italy, which is at risk of being paralyzed under the weight of his debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papadimos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October will be the “primary task” of his Government.
Spain was hit by markets before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spike between interest rates for Germany and Spain’s 10-year debt peaked at a new historical peak.
Waiting for eurozone growth
France recorded a growth rate of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3 per cent, thanks to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, re-evaluated the second quarter with a drop of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first assessment for the entire eurozone is expected at 11:00 a.m., the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas
If there is a theme on which no decision can be made after a short discussion or by emotion, it is an energy policy.
Accessibility and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
This is a healthy trend that election meetings become a reason to think about the share and place of nuclear power.
The argument will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the options have been explored.
France must base its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
Now, we have 7,000 million people on the planet, and demographic development will result in a doubling of the demand for electricity by 2050, unless a large part of the world ' s population is deprived of vital elements.
Over the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing fossil resource gap in order to continue the generation of electricity on a continuous basis, without forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to address the climate imbalance, a theme that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision dependent on the need to find a source to replace nuclear power, or of Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, are just a few who are moving ahead with their projects.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add one plant to its kit by restarting the construction of the station, which was interrupted after the Tri-Mile Island accident.
Although the model of Germany based on renewable energy is sometimes cited as an example, the fact is not in line with this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, exacerbated by the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, and a rise in CO2 emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be visible.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European Turbine Champion, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; so that CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher, respectively, than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the permanence of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than the French households.
Since in a globalized economy, the price of energy is a key to competitiveness and to the maintenance of industrial equipment on national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear power will result in a major increase in the cost of electricity, which will make the beautiful statements about our country ' s new industrialization and the protection of purchasing power illusory.
The price that most French refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this kind of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 intermediates.
Highly export-oriented, it attracts an entire pool of specialized international small and medium-sized enterprises, and it generates many jobs that cannot be moved to another sector.
If France decided to give up nuclear energy, it would have to donate a lot of these enterprises and lose 6,000 million Euros a year from the French export of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electric engineer will order an EPR calculated to work for sixty years if the manufacturer is to close down?
To solve the energy equation, it must be recognized that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy.
Areva's development of low-carbon solutions, nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy to maintain the highest level of safety is certainly a vital issue.
In France, we have a security agency that has uncompromising and transparent control of existing energy centres, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is well-recognized, are full of the same security obsession.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mile Island, occurred under normal conditions of exploitation, but without any human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the reactor device and the unforgivable human error led to a tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural catastrophes of an unprecedented force that led to the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from the accident, as it has learned from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and the co-operation between the security authorities, the operators and the French and German designers, EPR, is a project to counter such phenomena.
Since it is viewed by all energy experts who want to build a reactor, halting it in Flamanville will be an excellent gift to Areva and EDF competitors, making the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is also necessary to find the best mix of energy for our country, but it would be irresponsibly to allow emotion, dogma and preconceived maneuvers to triumph over a dispute that is so important to our country ' s economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or a good thing for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized on various fronts - the overloading of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of numbers and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a “human rights State”.
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which was in the news when the Minister of the Interior (Liberation of 23 May) stated that France “does not need foreign talents, stoners, and waiters.
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is much agreement between the right and left on this issue.
On the right hand side, Jacques Chirac, who stated in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed people will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers,” and on the left hand side, Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France “can't accept the poor from all over the world”.
Variances in the level of generosity only
In 2005, fear of entry into the country by a Polish plumber was felt by both the left and the right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden on the French economy and on French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity they allow to show to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande limited himself to banalism, saying that “joint work will solve our problem of immigration”.
This view of immigration as a burden and a problem can have an elective advantage, but it is very expensive.
As we are reminded by economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book that summed up the latest data on immigration (Specific People: How Migration Made Our World and Determines Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University, 352 s.), there is a wide consensus among experts on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restriction of immigration has led to a weakening of growth and a lowering of employment.
Fears of the influence of immigrants are based on the notion that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled workers, by causing lower wages.
But experience has shown that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than they are replacing the local labour force with jobs for which there is a lack of local labour.
Immigrants who are unskilled work in sectors that do not attract local labour, and the most qualified work in dynamic sectors where training is not related to job offers.
A positive effect on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between locals and immigrants has a positive effect on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase in the migration flow results in an 0.6-0.9 per cent increase in real long-term wages.
And this is without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring in is creating new ideas and economic growth (of the American Nobel laureates, a high proportion of naturalized immigrants, while Google, Intel, Paypal, and Yahoo are all found by immigrants).
Migrants also make net gains in social security systems, with an average of 1 per cent of the total European budgets.
The World Labour Organization, for example, in Germany, when an immigrant arrives at the age of 30, estimates that an average of 150,000 Euros will make a net return to the State budget.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the start of his mandate, was about to get his asses in the missing points of growth.
Those teeth, which were used to frighten immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, left to think about European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition, but also a fragile one.
The European continent must remember that, by inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century, it experienced the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulaga, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, and the colonels in Greece.
Some believed that for democracy to triumph over its enemies, it was enough to vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon's day, "The Little" has been known to be from the surface of the mind.
A universal vote, though a prerequisite for democracy, is not a sufficient condition for it, and can even become an instrument of repression, as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vásro once said.
No, democracy requires much more - public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, and justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is primarily a political and a democracy crisis.
In this respect, the palinodium of a true-loving Greek referendum will have a double debugging effect, demonstrating both the need for a major change in policy and a disheartening sense of its impossibility and incoherence.
This duality needs to be understood to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now moved and, in the view of many, the Republican soldiers are now targeting the wrong way.
We will not win anything by requiring a series of national referenda organized as needed and in a chaotic order.
"Cart Blanche" for an absolute European monarch or a leap with his legs tied to the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we are not dreaming of a guillotine blade, but of a common, clear and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and we don't know how many more are to be listed, because there is only one crisis: the crisis in Europe.
All of Europe is under the dictation of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and a lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is completely degraded on the international scene.
Many are concerned about the transfer of European sovereignty, but all of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The management of the European project under national sovereignty is urgently needed.
Because it is only by working together that Europeans can reduce the debt burden of everyone, free themselves from the markets, and prepare for the future by investing in it.
A solution to the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, without bringing us to a catastrophe.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the socialists and Jacques Delore, everyone now demands a European economic government.
Let's just say so.
But to imagine it without a stronger economic, political, and democratic integration that has come to life is another madness and a new dead end.
We must begin a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to “create” the Republicans.
A revolution of interest would not be enough.
This lesson is still valid.
We must build a united Europe at the economic level.
This can be done only by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, true national European sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
Unconnected chip-cards are spreading more and more.
The world card show opens on Tuesday in Wilpenta, Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM phones), over 6 million units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important sector of unconnected technology is the sector that can pay for public transport or shopping by simply drawing a map over the reader.
This year, the world will sell 460 million unattended chips, up from 320 million a year ago!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected at 580 million units) to almost 10 per cent of the world market for chip-cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind Asia and the Pacific, is now moving forward in the area of unattended payments.
Some 26 million Visa Bank Cards are already equipped with this function, and are used by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting from a more modest position: 400,000 Visa unattended charts are in circulation.
But big shops are getting faster.
This year Carrefore released 2.5 million unconnected Pass MasterCards.
To move at a higher rate, banks need to equip their clients.
"The two big organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute bank cards to their clients for unattended use in the future," said Gerard Nebuy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments with a mobile phone.
But this is just the first step in the future of the means of payment, that is, a mobile phone.
So far, there are only a handful of NFCs (Communication of the Nearfield) that are needed to carry out such transactions.
"They have been postponed.
"But they have to really break up next year."
"We're counting on the global sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012, "by Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced an experiment from December to June of next year in Qana.
The iPhone facilities of some 200 clients and staff members will be provided with covers that provide non-contact payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasburg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also announced yesterday that he was preparing to launch a proposal to enable his clients to pay via mobile phones.
The terrorist front is spreading from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links of the Islamic Maghreb to the Boko Haram sect.
The long-awaited links between the al-Qa`idah terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that the Algerians were now confident.
“The help that the two organizations use, and the reports of the secret services show that they are active in cooperation,” he explained, without entering into detail.
Paris seems to have come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the abduction of two French men in Niger in January revealed two links.
Kidnapping at a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Léokur and Vincent Delori, apparently the following day, along with a number of the kidnappers, were killed during an operation by the French Special Forces.
Among the fragments left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found a number of SIM-cards belonging to the terrorists.
The axis of terror
An analysis of the phones revealed a number of interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one indicates a Nigerian who lived for a long time in Maidiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram cradle, and one who is said to be close to Aqmi and a sect.
"This is a step forward, but no doubt we have to wait for more solid evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"For many years, it has been known that the cult has been receiving external financial and intellectual support and that it has become more and more active," said Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of suicides and the increasingly complex type of explosive device used by Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, D.C., is now putting pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the problems Boko Haram is posing.
The fact is, the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of enlightened people of no interest.
Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri at the mosque, school and imam fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "Western education is sin" - preaches the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It is politicized and requires strict observance of the sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against the wicked central government.
It's focused on churches, bars, and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
The Abuji response, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left behind 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the cult is radicalized and will go beyond its northern suburbs.
Last Christmas, she took responsibility for an action that killed 80 people in Joss, and then for another one in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boko Haram launched the first suicide attack on a strengthened police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a matter of concern to all security experts.
Now that Aqmi has been strengthened in Mali and Niger, and Somalis from al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with Presidents Goodluck, Jonathan Alain Juppe warned Boko Haram of the danger and offered to share all the information available.
The world, as the Republican presidential candidates see it
With regard to China, Iran, and Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, and Rick Perry are competing in simplicity and incompetence.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, lead a complex world with simple, or, more precisely, simplistic, ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates, the voters could believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry, and others have been a multiplicity of loud, but undetailed, foreign policy statements, which have traditionally been a strong part of the Republicans.
The slogans concerning China, Iran and Israel are often combined.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of being nominated by the Good Party's Old Party, threatened to file a complaint with the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of “manipulating his currency is a sensitive theme for America, irritated by the migration of its entire industries to Asia.
Worse, if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Obama’s ambassador to China, and the only candidate who has an understanding of complex foreign policy, has not been able to resist a position that is embracing emotion.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stays at the bottom of the ratings, has not been heard.
Reagan style.
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if the sanctions could not stop its nuclear program.
"If I'm selected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to step up his military assistance to Israel, blaming Obama for failing to keep his promises to that partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second in the list of candidates, has shown a discouraging lack of knowledge.
He has recently called for the Chinese military threat to stand up, because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power - obviously not knowing that China has it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military attacks on Iran, says he's ready to use the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The 2009 Obama-prohibited terrorist suspects are also recommended to be tortured by Kane, Perry, and Michelle Bachman.
All of this is far from the 2008 national candidate John McCain, the heavyweight of foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amate, and that he had to lower his tone in the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of the “boys” out of Iraq, and his tricks in Libya, which gave him a reputation for a weak policy.
But the attack is not that simple.
The people view the positive balance of Obama's national security, which eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military intervention that binds it in the sand.
And, while asserting that America needs to be rebuilt economically to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
The North Flux, a new gateway for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The North Line, which links Western Europe and Russia directly to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has been launched.
It is designed to supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with pop.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between the band's performance and exquisite snacks, in the opening of the North Flux, a new gas pipeline that directly links Russia and Germany underwater.
German chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fion, and his Dutch colleague, Marta Rütte, together turned the figurative valve controlling the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
Under the new gas pipeline, 27.5 million extra cubic meters of gas will be flowing to Western Europe every year through the first 1224 km pipeline, linking the Leningrad Region to the land of Meklenburg-Mexia.
The second pipeline is to be ready at the end of 2012 with a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas equivalent to the total consumption of France.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this immense project is a win.
The project met the ferocious resistance of Poland and the Baltic States.
The Northern Flux will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany by avoiding the passage through a third country (Polish or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power, making it more difficult for them to influence Russia, threatening to block access to Western European markets.
At the most stressful moment of the Warsaw debate, it was not possible to compare the North Stream with the new “German-Soviet Pact”, insinuating an alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That means the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of its supply.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has been able to reach an understanding of a direct union between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are consuming large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are on the run.
“This gas pipeline is part of the cooperation with Russia, it's a new artery that binds us organically,” said François Fion, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating how big gas contracts are both politically and economically important.
All of this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the point of gas arrival.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipe is made of steel in concrete to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It lies on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, it was necessary to bypass the minefields left since the Second World War.
"A hundred needed to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, North Flux Press Secretary.
There was also a need to take many steps to protect fauna and flora.
Pipeline is a long metallic snake with a weight of 242 Eiffel towers, without ruptures all over it, without valves, and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project manager abandoned it, because Sweden was not thrilled that a Russian public company would live on its shores forever.
"In the event of an accident, we'll cut off the gas in less than a minute," Jens Müller claims.
So, in the event of a leak, the gas in the gas line will go out.
But this seems unlikely to be the designer of the seams, which are designed to run once every 100,000 years.
The state of the gas pipeline will be monitored by a submersible robot that pulls the ship, for external surveillance, as well as by a apparatus circulating inside the gas pipeline.
The cigar-like apparatus is injected inside a 1 metre-wide pipe and pressed forward with a gas stream.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at 3 meters per second, it provides accurate information on any deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed for 50 years without the need for the slightest repairs.
Gas circulation is based on the pressure of the gas.
It is 200 bars on departure and 100 bars on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement the project.
The leader is Gazprom, who owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent each), the Dutch Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9 per cent each).
The five companies set up a joint venture called the North Stream, which was charged with the construction and operation of a gas pipeline.
Its headquarters are in Tsugu in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company for 20 years with the possibility of an extension of the full volume of gas transport.
"Gasprom will pay for the full volume, no matter how much gas will actually be transported," states Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline was provided by 30 per cent of the shareholders and 70 per cent of the bank loans.
The total cost of the work will be Euro7.4 million for two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investment will be about 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident that they will pay off their costs, because Gazprom is taking all the risks.
The gas pipeline is moving from the Baltic Sea to Lubmin on a sandy shore, planted with coniferous trees.
The vents are four and a half meters high and form a gas outlet.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature, and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into the German gas pipelines.
From last Tuesday, the terminal gets one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million an hour, and in 2012 it will be 6 million.
Moleskine Brand Notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will bring back the taste for the letter.
He's got the aroma of adventure, hours spent after a letter in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easy to recognize on the rectangular black cover, on the rubber, on the yellow-and-white pages, as if yellowed over time.
But the notebook Moleskine, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to launch design notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's then consultant, took on the responsibility for launching a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old technique of production, the moleskin is a lacquered cotton cloth used, for example, to cover the bench.
It is claimed that this type of notebook is highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine aligned today's taste with an old and forgotten thing that was a cult for the Avenger Artists up to the 20th century," said Maria Cebregondi, who has since become a brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales rose by 25% to 12.7 million.
We are far from producing the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed Italy's borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is hard to set a profile for a typical buyer, because the notebook attracts a businessman, a student, and a man of a free profession.
Buyers of Moleskine are cosmopolitan, open-minded and well-educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks at Fnac Bookshops, shops in small city centres, and has been able to gain wide visibility.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new need for a letter, despite the advent of e-mail," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This feature of culture is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; the brand has recently organized an exhibition on the "Ground Road", where architects and artists have shown their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched the cover with a leopard picture on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Using his success and his cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified his products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags, and Brand has all sorts of support.
The success of the envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which added a new page to the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
The 15th week of work for disabled people begins today.
Despite the public philanthropy policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% as against 9% for the population as a whole.
Disappointing?
"No," states Eric Blanche, Director General Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of work for disabled people.
"Big progress has been made in 15 years."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not two, but three times that."
"But there's still a lot of work to do."
It must be said that there are still many barriers to employment for a disabled person.
Of these, more are older: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They are more of a low-level student: 80 per cent do not have a Bachelor ' s degree, and out of 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, as compared to an average of 38 per cent.
In short, all of these criteria, which make it very difficult to get back to work and which are the core of the problem,” says Christian Grapen, Director General Trempling, an association set up in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about mentality, which is changing, but too slow.
A April study by the IMS-Entreprendre, commissioned by Cité, found that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge of disability and “represented complete people in carts or mentally or mentally disabled”.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from having 6 per cent of disabled workers, as set out in the Act of 1987.
The last known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
"Today we're about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Proof: The number of “obligated” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, fell from 59,000 to 46,000 in 2007-2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which raised the tax, put a lot of pressure on the company," Pierre Blanc explains.
"But this improvement also reflects a rise in awareness, in particular in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled workers, as compared to 82 per cent of organizations with 100 to 199.
Azar: "What happiness."
Before fighting the Blues on Tuesday night (20.45 a.m.) Eden Azar and Georges Leekens did not conceal the pleasure they had from this friendly match.
We will not be able to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Azar made up.
Five months after his attacker in a match against Turkey, a Belgian trainer can only commend him.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his progress, and the fact that he's a Belgian."
"I want to go on," says the player Lille.
As for the contrast between his performance in the club and the team, it's one thing, he's justifying it.
"I'm in Lille all year long, and I'm not in Belgium."
"I have to make my glasses."
Reservated, in the run-up to this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar arrived in St. Denis to finally "greeze."
Not forgetting, however, the concept of pleasure.
He supported the Blues from the age of 7 and the 1998 and 2000 wins.
"I have always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also reinforces the special character of this match.
And especially the fact that there are Mathieu (Debushi), Johan (Cabe) and Adil (Rami) on the other side.
"Just our paths crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens was kind enough to remember "holy."
"Great" to play "the holiday match."
Pride also asserts that France “renewed to be a very high-level team” just a year after the injury in Neun.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderbolt, admired him.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, a tech sportsman will fly in the same plane as the Blues... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll find out in the next match, including this one against France."
Portugal is very confident
Portugal, Paulo Bento, is starting a retaliatory match against Bosnia on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to it, both teams seemed to lose a sense of reality.
"By the end of this 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paulo Bentu is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the Team, which has been running it since September 2010, has been classified as Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and there's a Bosnia to win.
With 0-0 on Friday in Zenica hell, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal has dominated the match for over an hour, it has not been able to achieve a cherished goal that would reassure her.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk."
But at their brightly lit de la Lus Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of the public, who should be thrilled, even though the match will be very stressful,' said the optimist but sensible Bento.
"We expect a very stressful match, but we are convinced we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50 per cent chance of getting to the Euro 2012," said Carlos Keiros' successor.
No one on Friday's match against Bosnia demands the Portuguese to win.
No one could have arranged for the Bosniacs.
"This is a good result, but there is some risk," lamented Bent.
"We're gonna play against a team with a lot of technical merit and a lot of individual merit" he added.
As was the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosniacs from the start, "no time to think."
It's a good idea to make it real this time.
