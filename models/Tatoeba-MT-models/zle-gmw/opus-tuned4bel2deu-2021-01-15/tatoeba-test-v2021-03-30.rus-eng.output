I can't explain it to you.
He's afraid of dogs.
The party was full of girls.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
How have you been able to impress Tom?
Why does he hate me?
Stop teasing him.
He's known her since high school.
Tom pretended it didn't happen.
I promised myself I'd quit smoking.
Stay here with them.
The accident almost cost him his life.
He shattered the bottle.
We're home.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I didn't say yes.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you don't get me wrong.
Why are you so mysterious?
You're just running away from life's problems.
It's snowing out.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting for you for three hours.
I failed the test.
Eat while it's hot.
He had to wait three hours.
What do you suggest to me?
Tom thinks Mary's an idiot.
I told Tom to wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you were coming, too.
Last week, I bumped into Tom in Boston.
Tom paints.
Tom didn't know Mary loved to cook.
I told Tom you're busy.
Tom was surprised to see Mary in Boston.
You want a joke?
I wanted to do more.
Tom is our best pilot.
Are you sure you know what Tom has to do?
I can't just ignore it.
She goes to school on a bike.
I'm gonna cry!
You want to drive?
I've been doing all day last night.
They're the same age.
There's a coin under the table.
It's empty.
Wash the windows.
Don't think I didn't try.
You stay here, the rest go out.
Tom risked his life to save Mary.
A caravan of fifty camels hurried in the desert.
You should be ashamed of your own ignorance.
I traded places with Tom.
Tom went to the park alone.
You're a teacher, aren't you?
I'm not gonna try to convince you.
I knew Tom wasn't gonna lose.
Tom told Mary he was thirsty.
Why are you grinning?
Tom didn't say how he was gonna get there.
Didn't I tell you I'm allergic to peanuts?
I know how old you are.
I'm not gonna show it to anyone again.
Tom won't sell his house.
I didn't want to disappoint Tom.
I'll teach you.
I have food.
He moved on to her.
I wouldn't do that.
Tom tried to suffocate Mary.
I've decided to try again.
Tom won't let you win any more.
Cosmonauts wear suits.
Algeria is buying artillery from Russia.
Shall I tell Tom what happened?
I don't have anything to give you.
Why should Tom apologise?
The results were shocking.
This room is empty.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
Can you believe this?
We spent the night in the open.
Don't lock the door.
When are you free?
Wasn't Tom supposed to do it on October 20th?
I have to go to work now.
Who is this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?
Smell is one of five senses.
What do you got?
They're afraid of him.
Tom's at work.
Tom's hiding something from us.
He didn't even touch it.
Have you come up with a name for the new baby yet?
I want you to help me with my homework.
I'm not a specialist.
I got a cold from him.
I like Brazil, but I'm still going to Ukraine.
I made you breakfast.
I didn't think you'd let me do it.
I see Tom almost every day after school.
The hump grave will fix it.
The soup is so hot, it can't be eaten.
Why is it so popular?
They pleaded not guilty.
Where'd you get so hurt?
I don't think they're friends.
I made a deal with Tom.
I thought Tom and Mary were friends.
I was expecting good news from them.
Distilled water is tasteless.
Father's in the garden now.
Harry works part-time in a local supermarket.
It's very unlikely I'll be late.
I told them to be wearing hats.
Tom said he was exhausted.
I used to want to be a millionaire.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Tom's planning to break up with his girlfriend.
Where will you be tonight?
Tom closed the door to his bedroom.
I only met Tom for a few months.
You're hopeless!
Tom's a very good violin player.
No one's blaming you.
Next year is Rabbit's year.
Tom almost always takes a bath before supper.
I can take you home.
What have you learned?
Please write down what I say.
Now I'm going to add the last touches.
I can't forget Tom.
I don't have any books.
Tennis is the only sport Tom has.
Go to the fire.
Let me help you.
I was very tired, so I fell asleep right away.
Tom is my favorite singer.
Remember, I love you.
He's said to be a murderer.
Mary didn't want to put on a frank Halloween suit, so she decided to dress up like an amish woman.
Tom's got his hat up.
Tom's been waiting for three hours.
Mary said she's not thirsty.
You knew Tom better than I did.
Maybe people like us shouldn't have kids.
I won't do it again, I promise.
Every morning I go shopping.
The kid pushes.
Tom refused to sign the document.
Tom didn't even slow down.
I don't want Tom to go anywhere without me.

All of our attempts have been for nothing.
He poured himself another cup.
Now I'm going to audition the patient, make sure you've tracked down the correctness of this procedure, so you'll have to go to it tomorrow.

Tom was sleeping in the barn.
You're gonna ruin your eyes.
Tom was tall for his age.
Did you notice Mary's earrings?
You're gonna be late for school again.
What's your favorite movie man?
He didn't have to ask me twice.
You need to go to Boston.
I jumped out of joy.
She's rich, young and beautiful.
Do you love your country?
I rarely see you and Tom.
I'm pretty tall.
From a practical point of view, there are many shortcomings in his plan.
This is the house I live in.
I go to school with him.
You look like you don't agree.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
I don't know what I mean.
I went to Harvard.

If it's inexpensive, I'll buy it.
I told Tom what to do.
She almost drowned.
It was a good movie.
Are you wet?
I'll never let you forget it.
Tom told me not to talk to you.
Who were you gonna sell it to?
I don't want a divorce.
I grew up in Australia.
Tom let his anger go.
The missing boy was identified by his clothes.
I have good reflexes.
Tell me what it was like.
She will likely refuse to follow his counsel because she does not like him.

I know you work for them.
I hope I can help you.
Do your parents know about this?
The waitress put a white tablecloth on the table.
I stayed home that day because it was raining.
Is there a pharmacy around here?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why is Tom staring at me like that?
I called the police and told them my car was stolen.
We can talk about this later.
It's a bit of a help.
Cats in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.
Can I be frank?
I work for an oil company.
Why don't you find someone else who needs your help?
Tom put a wet towel on Mary's forehead.
He hurt his left arm.
Is she Italian?
We want to go.
The population of this city is declining every year.
Dan didn't want to sound shy.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Did you find the difference between the two photos?
I've never seen so many books in one place.
You look a little depressed.

Cats have a woolly tongue.
I would never do that.
Fix it, please.

Take another cookie.
I'm sleepy!
You must be an idiot.
Tom's in the park.
I didn't think you'd be here today.
"Who are you by nationality?" - "Argentinians."
Why are you sad?
I can do it a lot better than you can.
Don't forget!
I really think so.
The umbrella's broken.
Tom's got his room cleaned up.
Did you file a complaint?
I don't love Tom very much.
So we're gonna have to change our plans.
Someone bit him.
Is there anything else you want to know?
Tom said he wanted to see us before he left.
But I don't have the money.
How do you like Mary's new dress?
There was fear on his face.
If you don't tell her, I will.
Can I trust you with a secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a singer.
Shall we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your fault.
Tom told everyone he was adopted.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Take her somewhere.
I was just there when it happened.
Her origin is unknown.
Smell it.
Tom wakes up from a deep sleep.
You're big.
Where'd you see him?
I don't know why you want me to do it.
I hope to see him on Monday.
Are you sure you want to sell your dad's guitar?
There are no girls on the Internet.
They'll find you.
I'm trying to figure out why this happened.
We'll send them a card.
If you don't want to answer, you don't have to.
Look left and right, before you cross the road.
Tom was my friend, too.
I didn't know her back then.
We've heard those promises before.
What were you and Tom doing after dinner?
I'm very dissatisfied.
As is often the case, Mike was late for a meeting this afternoon.
Tom told me Mary had a new boyfriend.
We're not gonna let that happen.
These fools have broken the law against breaking the law.
It's not done yet.
John was talking so loud, I heard it on the second floor.
Tom checked his eyesight.
I didn't give it to Tom.
There's a strange rumor going on.
I know you're rich.
Bill put a hundred dollars on a trip.
He was in the navy.
Who taught you to dance?
Tom snorted his nose.
I wouldn't be surprised.
I'm not lying.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want this to happen.
How much more wine to buy?
I'm not gonna do this.
He got in the car and left.
Tell Tom about everything that's happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All the models are wrong, but some are useful.
I don't have time to do my homework.
That's a big step forward.
Pray for me, Tom.
We don't know the side effects of this drug yet.
Tom's teeth have been in pain for three days.
You seem to know everyone here.
Hope dies last.
That's the girl who came in last night.
I'll give you a new one.
I thought you said it was yours.
Where'd he get those boots?
Don't make me do it.
What were you smiling at?
Tom usually drives a bus to work.
Fadel went to school.
I used to work with Tom.
Tom and I are teammates.
Leave him alone!
My heart beats more every time I see it.
Am I the only one who thinks so?
Everyone but Tom has hats.
She gives him whatever he asks.
Is this for sale?
I'm getting mad.
Do you have a bigger one?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
That only makes the problem worse.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of a washing can in the toilet.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They've already left.
Can I borrow your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jesse standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's some sugar in the bag.
I used to do it when I was a kid.
Something very good has happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't get involved in other people's business.
Who's in the blue T-shirt?
Tom has an American accent.
I don't have the money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
Carrots are good for the eye.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I'd write her a letter.
She kept herself for marriage.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.
Tom shaved.
It's half a third.
The lion is strong.
I needed to make sure he was here.
She said she didn't know the rules.
Education is one of the most important aspects of life.
The boy fixed the hat.
Why don't we go for a walk?

Have you read them?
I told Tom I wouldn't help him.
Tom's sorry he left Boston.
I don't like this shop.
Tom speaks terrible French.
I don't remember how much I paid for it.
Don't you sing with us?

I barely got on the train.
I don't like to argue.
Do you like sci-fi movies?
I'll make her happy.
Just tell him I called.
I don't want to go up.
His house is over the hill.
It was Sunday, and I didn't get up early.
How many pens!
Mary, are you all right now?
I made a mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 push-ups.
I'm sure you can do the job.
After Mary slapped Tom, threw a glass of wine through him, and a solid step out of the restaurant, there was a dead silence.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We recognized them.
Tom's gonna dye the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you're gonna need a loan.
Tom's dad, in prison, never writes to Tom.
It's expensive.
I haven't heard from him in years.
I didn't know Tom couldn't swim.
I thought it was time we all met.
Everyone's interested in Japan.
Tom's getting very mad.
Please, just do it like I do.
Stay there.
I don't agree with him.
That's what it's called luck.
It was so dark in the room, I had to get through it.
How many U.S. Army carriers?
She's your teacher?
Sing it again, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom understands he's no longer needed.
Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in pots in winter.
I speak French.
If it sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where you found it.
Tom should have told Mary.
Why is everyone staring at me?
Tom kissed Mary last night.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my dad.
I told you this was gonna work.
It all seems so strange.
Tom decided to go.
You've taught me a lot.
What time do you wake up?
Take the trash out.
Tom apologized to the listeners.
Tell Mary I have her keys.
Did you get some candles?
Canada is home to ice hockey.
The brain is a very complex organ.
They'd agree.
Your Japanese is good.
The thief broke through the window.
Spiders are abhorrent little creatures.
I want to know where it is.
Kiss without a mustache like soup without salt.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where are the rest of the prisoners?
There's so much going on today.
I saw a car hit a man.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom was working with Mary.
I'm so tired.
Do you know what your kids are doing now?
Do you want her to stay?
He misses her.
Tell me, please, I'm right.
We saw a lock in front of us.
Tom kept tickling her.
Six goes in front of the family.
I went to my grandpa's grave today.
Tom couldn't believe someone was gonna kill him.
Tom didn't dance with Mary.

Tom and Mary stopped laughing when they noticed John was crying.
I have to meet Tom.
Tom lost his finger.
Did you sign the contract?
I told Tom he should talk to a lawyer.
Did they get on the wrong bus again?
Let Tom go home.
I'm not hungry either.
He's got a lot of girlfriends.
This area has completely changed.
Tom's an anti-Semitic.
What is your most powerful side?
Tom doesn't like being pushed.
I wonder if when Angelique Agurbash sang a song to Neklov's words, she imagined he'd run for president.
There's yogurt in the fridge.
Can you tell us what's going on?
Tom's always being frank.
Thomas has to be there by 2:30.
Show me Boston on the map.
Tom said he was very exhausted.
Tom wasn't in his room?
Why aren't you looking for him?
They survived even though the building was destroyed.
I wouldn't want anything better.
Tom wants popcorn.
My favorite restaurant burned down.
John's indiscreet, he's making a lot of mistakes.
Tom interviewed Mary.
Tom is my personal assistant.
Who's this guy?
Keep the kids out of the pond.
Let's talk about it tonight.

Stop it!
I knew what the Jacksons were doing.
You don't have to apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one grandson and three grandchildren.
He wants peanut butter.
You're so lucky.
Tom's starting to get a little drunk.
I barely understood him.
He got away with the bait.
You can live in a big house and still not feel comfortable.
I expect Tom to tell me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one is two.
Red's better.
The universe is endless.
I'm not ready to do it yet.
Thank you for coming.
What do you want to say?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can I have a word with Tom?
Don't make such a fuss.
When did Tom get arrested?
We eat at 6:00.
The deer was the victim of a lion.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom's a little younger than your daughter.
I've done everything I can to save Tom.
Try to get her to help us.
Are you with us?
Make a wish.
Tom's alive.
The brass may be in the water for ten years, but it won't make it a crocodile.
Tom pretended he didn't know what Mary was trying to tell him.
I saw it happen.
I think there can be no other reason than this.
I'm very happy right now.
My apartment was mugged last week.
How do you always be so strong?
Put your signature here.
What an ego!
So you bought it?
A man as old as he is and a woman as she looks.
Wisdom comes with age.
Do you remember what you told me?
Last year, there was a lot of snow.
He tried to cross the river.
Everyone seems to be happy.
Tom told Mary to tell the truth.
You don't want another girl?
I like to go down the river.
You might as well come with me.
This dictionary is a big gift to us.
"How long till supper?", "Five minutes."
Let her know.
Mary spent all her time working.

Have you ever been to Scandinavia?
Can I open my eyes now?
I don't want to play cards.
I want to keep working here.
I live in Latvia.
I've been waiting for him until ten.
Tom usually says the first thing in his head.
Why do you want to go?
How's French for good-bye?
It didn't cost that much.
What's wrong with your computer?
We've both been busy.
I'm fine.
We're not gonna fire you.
Do you really think Tom can swim?
How are you gonna spend so much money?
Mary likes hanging out with bad guys.
It is often said that every week in the world disappears in one language.

What did Tom bring?
That's exactly what I was looking for.
Tom noticed the door was open.
That's when I hit my tibia.
I have nothing more to say about it.
What other choice did I have?
You should stay up there.
Come home early, Bill.
She was sitting on a chair and reading the magazine.
From now on, we are not allowed to weep.
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
This is the house he lived in.
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to a monkey.
Do you want to eat my chocolate?
It's painted in white, it's more like a house.
I've had difficulty finding the original quote.

What's the point of doing this?
Which dog is yours?
You have to give Tom more time.
You didn't tell me what Tom spoke French.
Tom's back in Boston next week.
Why aren't you helping me?
I was watching a movie in French with English subtitles.
I'll have lunch.
I think Tom was a good player.
He only blames the others, he never blames himself.
Do you know how to play a banjo?
Tom went up to Mary and hugged her.
"When are you coming back?" - "All depends on the weather."
How long do turtles live?
How safe is it?
Your message has been received.
It took me three years to complete my house.
I was irritated.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
We'll see if we can do this.

All of a sudden, I know what's going on.
She said she'd be late.

Let me talk to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I failed.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
Sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy this.
I've never seen you in a hat.
Put it on the shelve.
I thought you found someone else.
There's always a lot of vehicles on this road.
You tricked us all.
I don't think Tom has any brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
There's no point in pretending to make me believe that I believe in what you don't believe!
I think it would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I was pardoned.
I appreciate your support.
Do you think it's possible?
He got sick to do it.
You think Tom's closed?

It's just superstition.
Tom has to make his own decisions.
The bill, please.
Your shoes always have to be clean.
You're about to have a birthday.
Count it.
I don't like those boots.
Tom was married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I downloaded on the Internet.
I think Tom's less than 30.
Have you been drinking?
No doubt he's the best man for this job.
You're making it easy for me to do my job.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just go.
I'm loved.
You don't seem too busy.

Don't tell Tom what really happened.
I'm not just gonna give you this.
What do you say?
Did you talk about your hobbies?
Come down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed my friends these postcards.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I threw the ball.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized to us.
He read this book yesterday.

Tom gave me both the money and the advice.
What do you want me to say?
Please open the door.

There's a lot of girls in the room.
He's talking too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in her coffee.
You didn't know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to buy time.
I've already discussed it with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke in a terrible, from the point of view of the Jews, the Galilee dialect of the Aramaic language, instead of Hebrew, thus demonstrating the incompleteness of the claims of the existence of a sacred language, the use of which, in prayer, makes it especially closer to God.
In the end, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is a bit different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
So they paid $300 for it.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom's gonna do.
The weather is not wrong.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll have Tom make you something to eat.
I'm gonna go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom didn't wear a tie.
That's my answer!
I heard him sing in the shower.

Is this my book?
Washing is routine work.
Who else is on your list?
Don't give Tom my phone.
I've already decided who I'm gonna go with.
I'd like to know what to tell them.
Tom's kids must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you need to talk to them.
He's reading physics in Oxford.
He hid that fact from me.
Did you save me?
He snored loudly in his sleep.
What's your favorite browser?
Tom recognized Mary by voice.
You don't even look at me.
Tom's too lazy to do it.
Please stop fighting.
Grandpa always said there would be days like today.
That's not what I told her.

Someone said something, but I didn't get it.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I've never been worried about them.
Tom was able to get to the hospital on his own.
I sat next to Tom.
You sound a bit disheartened.
Have you always been so selfish?
I think this medicine will be of great use to you.
Tell Tom to be here by half three.
It's not God's news what a science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it's gonna rain.
Would you like a beer?
Where'd you see him?

Where do you want to go next weekend?
How wonderful is this?
I'm hungover.
Tom wasn't polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car is good for sale.
I have work to do this weekend.
You can't do this to us.
His words embarrassed me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what Tom had to do.
Say hi to her for me.
Was it a lie?
Tom's answer shaken everyone up.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom back?
I've got to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it at the store.
The world is brutal.
I'm having a sensitive dream.
No one cares but himself.
I'm from Shizuoka.
Tom saw all the trees in his backyard.
Saturday is the day he's free.

She didn't give me anything.
I see.
He texted his parents.
I'm happy with what I have.

Don't blame yourself.
What do you want to talk about?
Tom's yelling at Mary.
It's my favorite song.
Don't leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom used to say Mary was from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very perceptive.
Over and over again, there are obstacles in our lives, some call them problems, others talk about opportunities for growth.
Thank you for taking him fishing.
You won't have this problem.
I prefer to spend time with my friends.
Find a solution.

Are you working tonight?
The wind slammed.
I rarely met her.
I know it's really important.
I'm eating an apple.

Shall we go?
I knew I could count on you!
Tom put wood in the fire.
"Love has never killed anyone." "Are you going to ask Romeo and Juliet?"
What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It's like a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I shouldn't have let her go.
Tom died a year and a half ago.
I knew you'd come back.
These books are old.
Are we leaving yet?
Neither Tom nor Mary have ever been to Boston.
Have you ever sucked?
If I had the money, I'd buy a computer.
Tom's smiling?
She went to Paris.
Tom's at school, right?
Let us know, please.
Tom nodded and headed to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove I'm wrong.
I told you to stay in your room.
Do you have any pain anywhere?
He couldn't go because of a lack of money.
Let me tell you how this works.
Open the door, or we'll break it!
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't give up French.
I think we can trust Tom.
There's a lot of riddles in life.
Isn't it too salty?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's an apple that's rotten.
Tom said he didn't have any money.
Boston is Tom's favorite city.
It's a pity when someone dies.
Are you feeling better?
What makes you think we might be interested?
I'll think of you every day while I'm gone.
That was a bad bet.
The thought of her going alone was disturbing me.
The river is running smoothly.
He looks like Johnny Depp.
I've been watching them.
Do you really love her?
He gave a statement of the facts without comment.
He was dark green.
He'll come.
Got a message?
I got a phone call from Tom yesterday.
We really need this.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the glasses.
I've decided to give up.
An accident took their only son.
Everyone knows there's something new in this old capital.
I'm always careful.

Do we have a chance to win?
I knew I needed to stay home.

I'm proud of you.
She doesn't like my way of talking.
Mary wants another baby.
I don't care what you do with your money.
I'd like to see the boss.
Tom didn't go to Boston by car.

How's your dad?
Did they say when?
This car looks mad.
Do you learn English?
Are you my enemy?
She asked for some money for a new dress.
Why is the moon glowing at night?
I couldn't figure out anything Tom was saying.
You won't need this any more.
Tom did it on purpose.
Let's think about it.
I know Tom wants you to do it.
Tom said he didn't know anything about the robbery.
Do you know everyone here?
Tom couldn't read until he was 13.
I prefer quail eggs.
She lives in Muhosransk.
Those people who aren't smarter than I am, I'm not interested.
Is this your first visit to Australia?
Owls are wise.

Which floor does Tom live on?
There are no direct flights to Bologna from here.
I live out of town.
Give me a few hours.
Don't make yourself eat if you don't want to.
I have a job for Tom.
"How did the accident happen?" - "Nobody knows."
What do you like about it?
When I got to the station, I called a friend of mine.
I need to buy a plane ticket to Moscow.
We met last week.
Don't believe anything he says.
Tom was freed from his foreign accent.
We all knew it was gonna happen sooner or later.
No one objected.

I fell asleep on his shoulder.
I know you work a lot.
I love Ural.
I hope you're wrong about that.
Sometimes you have to tell the truth.
Tom's a pusher.
I have a suggestion for you.
Did she like dinner?
I think Tom was crying.
Tom and I are planning to get married on October 20th.
If you want to be alone, I'll go.
He's got a lot of talent.
He's in a bad mood.
How would you like to be called?
He has a Japanese father.
Who would want to kill him?
I was in a hurry.
He says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he was exhausted.
He stays up late in the night.
Tom's room is very small.
Do you speak Italian?
The girl smiled at me.
This song is doomed to succeed.
I'm gonna surprise you.
We've shown them what we know.
I'm proud of him.
I just got home.
Tom burns both wood and charcoal in his furnace.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We have to be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take it with me, okay?
Tom left Mary his keys.
I talk to him all the time.
I can't help but laugh at her jokes.
By means of the prophet Zechariah, God foretold the reconciliation in Jesus Christ of royal authority and priesthood.
You want me to talk to Tom myself?
Every one of us went to his house.
The string is thin, but strong, and it doesn't break.
It's all kind of stupid.
I don't know what I want right now.
This is incredible.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six to five in favor of TV viewers!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom's interested in biology.
She tried to kill him.
Was he really that bad?
Tell me, please, where you're gonna live.
They all need attention.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we get Tom?
Tom said I wasn't pretty.
Do you cry a lot?
We did not expect such a result.
I've already read it.
If the car breaks down, we'll go on foot.
Can I touch your hair?
Did you find anything interesting?
Everybody's doing it.
I go to my family a lot.
He'll be expelled from our club.
You have to be punished for what you've done.
They went up the stairs.
She has to drink water.
It's one of the ugliest buildings I've ever seen.
The robber broke into the post office in the middle of the day.
That's why I left.
Why'd you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come too.
With God's help...
I don't like coffee too much.
My table is old.
We're both very busy.
The darkness is impenetrable.
I get what I want.
Are you happy to see me?
I'll pick you up.
Tom tried to drown in the bathtub.
Tom and I are the same size.
I said good-bye.
Tom is Mary’s younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes to play cards.
It's a big book.
Don't talk about Tom like that.
I kind of made myself clear.
We've been waiting for three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Times can change, but the human nature is still the same.
Tom looks pretty upset.
I've got some cookies.
Next year, Tom will be teaching French.
I've been listening to her for the rest of the day.
I told Tom to rest.
Why does it make you mad?
The worst part of the trip is over.
We'll miss you both.
Don't be so shy!
I heard it on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in the shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you do it!
I really needed this knife.
How do you know what I had?
You're just gonna have a minute.
This is a situation I would very much like to change.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to trust any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a squirrel in a wheel.
He never got over it.
Do you want to come with us?
Does Tom know how to swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We're planning to leave as soon as possible.
He went skiing in Hokkaido.
"Shut up your fucking music and read the book." "I see my censoring spell still works!"
You knew her better than I did.
I've already talked to Tom about it.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no salvation for her.
I'm sorry I didn't do it without you.
You're bleeding out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants what you want.
We can't just ignore it.
Where did you and Tom meet?
Where's the supermarket around here?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you're not, join us.
Tom wanted to ask Mary to apologize again.
Tom was thoughtful.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He's never been.
I'd really like to go with you, but I can't.
It's never happened before.
I wasn't gonna do it.
I can't trust you.
I got some bread.
Let's hurry up or you'll be late for school.
You ever write a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary traded places.
How do they put you out?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a man of peace, but it's hard to imagine what I can do when my family is at risk.
Mary made Alice a new dress.
That decision was hard to make.
I thought you'd be thirsty.
I got what you asked for.
He said he'd do it.
He didn't have to go.
Mary recovered from her illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get this?
The eating of meat harms your health and your environment.
You're telling me you don't know anything about this?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom doesn't know how to enjoy life.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
No one likes me.
I wish I knew Tom's phone.
- "Do you tell him?" - "No, he found out."
Your explanation was very clear.
I overslept the rest of the day.
I understand in French.
I'm just sure you've just been thinking about something nasty.
The Sahara is the world's largest source of dust.
What do you like best in Boston?
I want to be alone.
They've been waiting for the signal to start.
I told them not to tell anyone.
We have a lot to buy.
I read an interesting book last night.
Tom's gonna pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is a weeping owl.
I don't have this book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is in the center of the solar system.
You're a cop?
Tom failed both me and Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut myself with a razor.
Tom and Mary seem to be more than just friends.
The river irrigated the garden.
A strong wind shut up at night.
Ants and giraffes are long-distance relatives.
Tom did it because I told him.
I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need it.
Tom was carrying two suitcases.
Tom didn't seem to recognize me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her myself.
When do you leave?
Don't slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just got off the phone with your teacher.
I used to go to bed early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom's in the office.
All Tom does is watch TV.
Tom's in a good mood tonight.
It's the best pears I've ever had.
I had a problem with the parking.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do this.
She's not mine.
Do you know what this is?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
Tom was never late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go ask your dad.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a short comment on each page.
It's hard to take you seriously.
Members of the tribe settled along the river.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When's the start?
No one cares what she thinks.
I don't think it's weird at all.
"Where'd you get my phone?" - "Tom got it."
When are you gonna clean up the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Is there any point in fixing it?
Why are you locking the door?
Tom said he tried it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at 8 a.m.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You don't know how to write a program.
Change the subject.
I like to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's not tall, but strong.
It's cool this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Can you find Tom, please?
He'll give it to you.
The sentence is not clear.
What would you do?
He vanished in the crowd.
Don't you know what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom divorced Mary last year.
Where'd you put my cigarettes?
This lesson is endless!
This box weighs a ton.
He's getting it all because he's an ass.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he's never met her.
It was like he was gonna kiss me.
Don't yell at me.
Are you having fun?
I don't think that's gonna happen.
I'll order it later.
You didn't know Tom was on his way to Boston?
This is our school.
I've been free all day yesterday, and I've been working today.
Take your coat, it's cold tonight.
If you think about it, I really need a mobile phone.
Don't lose your patience.
Why is Tom mad?
What a terrible man!
The cardboard is solider than the paper.
Don't be mad at him.
You've overstepped your authority.
The curse was destroyed.
Tom's great-grandfather was born blind.
Tom's taller than you, right?
She hurt her back playing tennis.
Tom's easy to frighten.
This table is white.
It was a strange game.
I've heard of all your problems.
I've known him for a year.
I'm going to Boston with you.
Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer, they went to a mountain resort.
Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay out of there.
Tom and Mary are not afraid.
Can you get closer?
She's a bit shy.
What do you expect Tom to do?
She seemed completely quiet.
Press the button.
Tom went to the museum with Mary.
Tom was intrigued by what was going on.
Mary wore her boots to her knee.
That's a lie.
I'll keep an eye on them.
She said she got a cold.
The Roadmaster was very rude.
Tom wants to follow his dad's steps.
I don't see a problem here.
I don't have to do this tomorrow.
He's lost his sunglasses.
It's horribly bitter.
Did Tom tell you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on the way to work.
I don't know what you're talking about!
The last time, Tom was the first.
Everyone's different.
I need to see you.
I lost your phone.
Plant the tree over there.
Do you usually wear a bike helmet?
Tom's gonna fix it.
Tom said good-bye to his sister.
Mother was busy cooking supper.
I don't know what you're trying to say.
The little pots have long pens.
Tom was in sandals.
There's a bench under the tree.
Let me tell you what I want you to do.
Are you gonna stop me?
How do you like my story?
Tom turned off the alarm and fell asleep again.
Tom and Mary looked tired.
I heard you sing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?
Tom often plays the guitar.
I was trying to warn Tom.
The train was full.
Tom rarely wears a tie.
You bought too much bread.
He says he's not planning to go.
I have two dogs, three cats, and six chickens.

Don't forget to sign.
You'll be safe there.

"Do you speak Greek?" - "No, it's my first lesson!"
Why'd you give him the money?
Did Tom buy anything for Mary?
You went to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis last night.
Let me do it again.
We have to respect their wishes.
How'd you get her to do it?
I've been to Sapporo before.
I told you to get out of here.
We'll do our best.
Would you have bought that?
Tom's gonna miss the plane.

Tell me why you're here.

How much time do you have?
Writing a SMS with a car is very dangerous.
Tom said Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary wouldn't win.
Why did you shave your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How many pens do you have?
The pottery of the fork was broken.
Why don't you go kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you tell Thomas to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he should tell me.
I was very quiet.
Everyone has something to hide.
We'll have a few guests tonight.
Her voice is still ringing in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time heals everything.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.

All men are the same.
Are you hot?

What'd you find?
Can you explain that to me?

What do we have to lose?
You'd better ask him first.
He was fired against his will.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom tell you where he bought his pipe?
She never answered the letter.
I hired someone to work today.
Stop fooling around!
Tom would want us to stay.
I'll take the stairs.
It's the world's biggest car.
Tom hardly ever asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me Mary didn't do it like that.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I've already done it.
What's the weather?
I texted her.
You owe me $300.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
You're not gonna introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know I'll always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She was crying.
I told Tom Mary to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like to live out of town?
How long have you had?
We've finally got everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's boss.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone was yelling.
What's the best?
We thank you for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell Tom to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train leaves at 3:30.
I know you're hiding something.
Release the animals from the cage.
He's afraid of cats.
You look like a dad.
George is five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you're told.
Please watch this movie.
Someone's on the phone.
I ran.
Why aren't you ready?

We have to help.
Tom just got out of jail.
Did you tell Tom?
Me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've made a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did all this.
I don't want to listen to your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
Only in philosophy can a vicious circle be used in the evidence, and it is highly appreciated.
I can't afford to have kids.
When I was talking to them in French in Paris, they were just staring at me, and they couldn't get the morons to understand their own language.

She really did.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll open it.
My mother must be mad.
White bread, please.
Owls are cute.
Tom is illiterate.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We're perfect for each other.

He doesn't like fish.
The danger is over.
We need more firewood.

Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he does.
He must miss her.
He says he's not sick.
Is Paris far?
What time is it in Tokyo?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Kalo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming tonight.
You become a dad, you know.
Last Monday, I saw you and Tom.
Where'd you take off your shoes?
We went to the beach.
Do you think it's gonna be snowing for Christmas this year?
How was Tom's party?
I have to go to the toilet.
I borrowed a tent from a friend.
I'll work for you while you pay me as well.
I'd like a cup of coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth in a while.
You're the only one here who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would do.
You're not gonna get a second chance like this.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
All the bills have to be paid to me.
She clapped.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom's dragging Mary's hair.
Tom didn't seem happy to me.
When I grow up, I want to be a fireman.
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.
We forgot to sign up!
Tom said he likes it here.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She's the lazy one I know.
Mary cleaned up her room yet?
I'll forgive him this time.
I really like Chinese.
It's simpler than you think.
Tom wasn't a good trainer.
He's sober.
Álvaro is from Venezuela, and he's Venezuelan.
Here's the bill.
He publicly offended me.
Tom won't win again.
Why don't I stay with you?
Magnets are used in the induction plates for the direct heating of the pot and pans.
I was crying.
Tom wants to learn how to play trombone.
Come out now.
Can I see your license?
I'll get you 1,000 pesetas to replace the lightning on those jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot his sweater.
Tom still lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly where to start.
What a memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two concert tickets.
I should have gone to Australia with you.
Tom baked pancakes.
He was dictating a number of letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you wearing your pajamas?
How much is it?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to take care of the garden.
A cup of rice weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I should have left Tom a note.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I've been waiting for Tom since half three.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was miserable.
Tom and Mary do it together.
Did anyone else notice that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom's kind.
She played a sonate.
You can write in any language you want. In Tatoeba, all languages are the same.
The infection's in the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a gift.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
Someday you'll thank me.
Tom watches TV sometimes.
I'm ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I'm still not thinking well.
Run, chickens!
I had a terrible dream last night.
The net is big.
You're sick of me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current state of affairs.
I know what you told her.
I only fell asleep after 2:00 a.m.
Mary was not thirsty.
It wasn't as hard to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom up.
They say it's a very interesting movie.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late for the heavy rain.
Looks like she's all right.
Tom was wearing a straw hat.
Keep an eye on your brother.
Tom said he wasn't gonna wait for permission.
It's time to end.
Have you had dinner yet?
I love bitter pepper.
What time do you usually get up on Saturday?
I put milk in the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympics.
I've never betrayed you.
We used to do it together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There's no invincible.
Tom wins.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I know Tom can draw.
They're messed up.
I didn't know it would be impossible to do it.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snowing last night?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you try it on?
Does Tom know French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
I was impressed.
I suggest you don't go.
We didn't talk about it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't figure out why no one else wanted to go to the pet.
That was persuasive.
Tom shot Mary in self-defense.
What is the difference between faith and trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What'd you find out?
If the weather allows, we'll climb up to the top of the mountain tomorrow.
She and I both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve a problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed the sun was the eye of God Ra.
Tom saw it?
The more I thought about the problem, the harder it seemed.
His grey eyes glittered and sparkled, and his usually pale face came to life and was covered in a bleach.
What kind of pizza do you like the most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands got blue from the cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Typhoon has destroyed a lot of homes.
This man was doomed to die.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Can anyone here speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I don't know how to dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you wearing my boots?
The power is in Tom's hands.
I've learned to study and play like my Japanese friends.
Why are you staring at me?
No one's gonna blame you.
I'm not at all busy right now.
Children like to play more than to learn.
He was seen as his little brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my dad.
Guess what language I'm speaking.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on talking about politics.
Is it red or white?
We're not afraid of a fight.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Come on!
Do it before it gets dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
Did the moustache suddenly become fashionable?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're sad.
Our granddaughter was born the day before.
Tom's wearing a pirate suit.
That's the truth!
Let's go get the tree.
What are these people doing?
I've done my best.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom should be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink any more wine.
I'll help you out.
We are proud of our achievement.
So I should've invited Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought last night.
She's his sister, not a girl.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She's become a mailman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop hitting the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know this man is who he pretends to be?
King Harald Hormsson, more known as Harald the Synosub, introduced Christianity in Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
There's nothing wrong.
The last days have been very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never met Mary.
You can't go to this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very talented and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read Herman Gesse.
In fact, I've never spoken Portuguese.
When criminal cases go to court, it is common for the jury to have 12 members.
What exactly was Tom doing at the Australian Embassy?
Tom and I started dating.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very confused.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is sour.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was gonna do it.
Well, it's been another day.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're unbiased.
I have muffin bites all over my arm.
Tom, come on, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
You're watching your weight?
Tom's a trombone player.
You're from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonalds is world-famous for his hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a dear gift.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like these perfumes?
The lock's broken.
Diamond is a gem.
Have a cookie, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Stand down, Sergeant.
No one can do this.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How'd you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want what's best.
Tom's a waiter.
It's gonna be cold tonight.
She says she can wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
Was it too easy?
What Alice was up against, waiting for an answer, was a sudden war, it was a sound of sound, so sharp to break her drumsticks, and so loud to get to the sky.
I lost it in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he entered the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
So you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get her stuff in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I've done is wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I've been trying to solve the problem in vain.
You should have done your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
That stone was so heavy I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
He'll be able to respond as he speaks.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tasted a banana pie?
The girl who gave me the pretty flowers is your sister.
Well, isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we explain this to the kids?
I didn't even know your name.
The ape climbed a tree.
The language I'm learning is very complex.
Your kid can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Do you really live alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom's the youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President has been ruling for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Can you settle this?
Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
There's 20 floors in the building.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
You don't know when Tom's coming back, do you?
I don't have a picture of Tom.
Can you wait a bit?
You're gonna give something to Tom for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he followed my advice then, he'd be a rich man now.
I made that decision on my own.
Can you say it again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the guts to try and jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you okay?
He's as stubborn as a donkey.
I think I can count on you.
She knew she was wrong.
This is so cool!
Tom had a feeling Mary was gonna bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say it again!
I called him, but a girl answered the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she was gonna win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom's very hard on kids.
How's the negotiation going?
He's ready for the worst.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got a small moustache.
Do you know what she said?
You seem a bit distracted.
Don't make her mad.
I'd rather stay.
So I thought of a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place secure?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and clean.
I suspect Tom has to go to Boston next week.
Don't go on another man's land.
Tom was horrifying.
Tom's face is red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where are you and Tom staying?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done here.
How do you like your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very content.
Hungry for him was an abstract concept; he always had enough food.
We need a new curtain in the hall.
Can you stay with them?
Tom got here early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's sleeping.
You sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her legs hurt.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to talk to you about something important for both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What's the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do it a lot.
I hope we don't do it again.
How many times have you helped Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, there'll be a time to open.
I'm not sure how big she is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as it stops raining.
Thomas left the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help but think of Tom.
Tom told everyone Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire it?
He and I wept.
You don't want to try again?
Wait a bit longer.
Why are you dressed like this?
You can make butter, cheese, and so on.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you're drinking water, don't forget the ones who dug a well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was gonna buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an intruder.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He winked back.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
Have you ever thought about asking Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I'm eating like a pig.
Can you say that in a human language?
No one's hungry but me.
Tom's very excited.
No snowflakes in the snowvale think it's their fault.
Who do you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she's saying.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russia dictionary?
I just want you to know I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'll solve this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When does the shop open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He widened his mouth.
It's just spitting.
I really loved this book.
You're important.
When the ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she'd stay at her place for the night.
Tom didn't tell the cop his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish are still raw.
Try to stay positive.
I was sick.
She suffocated him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Will it hurt?
The girl was wearing a big red hat.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was tricked.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who do you want to play with Tom?
I need a light coat.
I finished my assignment.
It's a cat.
Please tell me it's not true.
Won't you come in?
I renovated his radio.
That's a very bad idea.
Tom's taller than you.
Tom just found a job.
Is this book in public?
Please, can you talk a little bit louder?
I'll tell Tom to get in touch with Mary.
I helped them.
He looks like a girl.
Please come to me, no less than Jacob Matveyevich.
She's not alone anymore.
Tom never admits he's wrong, because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
I've been to America before.
It took more time than I expected.
Mary stayed with her dad.
I thought I could trust her.
Do you have Stevie Wonder's new album?
I was thrown out of my house because I didn't pay my rent.
Tell me where you went.
He stopped resisting and subdued to his fate.
It was on Park Street.
Eduardo's younger than Roberto.
The moon is a satellite of the Earth.
I don't know, go to bed!
There's no point in nature.
No, she never fell in love.
You did it on purpose!
You won't need it.
Tom rarely goes to a party.
You're not my mother.
Tell them we're on our way.
Do I look like a guy who wants to get married?
I closed the door, but I didn't lock it.
He should be careful not to kiss Mary in public.
Are we gonna help them?
Thank you for calling me back.
They're happy.
Please don't be so hard on me.
Now I'm in charge of the parade!
People, good year for us all.
I don't pity you.
I know Tom won't give up.
I don't really like her.
He's not here.
You're very smart.
Tom and I are planning to get married on October 20th.
She thought I'd let her down.
I live in Boston now.
Tom took his secret to his grave.
You really want to put your money in that bank?
I don't think anyone else wants to do this.
We're a teacher.
You must like me a lot.
Why are you so worried about her?
I'll never do it again.
Do the aliens exist?
Emily wants to be an electrician.
These books are better than those.
Don't try to remember every sentence in the text, it's almost impossible.
He's been in French for eight years.
I thought it was you.
Personally, I think you're right.
I can't believe I did it after all.
The candle's finished.
Why don't you get us something to drink?
We're collecting blankets for the homeless.
Tom paid Mary a very decent wage.
What do you think?
Let's get your breakfast ready.
Tom doesn't know why I didn't win.
Never in my life!
Did Tom ever ask you to help him?
The chair needs to be fixed.
I thought you were right.
Why is everyone looking at us?
Where's Tom's key?
Did I say your name right?
No one saw her leave the room.
Wa-bank.
Tom will never find it.
All women are the same.
He let them go out in the garden.
I don't have a crystal ball.
Your love is false.
She's about my age.
Did you really do it for free?
You want me to open the box?
Boys will always be boys, and girls will be girls.
You gotta go to bed, turn off the radio.
There's nothing new about his addiction to alcohol.
He's not aware of the risks.
So you don't have to do this anymore.
Do you have any idea who might have done this?
The teacher warned us that the test was likely to be difficult.
I'm a married man.
He bought his son a camera.
Shut up and eat.
I gave you everything.
I'm dedicating this song to you.
I like her better.
You're too small to know what a logarithmic ruler is.
I used to do it almost every day.
I'm deeply shocked.
About a billion people are suffering from hunger and poverty.
I am pleased to inform you that your work has been accepted for publication in the SM.
I'm sure I'm right.
I didn't know you wanted to learn French.
Let's go home.
You have time.
I'm not coming.
Tom doesn't spend much time thinking about money.
So we have to go with Mary.
I wonder what Tom's doing here.
You're not all-powerful.
I don't think I can go any faster.
Tom's got some questions left.
Are you looking for someone?
Tom's hand was bitten by a mureen.
He didn't have to hide.
He'll be out of his parents' house soon.
I don't think he'll hear us.
I want to go to England.
Did you see anyone in the park?
Didn't I warn you not to go there?
Tom moved here from Australia three years ago.
She left Boston.
We need to consider all options.
Tom could have killed me.
Grandpa Ali was a drummer.
Why didn't someone tell us?
He's wearing his pajamas.
I went out to look for Tom in the lobby.
How old were you when you moved to Boston?
He's more or less aware of his problems.
Tom claimed to have seen UFOs.
I know who you were with.
Does Tom have a bike?
What did you ask them?
And it's not bad.
I have breakfast every morning.
It's not a bug, it's a thing.
You got a problem with the car?
At the tourist information center, the map of the city was made available to everyone who wanted to.
I'm so sorry, but I can't.
Tom closed all the windows.
Come as fast as you can.
We're not very hungry yet.
Learn Chinese not to impress your future boss, but to understand what she's saying.
You can add sentences you can't translate yourself.
Mary's always home, right?
Just ignore Tom.
I don't think I'm biased.
I'm sorry, I didn't see it.
I'm a teacher.
I knew Tom was bluffing.
I tried my best.
That's a good sign.
Some believe that they are protected by a guardian angel.
Tom emptied his bank account.
She's at the hotel right now.
What do I get out of it?
He was so curious that he focused on it.
I told him I wasn't interested.
Tom wants to change society.
I thought you didn't see anything.
We're both here for the same reason.
Love is strong, and money is stronger.
I saw him naked.
There's a lot of kids' books in our library.
I didn't let her go home early.
Did you talk to her?
How long will it take to get there?
I didn't mean to disturb you.
We all wished each other luck.
Tom was born three days before Christmas in 2013.
The young girl didn't say anything.
When Tom heard his favorite song on the radio, he couldn't help but begin to sing.
When will this end?
Tom kissed Mary and apologised.
The stain we've got left a mark on the skirt.
Is Tom seeing anyone?
Tom didn't show me anything.
I hate driving.
They're fake.
When you got back, I left.
Did you talk to him today?
I thought you stopped dating him.
Tom's calling Mary.
She's watering the flowers.
My wife calls me a lot when she's going abroad.
You're in bed.
First of all, I would like to make my position clear.
Tom can play banjo.
Tom didn't decide what to do.
He doesn't like coffee.
Please turn on the radio.
Don't make Tom cry.
The police can't arrest Tom.
How'd you get in my room?
What do you want to give Tom?
We want to go to Australia.
I have a very low wage.
Tom was hit by a bear.
Tom knows where Mary's going.
You scared them.
Tell her to leave.
I don't know anything about it.
We've been dating for three months.
I'm glad you were there.
They threw me a big party.
This mountain is covered in snow all year.
Tom stopped by Mary's shop to buy sugar.
I like to be red.
Stay out of here.
What's the worst movie you've ever seen?
I thought you hated us.
Think hard before you answer.
Tom says Mary needs more time.
I thought it was a joke and I didn't answer it.
In fact, his name wasn't Tom Jackson.
Is that sarcastic?
Don't do something you'll regret.
Are you jealous of her?
I hope I can stay here for a long time.
The payment will be made on the basis of experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to do sports.
Tom told me you were married.
I thought I wouldn't stay.
We look forward to you and your family.
Did you change her?
I told you I changed my mind.
Why would you say that?
You have to work hard if you want to succeed.
There are no exceptions to Esperanto.
If you need help, tell me.
Can I go home early today?
You wouldn't have survived.
Tom didn't think Mary would be upset.
There's a shopping area in the area.
Mary thinks she's the smartest.
Use your fist.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I remember you.
That's interesting news.
Tom's a bitter drunk.
We don't even know her.
Tom came up with a number of suggestions and checked on Mary before putting it on Tatoeba.
I know where you're hiding your money.
School's finally over.
It's a long pencil.
Does your mother know about this?
Do you really like this kind of food?
Tom looked in the mirror.
I told them not to tell anyone.
That's how Tom died.
The coffee shop is empty.
Write a pencil, please.
We can't leave.
He confessed to his crime.
This is the most beautiful picture I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
He's worried about something.
At times, Claudia was thinking about psychoanalysis.
Tom would never agree to that.
You need to find a job.
He'll be back late tonight, too.
She's very proud of herself.
I left about half the third.
Don't leave the tape in the sun.
I already knew that.
I watched them go.
I'm surprised you remember them.
Hey, I know you.
"Help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help!
Can I open the curtain?
You had no right to do that.
I'm yours.
He vomited just as much as he drank.
May the earth be a thing for you, Father!
Why are you still alone?
I want us to be friends with your sister.
Who were you waiting for last night?
Do you like to sing?
The road is slippery.
Tom's making breakfast.
Come in.
I'm saving it for my grandchildren.
I heard Carol and Will split up.
What do you think of Tom?
Tom says he's never done it.
Tom seems like a nice man.
Help me find her.
Tom didn't give it to me.
I had to get under the fence.
The firemen couldn't stop the fire.
Help has finally come.
It's a horse.
Here's what happened here on Monday.
America has done with slavery.
You don't recognize him?
Luckily, he didn't die in an accident.
He often sits for hours reading books.
I had no idea you could do it.
Tom unloaded the car.
Tom knew something about Mary John didn't know.
No answer.
We need to call him.
You busy?
I shook my head negative.
Tom, there's a phone call for you.
You promised you wouldn't drink tonight.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Go see what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think that's how it works.
I didn't do it.
Tom told me he was coming back.
What time are you arriving tomorrow?
A box of holes.
Did you talk to Tom about this?
Is it a bat?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me what else I need to know.
You can't make me marry you.
It's kind of weird.
The leaves are yellow.
I woke up and she was gone.
We have a lot of food today.
He made a speech in which he supported my point of view.
Mount Kilimanjaro is a sleeping volcano in Tanzania.
Why don't you go with her?
Why didn't you just tell them?
I can't rule it out.
Tom asked me why I never tried to get a driver's license.
I have to go back to Boston.
Please have a seat.
Wake Tom up.
Here's a map.
You should have stayed with us.
Let's pretend we're aliens.
Tom said he wasn't hungry.
I have nothing to say to you.
I'd rather you didn't tell Tom.
I didn't want to go anyway.
I'm not gonna complain.
They kept their love a secret.
She was running to the station just to miss the train.
Don't tell my fiancee that.
Tom's tired of the need to always pay the bill when he and Mary go out on a date.
I strongly suggest you reconsider your decision.
I don't care about your past.
The police searched Tom's car.
Although I felt something strange, I didn't know what it was.
Are you a pig?
I'm joining the army.
Why can't you accept me as I am?
The bear is black.
Tom still doesn't know what Mary did.
I don't know who's gonna be at the meeting.
It's hard to get to the president.
If you're hungry, eat.
I was so freaked out.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll take care of it right away.
I don't trust her.
Six three is 18.
"The Rock" is an anagram for "The Glass."
I've never seen Tom help anyone.
Dan took part in the anti-racism rally.
You did it fast.
I need to set the hours two minutes ahead.
He's on her side.
I didn't forget your betrayal.
I think you did a great job.
She danced so gracefully, she surprised us all.
This is where she worked as a secretary.
They're not so bad.
I thought I had everything.
Don't worry, it's gonna be okay.
It's hard for me to work with Tom.
I'm competitive.
He says his son can count to 100 now.
There's something wrong.
Tom hates this stuff.
There's a small garden in front of my house.
Why didn't they go?
I heard you paid someone to do it.
It's for my friend.
Tom said Mary was innocent.
The tulip is an official flower symbol of our prefecture.
I knew we'd be friends.
I didn't want to lose it.
She's at the hotel right now.
I'm gonna give you some karate lessons.
Don't worry about my dog.
Tom's getting cremated tomorrow.
That's not true.
You're not allowed to do this anymore.
The summer vacations in Karuidsawa were overtaken by tourists.
I saw Tom get on the train.
He didn't do anything wrong.
She's wearing her glasses.
I love this commercial.
It was just water.
I got it for my sister.
I'll never forget how she and I went to Hawaii.
No one heard the call.
How'd it get here?
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to fight.
I'd love to go with you, but I can't.
Shocked by the events of 11 September, the politicians of the world have denounced the terrorists for their reprehensible act.
Please call me Taro.
I know both of them.
Don't you want to meet him?
Now Tom's scared.
You said it was an emergency.
Tom's quite happy.
I didn't want the same thing to happen to me.
I don't know all the students.
You just ruined my life!
Civilians have been killed.
Tom told me to treat people with respect.
He did what you asked him to do.
Excuse me, where are the eggs?
Peace be upon you.
I'm sick of white.
Tom is a violent businessman.
I can't go on Saturday.
We're getting married in October.
Tom and Mary don't agree with you.
We'll see you soon.
Let's get a divorce.
There's no way he's gonna find the keys.
Her way of talking makes me nervous.
Eat what you like.
And then what happened?
You think he likes me?
Tom agreed to help Mary do it.
He prefers not to talk about it.
I let them sleep by noon.
I just wanted to get back to my old life.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I've already told you everything you need to know about it.
Health gives a man a freedom that most people don't know until he's lost.
Does it matter?
I know Tom's secret.
Tom's a man.
This is ridiculous.
No one could believe it.
Tell her I'm fixing the fridge.
That's not surprising.
The hare is bleeding out of the ear.
Postmodernism is different from modernism.
I've already read this book.
God damn it!
He's showing a lot of enthusiasm.
Maybe you should call the police.
Did you report this to the police?
You really think Tom's sick?
I'm not afraid of it at all.
I don't have as much money as you think.
I sell clothes on the Internet.
I could do things faster when I was younger.
I wasn't worried.
John, the tallest boy in our class, has a nickname called "Mr. High."
Tom's leaving tomorrow morning.
I didn't kill them.
Do you recognize him?
I didn't really care.
Tom has a horse.
I shouldn't have come here.
Don't make such a sour face!
Is it white?
Tom got here first.
There's been some strange rumours about them.
This is incredible.
The sky is covered with clouds.
This bird is at risk of extinction.
You're very happy with her.
How do you do?
Tom didn't look like he was having fun.
I'm fed up with everyone.
You said it was important.
He said he'd be back right now.
They have a lot of information.
Everyone in the village called her Green Hood.
I don't want to.
It's time to put the kids to bed.
This job can get you sick of it.
I took a break.
Tom won't mind.
There's nothing.
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
Did you take the medicine?
Many people believe in the corruption of our country's officials.
Did he put off his trousers?
I can't tell the difference between him and his brother.
We can count on it.
I'll go with her.
Did the phone wake you up?
I really need to smack someone.
I don't think Tom has any experience.
Come now.
Last winter, I went to Canada to ski.
That's acceptable.
Tom says he can prove Mary didn't do it.
I was born on January 2, 1968.
I want you to stay away from Tom.
Tom just got out of jail.
The animals are allowed to enter.
Tom's full of hope.
He speaks French, as well as, of course, English.
Move this rock out of here, please.
"Tom's getting married." "Who's the lucky choice?"
I've been thinking about you all day.
That's good news.
I can't pay you.
That's what I found in the cave.
I think I impressed him.
The train will stand at this station for about two minutes.
Grow up, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.
Where do you think it would be the safest place?
I know your dad.
I heard you yelling.
He's the boy who painted this picture.
"Call up" means phone call.
Who would have noticed?
Medication should be used only on the order of a doctor.
Do you have a question?
They're in the woods.
I talk too much.
You show me the way.
The sun is bright.
Coral reefs are full of life.
Tom said he knew what Mary was planning to do.
You never wanted to talk about it.
We hope for the best.
I didn't expect Tom and Mary to be here.
Last night, the temperature fell below zero.
"You can't wear it." "Why not?"
Tom didn't do well.
I knew Tom wasn't in Australia.
My eyes are an ocean that reflects my dreams.
In a city as big as Tokyo, I'd rather walk than drive.
As it turns out here, it's impossible to know now.
Now Tom has his own room.
I didn't know her first.
A lot of votes have been fabricated.
You lied to us, didn't you?
I don't think Tom can help you now.
He'll probably be here soon.
He didn't know what a differential equation was.
I know that for sure.
Be a grown-up, Tom.
Can you tell Tom from his twin brother?
I don't get paid for it.
Tom ripped off the floorboards with a crowbar.
Keep your head down.
How did you know where Tom was?
She says she'll do it on Monday.
Tom's eating too fast.
The popularity of the phone has led to fewer people today writing letters.
I think we're almost ready.
Zhenya came to our town three years ago.
Is that why you're not gonna help us?
My pup is dead, and I'm very upset.
She's taller than her sister.
I have a pink car.
So quiet.
The hottest colors have the hottest spikes.
You better hide.
Tom follows the instructions.
It's just not gonna happen.
They can't afford it.
What colors do you like?
She says she's feeling very tired.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run?
Tom does not know how Iraq differs from Iran.
So they told me not to do it.
Two days ago, I got a cold.
I've been waiting for him.
You don't have to do this.
Let's have a cup of coffee or something.
You have something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom, he'll tell you the same thing.
He saw the helicopter himself and started waving with his hands.
I'm with you.
You want to end up like him?
I've been thinking about it.
I'm waiting for someone.
You're going to the theater tonight?
You have to protect yourself.
There's no air conditioning in my house.
Tom and Mary study French together.
My boss is very cheerful today.
They blocked his offer.
I admire your courage.
Tom was hoping Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't make me do it again.
It's your turn, Bashar!
You're talentless.
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
I went to Boston.
Excuse me, can you repeat the question?
What do you think they're gonna do to Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary will do it.
I don't want anyone to.
Tom's gonna be working this weekend.
Tell her I called.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
The President's attempts to put in place stricter control over arms have been intermittently halted by the powerful arms lobby.
I think we know each other.
You underestimate Tom.
Don't bother Tom.
I'll try to put it in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
You have plenty of time.
We should have planned more carefully.
You need to sleep.
I'm proud my dad's a good cook.
Is there something else you want to tell me?
Thomas tried to explain Masha's situation.
I told her it was a mistake.
He's her manager.
Tom didn't have it.
No one was paying attention to me.
It was thirteen at the time.
I'm gonna take a bus to Boston.
Tom wants to try a new shampoo.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay ahead.
Did you make the coffee?
You could have told the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually talk too fast.
We both speak French.
Find yourself a decent suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
That's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom hid the fact that he was in prison.
We're in favor of Spartacus!
That's how he made his celebration.
Why would Tom need it?
It's an investment.
The truth is bitter.
We don't have time for this.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
Promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
The net!
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've already read it.
It's thanks to you.
As long as certain conditions are met.
She's not like everyone else.
Social media can find a lot of information about a man before you meet him.
What really happened last weekend in Boston?
What's the point of learning?
These peaches aren't very sweet.
I don't think these ink stains can be removed.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay you.
I can't forgive his laziness.
Tell me you're kidding!
I'm a realist.
I hear Tom's been expelled from school.
Tom said he was very single.
I didn't tell my friends I was going to Australia.
Kim is four years older than me.
Why aren't you in uniform?
Tom just wanted to make sure that's what you meant.
Tom sent his daughter to bed without supper.
I'm coming with you.
They cleaned the street from the snow.
Tom and Mary have to do it together.
They offered us their help.
Tom's determined to kiss Masha.
Are you very hungry?
What's gonna happen to him?
Tom and I are good friends.
Where do you think you're going?
I had blood in my urine.
You can't always win.
Tom's kind of a celebrity.
Jimmy knows all about cars.
I've seen them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The picture is on the wall.
Mary said she'd win.
I want this dog.
Is Tom with you?
The boy is afraid of the dark.
I made Tom supper.
Russia has become a second super-Power.
I'm worried about them, too.
He went to the post office to send a letter.
Spread this powder in a cup of water.
Will you go with her?
Let's take one of those ready-made lunches at the station.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go abroad?
Don't blame the government.
Put it in place.
How come you two know each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop the guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent in Manhattan is about $40,000 a month.
You won't find them.
Tom is the only one who survived.
You're gonna buy this car?
You sound like my grandmother.
I don't have any siblings.
Let's see something else.
You think it's an accurate translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We're both very hungry.
That's why there's nothing to do here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't hit the door with your hand.
You have to take his age into account.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forget you don't like pizza.

He's got a broken neck.
What are you talking about?
Last night, you left the bar right when I was gonna bet everyone a booze on me.
Tom told me it was really working.
I want to play chess.
I support you a hundred percent.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.

I hate to wait.
I see him at the club sometimes.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
It was fun last night.

I'm sure he's hiding something from us.
Tom hit him off his feet.
Tom tried to stop Mary from opening the door.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You need to learn more.
You're the only one who can handle the money.
How does one have to do with the other?
I was able to do it a lot faster than Tom.
Don't feed trolls.

Tom couldn't focus.
I like this place.
Tom has no money for a new car.
I didn't know what happened.
They can't run.
Obviously, you've changed your mind.
Every morning he reads the paper.
There's no calories in the water.
I think we should get them to work.
He doesn't need any advice.
Did you go to the shop?
Please help me translate this document.
Tom's acting kind of cryptic.
It'll be more expensive to fly on a plane.
I know both of Tom's brothers.
It's been a big help.
I hope you're lucky.

What does your dad do for a living?
When I met her the other day, she looked very happy.

In time, this event was forgotten.
This shirt is too small for me to wear.
Okay, I won't do it again.
Women are meant to be loved, not understood.

I didn't want any pity.
Right!

I'm in jail now.
Add my name to the list.
Tom ran out of jail through the tunnel.
I wanted her to win.
Order it now.
What crime did they commit?
In a fit of anger, he punched the table with his fist.
I want to tell Tom myself.
Give me some time to think about it.
Could you send me more information by e-mail?
Let's talk about anything, not that.

That's not the point.

Tom's not like us.
Thank you for saving me.
Tom said it wasn't the only reason.
Is this mine?
It's a tower.
Who taught you French?
I don't think I can fix it.
They say the mayor is taking bribes.
I don't have any feelings for her.
So the tooth of wisdom was removed.
This is the last train.

What are you doing?
I've never seen her help her dad.
That's how I know her.
There's nothing more I can do.

He's touched.
They're related.
Tom's got another book out.
It's everyone's a respected scientist.
What month were you born?

I wouldn't live in Boston.
We're always at risk.
I have to cut the cost this month.
I showed Tom my room.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary wants to go.

She was surprised it was so late.
That's the worst you can do!

Tom's a real danger.
It's not his wife.
We can't be fooled again.

The station's 10 minutes from here.
Who are you to decide?
Shake the cat.
Tom's a little busy, so he can't help you today.

I knew Tom wouldn't go.
Do you like to drive?

Mary knows she was wrong.
This skirt's a bit too tight.
Let's try to stay calm.
Tom's in the park with his friends.
She was talking fast.
Tom didn't have to lie to Mary.

Get out of this room.

No one wanted to talk about my country.
Just call me.
Why can't you go to Boston?
You're free to do whatever you want with your money.
Do you want anything?
She left before I got home.
Tom wasn't the only one who was arrested.
You could at least knock!
You're making things worse.
I think you should get some rest.
He's a good man.
I can't guarantee that we can complete the work by next Monday.

Tom really needs you.
I appreciate her loyalty.
Papiamento is a great language.
I don't want to get a haircut.
I believe in love at first sight.
Do you remember their names?
I'm eating couscous.
I didn't wait for them.
Tom changed his mind again.
I'd like to talk to you alone.
I thought you weren't dating him anymore.
This magazine is a good one.
Her clothes got a lot of attention at the party.
They're getting married tomorrow.
She was right, and he was wrong.
They drew lots to go first.
Maybe we should ask him for a way.
Luckily, it worked.
Tom won't call.
He said he was cold.
I like to spend time with my friends.
I didn't know you were Canadians.
If you take the kid out and show him your finger on the moon, the kid will look at the moon, and if you do the same with the dog, she'll look at your finger.

I didn't know who else to call.
I didn't know how unhappy Tom was.
She was born on April 4, 1940.
At the end of this year, there will be an economic crisis.

Tom can't stay.
I panicked.

They were sleeping in the car because they couldn't find the hotel.
She's no more than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't make the people do it.
Let me take it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I hate this color.
Are they sleeping together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still single.

I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I've never talked to Tom.

You can do it.

I've been waiting my whole life for this day.
What have they done to you?
Did he pass the test?
The plane has entered the corkscrew.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any pen pals in Indonesia?
You may have to help her.
Mary passed out.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come to the concert with me?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd love to see you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom's here to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hello," said Tom timidly.
Where are you going?
I almost died last night.
I'm in pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
They're running.
The road does not match the number of cars that pass through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new sentence as a message in a bottle, one day it will be translated.
You won't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
We're soul mates.
I have a granddaughter your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is it a bear?
How'd you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She began to learn from her new office.
Let us take care of it.
I believe you're sitting in my seat.
I was planning on doing it yesterday.
It's a bit early now, isn't it?
My parents don't like my way of dressing.
If you want to stay, you can stay.
It's gonna be fun.
I hit him gently and hard.
What's worse?
It's cheap.
Can I hold your hand?
It's green.
Tom heard a noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom was up all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about cellulitis.
The show has to start watching when all the seasons are off!
Road accidents take place every day.
Where'd you go skiing?
You've been to the barbershop?
The prospect is depressing.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ball pen.
The only way to find out what happened was to ask Tom.
I didn't sleep for 48 hours.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
Go away.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's all take a picture together.
I failed in my exam.
Everybody already knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
The footballer made a big mistake.
They're coming, too?

That's my cat.
Do you have any kids?

Tom likes them.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a presumptuous idiot.
It keeps me awake at night.
He's been transferred to another department.
I think you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom thinks it's a sin to dump food.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place is bending to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why didn't you talk to Tom about it?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to the church.
Tom wiped the whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's reacting.
That's the sweetest guy I've ever met.
How much was it?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I used to be.
Do you know the boy who's crying?

It's just astonishing.
He said he'd never do it.
The one who steals the pin will steal the cow.
Tom's not a good swimmer, is he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was just a shadow of himself.
How do we do this?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to come with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
Things happen.
What day is it?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to take me the way I am.
I'm just a guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily on the lips?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he was coming with us.
Tom died a day later.

I've only heard the good news of it.
I don't work here anymore.
Which one do you like?
Here's my ticket.
You can't match us.
I saw the car exploded.
The window is here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never dump my Playstation.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
Stay still!
What's your favorite TV show?
You want to go to the movie tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you'll get lost.
I like to go to school.
I offered to help.
I'll go back to Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son for me.
I think her dad's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
The dog is yours.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell Tom I'm gonna go to his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?
I didn't want to disturb him.
The officer put the courage in his men.
Tom will never find her.
Either way, I'm thinking about trying something like this.
I don't know much about hunting.
It's the first time I've ever cooked meat on a grill at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why would they do that?
Tom would have apologised to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
That's what everyone knew.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe that's what she said.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw the way he looked at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom has to be home.
She was who I was thinking about.
Tom showed the cop his driver's license.
I cut my hair every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
This apple is sour.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalog.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.

Have you ever been a soldier?
That's a good idea.
Do you know how to use a computer?
What would you do if tomorrow was the end of the world?
I asked Tom to come with me.
We're interrupting him.
I don't think Tom can be left alone.
Religion won't let me.
As far as I know, he wasn't involved in this scam.
Thomas was killed by lightning.
We don't know what Tom and Mary know.
I want to be happy.
You're gonna get lost.
We've seen it before.
How many pairs of socks have you bought?
We never give up hope.
What happened to the book I put here yesterday?
Not to mention the price, I don't like this dress.
I want to know who started it.
I didn't think I'd be punished.
Write it in a pencil.
We didn't build it.
You'd better go help him.
Is that okay?
They sell tickets to Shakira's concert tomorrow morning.
It was better today.
I know Tom's a brave man.
I got married early.
It's not a bug.
I don't want to frighten you.
Tom told me Mary wouldn't want to go.
Have you talked to the doctors yet?
No one's seen it.
Mary is an outstanding artist.
I think he's right.
Everybody likes money.
They got lost in the woods.
When was the last time you ate?
I have a heartache.
My dad won't let me go to the movie alone.
I saw the boat drown.
Instead of going to work, I've been home all day.
I'll back you up.
I didn't talk to Tom.
They decided to work harder.
It's not for sale.
Who are your neighbors?
My dad usually watches TV after dinner.
He drinks wine.
Please cut off your apple pie.
I don't think Tom understood the question.
You have to stop her.
You'll be on time if you get out now.
There was no particular problem with Tom.
The darkness didn't cover it up.
I invited him to dinner.
I'm sure it'll be easy to find a place.
I took two aspirin tablets from my head.
You're in my heart.
He snagged me to the last penny.
Don't laugh!
Love is not subject to anyone.
If you go to Tom now, you'll probably find him watching TV.
I saw you in the park with Tom.
I didn't mean to offend them.
I'd better go look for them.
My bike broke down on the way.
Tom made a selfie without a shirt.
In whose kingdom was this church built?
We'll be able to put you in jail soon.
I'm starting to think you're serious.
I'm not coming back.
I'm sure Tom would love to help.
It's Joanna.
I've made so many mistakes.
How can people do such things?
So I'm really sorry.
I love your sunglasses.
Rainy water is streaming down this pipe.
I always thought Tom was a close friend.
I'm the kind of girl who's more friends with guys.
Don't worry, I have insurance.
Tom will be here with me.
It's hard for my dad to stop drinking.
No one's suggesting you do it.
He works for this company from Monday to Sunday.
Mary forgot to lock up the car.
I'm old.
Tom left with Mary.
Tom began to laugh.
I'll call Tom tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic powers.
Who is he of national origin?
Tom was in the same cell with John.
I didn't want to swim.
He's been drinking a beer.
Nowadays, it's hard for a man to be... himself.
I'll never talk to him again.
Shh, wake Tom up!
I'll comfort my handkerchiefs.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm the new teacher.
They're all kids.
She got mad and yelled at me.
Did you take your medicine?
The bunnies are very cute.
She doesn't trust him.
Time is on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Is there something you want to tell me?
I don't think Tom's still mad.
You'll be better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell burning rubber?
That's not what happened here.
When's your dad coming home?
I get it.
Tom got Mary a book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of the shower.
Tom's got a patient.
She didn't buy the bread.
Tom and Mary are single.
Tom's gonna try to run.
You're obviously tired.
We're champs.
Tom's suffocating.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring a salad to the party.
Her hair's wet from the sweat.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it weighs?
A flight attendant is a master of compliments.
Tom's married to Mary, right?
All the bench in the park was busy.
Someone needs to tell her.
It's all working out for me.
Vermont is located on the border with Canada.
He had to live in the same room as his brother.
I'm not an imbecile.
You're gonna fix it, right?
I don't know how to hunt.
He has a brother in Tokyo.
The dynamite was invented by Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to step in.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go if you want.
I know you don't have to do this.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my sunglasses.
I've already talked to this student.
What is the chemical symbol for Methyl Hydrogenic Acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
So we need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do it.
That's cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a janitor.
I respect his views, although I do not agree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tie up his sweater.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
Is it cheaper to call after nine?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use it, do you?
How much do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
How long do you plan on staying?
We ate in a hurry and left immediately.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't drop anything on your feet.
Start every meal with the soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What's she whispering to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right in front of me.
The calf was open.
I've got some wine.
I'm not popular.
It's his first day at school.
I'm dying to meet you.
She's pretty, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest another strategy?
They're dead.
The apples are big.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
Is she singing?
I need to go to the toilet.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's take a car.
You're in my way.
She was wondering what his lips would taste like.
A good trainer trains this team.
The tree is sick.
The train was held because of the heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What makes you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is this drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you have eaten?
You don't recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning on doing it.
I'm falling.
I couldn't come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
Last year, she learned how to ride a bike.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Since it was winter, he didn't go out.
Walking down the street, I saw a friend of mine.
How many houses are on your street?
Elephant tusks are made of ivory.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"How's it going, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
Her native language is French.
That coat's not the same.
She stopped for a smoke.
Tom was married at the time.
I bought this book.
Naiveness is his only positive quality.
My hobbies are insect collection.
Tom lived in Boston as a kid.
I haven't eaten in six days.
Can I tell them that?
She's been quiet all day.
No matter what he can say, don't trust him.
I'm moving on.
Tom and Mary hope that their next child will be a boy.
Mary's always very nice, and she's got a nice smile.
I'm not gonna let her die.
In all cultures, babies fall asleep under the lobster.
This is the best restaurant I know.
You could learn a lot from them if you'd just listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
A man who has never left his country is full of prejudice.
It's astonishing how quiet it is when the snow falls.
Tom's helping his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd be back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I turned on my imagination.
I thought we could do it.
My mom didn't want me to go alone.
I'm sorry, I misunderstood you.
You know what you're doing, right?
You can't trust a machine transfer.
She hit me, not him.
You don't get it.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
This river is full of fish.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
She and I are the same age.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had those symptoms?
The prisoner has been released.
What did they say happened?
Could you leave the door open?
That'll have to wait.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my age.
Tom knows what he did was a mistake.
Japan has a soft climate.
Check again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mom finally got home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced a traumatized player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip went very smoothly.
It's inevitable I'll go to France one day, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom's just pretending to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on the tax.
Tom's watching.
It's not raining, we can open the windows again.
I've never been like this before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was gonna go out when the phone rang.
I don't have to take it.
Always give way to the obstruction on the right.
We're being asked to introduce ourselves one at a time.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can give you a ride if you want.
Tom told Mary she wasted her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I've never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot tub.
I don't really have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about it.
You have nothing to be sorry for.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice is like a melodic siren song for me.
What's it like to be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like it.
My fingers left prints on the glass.
Chemistry is a great science.
I feel like my French isn't getting any better.
How am I best able to get a passport?
You may be able to help Tom.
Tom is the best drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom's been ignoring Mary all day.
Tom's got fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he has no choice.
It's still light outside.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
It's my dad's car, but it'll be mine soon.
Did you forget his name?
If I had time to do it, I would.
Do you see Tom's boat?
Is Thomas big?
This medicine will help you.
Stop the fuss.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how busy I was?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I have no one to trust.
She's a fan of Sex in the City.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Be good to him.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you have to do this often?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing like a beer after a long day of work.
What was it?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How long do you need?
Let's take a break here.
Are you wearing new boots?
You can go if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom used to say.
She made a grin when she saw the dog.
He's not any better than me.
Smoking is strictly prohibited.
This peach is beautiful.
Do you see?
Tom doesn't like it.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
Good work!
You used to say it yourself.
Here are a few letters for you.
It is almost inconceivable that a scientist of this level would have made such a fundamental error.
He has no proof.
You don't look well.
He was a very good swimmer when he was young.
I'm texting a friend.
He's very good at tennis.
She misled the students.
She said she was Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And when were you gonna tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I filled up the jar.
Go straight ahead.
I'm too tired to think about it now.
What house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
What do we live for?
Will it rain this afternoon?
We know about her.
You could have helped us.
I don't drive much.
He doesn't like the end of the movie.
Just get inside.
Just ask him for his forgiveness.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm sick of you two.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventure.
Tom's in the library.
Did you go to school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you happy?
I've decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
There's gonna be a big snowfall tomorrow.
We decided to reschedule the meeting to next Sunday.
She thinks she can prove it.
When was the last time you played golf?
Are we poor?
I don't know Tom's name.
We have the same dentist.
Not all Brazilians like carnival.
I don't think Tom knows what's going on.
Who did Tom sell his car to?
Tom's cheating.
I have to make money to be able to buy a computer.
Don't laugh at foreigners.
I don't know them.
If you could pick genes for your kids, would you?
That's why Mary has to rest.
He went to bed.
It could have been worse.
Tom's done his part.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's keys are.
What book are you looking for?
I don't sleep much.
Someday you'll get there.
Tom's good with Mary.
"You owe me money." "No, you don't."
He went up and got on his knees.
You don't have to go if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Did Tom do it for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom earns three times as much as Mary does.
I've been drinking milk.
It's gonna be snowing tomorrow.
Isn't life wonderful?
When it comes to cooking, no one likes Mary.
You haven't been yourself lately.
Tom lost his leg in a shark attack.
I baked it for you.
We'll do it as soon as we have time.
Next year, I'll be three times your age.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your stamp collection.
It'll take forever.
Tom's not much taller than Mary.
He doesn't seem to know.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
It's the fabric that's messing with your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's winter soon.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to.
Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up a professional guitar game.
I'm married now.
It was just a few times.
You've gone too far this time.
It's working.
Are you going to see Tom before you go?
"No wonder," replied Tom.
We want to rent an apartment in the city.
They spoke French.
It's very expensive.
He's not singing anymore.
I didn't know what else to do.
They still haven't woken up.
Tom's a couple inches above Mary.
I'm glad you offered.
Your question is hard to answer.
You don't believe her?
English is a world language.
Sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told Tom to leave Mary alone.
You didn't know Tom was in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for a job.
Why would Tom need a hammer?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
Things are getting worse.
I'm gonna pick a place to eat.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new car.
I just wanted to say good luck to you.
She's undressed.
I'm not gonna let you take my kids.
Don't give it to him.
Run or you'll be arrested.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom made it a rule to meditate every morning.
Did you check your calculations?
He tried to make up a short story.
A room without books, like a body without a soul.
Why has God offended us so much?
What does your brother do?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you in years.
I went to see Tony last night.
She's easy to impress.
You're old enough to do it on your own.
Aristotle thought the Earth was the center of the universe.
I wonder what Tom really meant.
No one understands me.
There are so many stars in the sky, I can't count them.
Everybody turn around and look at us.
Let me see.
The polar bears live in the Arctic.
I told you I was the best.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
You don't have to ask Tom to do anything a few times.
Let's get the dishes cleaned today by the one who loses the stone-scissors-papier!
How bad I am!
I would never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He's fluent in Russian -- at least that's what he told me.
Tom's a third-year student.
How long are you gonna stay?
I'm not a woman.
She has a tall dad.
The train was full.
The house is red.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
You know Boston well, don't you?
The Orchestra has begun to play.
Mary was in a pirate suit.
She's not my wife.
Why didn't you mention it earlier?
Tom didn't want to be a snitch.
He was born at 7 a.m. on June 5, 1970.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are twins.
Tom only eats white meat.
Thank you for your help.
We only have three rules.
She bought one for herself.
Security didn't see Tom.
In recent years, Tom has become quite obsessive.
I helped move those bags.
They've got plenty of time.
Fifteen by five is seventy-five.
I live in this hotel.
I don't want to know any more.
You don't know what he's gonna say.
My arms are tired.
I've been lying to my wife all the time.
Finally, she succeeded.
It's an outrage that they weren't immune to the fire.
We have a lot of money.
The test was split into two parts.
When are you gonna tell them?
Tom didn't want to talk about his illness.
Ah, it's so boring here!
Reading a book is like a journey.
Tom saw Mary go into the shop.
Why aren't you there?
Tom said Mary would probably win.
A Japanese would never do that.
I miss Boston so much.
She writes letters all the time.
I don't know who to consult.
Turn left on the corner.
Tom taught me to do it.
We can do a lot more.
Give me one, please.
I can't stand bad kids.
Tom bought it for me.
What you said made everyone mad.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for 30 years.
She's shown her talents.
I wish it was possible.
I'm guessing you can't do it.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
At the next school festival, Bob will play the main role for the first time.
You have to stay in shape.
I've been scavenging seed all day.
The accent made me think he was American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was it a joke?
Have mercy!
Tom obeyed.
All the people of my generation think about it the same.
I live for it.
Do you know how to ski?
The Duke owns a lot of land.
At least we had fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's getting better.
You're gonna feel like you're at home.
It's not gonna end well!
He looked like he hadn't eaten in days.
I didn't ask you to go.
"Who's Norman Finkelstein?" "American politicologist."
Get out of here!
So what is this, I'm curious, if it's not a house sale, then maybe it's a new way to get to know the girls?
Tom picked up a coin.
Why didn't you clean up your room?
If there is no God, everything is allowed.
We're both Mary.
I knew I needed to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please fasten your seatbelts during takeoff and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both like seafood.
I've been waiting a long time for this.
I turned down the offer.
Do you want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
It's gonna take me too long to explain why this isn't gonna work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build all of this yourself?
I look forward to my summer vacation.
Can we put it a different way?
It looks good from here.
Wooden houses are inflammable.
Let's throw Tom a party.
The dog's still alive.
I go to university.
I know you lied.
The bed is very comfortable.
I'll make a report on it tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a slut.
I want to listen to your side.
I'll wait here for him to come.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know Mary's shoe size.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is Jose, we're friends.
You forgot to mention it.
We don't need this anymore.
Can I get something to eat?
Tom can do it without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who set up the meeting?
I'm such a bad guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not gonna have fun tonight, I have to get ready for class.
Mary was the only girl in a skirt.
What kind of bird can't fly?
This has to stop.
Tom didn't answer right away.
Tom died at the age of 70.
Life is a gift.
Tom speaks French.
The invention of the transistor marked a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.
Did you hear what she said about Alexei?
You look like a girl.
Here are a few photos.
What's on Channel 10?
I hate spinach.
Mother's making lunch.
Tom's a pilgrim.
What can I do?
Her son's a genius.
I know you've seen terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He tends to let his emotions go.
We were appalled by the news of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I didn't see you.
You're just saying the obvious.
He had cancer.
It's your own fault that this happened.
It's as accurate as a watch.
I know where you're going.
You're catching up on it.
Let's move it.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he's telling us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do it.
I don't like doing this.
The janitor cut off the conversation.
There's a cat on the table.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're not limping anymore.
Tom was a big smoker.
Tom's wearing his glove.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to this weather.
I was wondering who would help him decorate the snowman?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in soul mates?
What's that noise?
My son has a hereditary disease.
It's disgusting.
Is it snow?
I'll call you back.
He put the window down.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can get married to your dog.
The best defense is an attack.
She's getting married this fall.
I'm sorry, I don't get it.
I thought it'd be easier.
Is there anything we can do to help you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When will you be ready to go?
The investigations began last year with the confiscation of the computer files of a man from the German city of Magdeburg.
How are you?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
Why do you think you can't?
We were on our way back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe this?
Thank you for your correction.
Are you crazy?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get this scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom's getting his pencil.
Tom can't ride a bike.
I don't talk to the body at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why would you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much money do you need?
Mary laughed to tears.
I spent $500 in one day.
Tell them to go home.
Put it anywhere.
They didn't make it on time.
It's 7:30.
I see you're up.
I want to know who told Tom.
Tom got up early to see the sunrise.
The Dinosauriers have been extinct a long time ago.
I usually go up the stairs in one.
Tom's had a year.
I'm at the station.
Tom's a very good boy.
You're drinking?
You're from Boston, right?
Put it on my desk.
Tom got out of the water.
I was very proud of it.
You were ready.
Do you know Tom's brother?
All lizards can lay their eggs.
You'll pay for what you've done.
I'm getting it all out of my hand today.
I told them to stay out of it.
Tom didn't know how to drive until he was 30.
I'm glad he didn't get hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
The kitchen knife wasn't sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my pen knife.
Sweetheart, I can explain.
You'll soon adapt to the country life.
Keep a bucket of water next to you.
You're not a kid anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We all got along.
