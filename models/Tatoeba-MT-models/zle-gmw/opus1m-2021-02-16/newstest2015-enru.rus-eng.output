India also reportedly looks forward to an agreement on defence cooperation between the two States.
The Russian Federation FANO will hold a final expert session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia), together with RNA, will hold the third expert session “Assessing the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations”.
The meeting will be final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, and it is reported in a press release to Lenta.Rue.
At the third meeting, it is planned to take stock of the work of the Expert Session during the year and to develop a final list of indicators to assess the performance of scientific organizations.
Individual participants plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for evaluating the work of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting assessments.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to establish a unified approach for all three academies to the methodology for assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have been able to do so, and the final version of the normative instruments is being negotiated.
As a result of the next session, we must complete the process of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the assessment”, said Elena Axenova, head of the expert analysis department of the Russian FANO.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than 100 scientific institutions in Russia.
As a result, a resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on 16 September 2014, at 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars.
Astrophysics from the University of California in Santa Cruz studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
The discovery of specialists is expected to make it possible to search for relatives among the stars, i.e. from one cluster.
The results of their studies were published in Nature magazine and are available briefly on the University's website.
The reason for the same chemical composition of the nearest stars is turbulent mixing in the clouds of gas prior to the formation of the stars.
Even if a born star then leaves the star cluster, the chemical composition of the star can determine its birthplace and the region of birth.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
Simulation results from astrophysics show that such differences should not occur.
In their research, experts modelled two interstellar gas streams that together formed a cloud.
This object, for several million years under its own gravity, is transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added tags to the initial gas streams and found that rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud achieved a high degree of chemical homogeneity.
Astrophysics believe that their research proves that it is possible to search for chemically related stars and to identify possible regions of formation of such objects.
Carrata police arrested a 20-year-old after chasing a motorcycle at high speed.
The motorcycle was confiscated after being driven at 125 km/h in the area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and across the bushland to escape the Pilbar police.
A transport police patrol in Carrata tried to stop the blue motorcycle this morning, discovering that it had a speed of 125 km/h when it left the service station at Batgate Road.
The police report that the motorcyclist did not stop and continued his movement on Burgess Road, then retreated into the bushland, leaving the police out of sight.
The motorcycle and the driver's description were seen near the Wallcott Way house in Bulgarra.
Carrata police charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and driving dangerously.
He is to be brought before the Carrata Court of Justice on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.

Lavrov: Russia will not "knock the door" in connection with new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not “clap the door” in connection with the new sanctions.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergey Lavrov, announced this today, speaking to the students and teachers of the MGIMO.
With regard to our response to a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything must be specifically calculated,' he said.
And when we figure out what European and American partners are going to do this time, then we're going to decide how to respond.
This will not involve slaming doors, some sort of resentment, misunderstood, the Minister stressed.
First of all, we will move away from our interests, our interests to protect our economies, our social sphere, our citizens, our businesses and draw conclusions from the actions of partners to ensure their adequacy, contractual capacity and reliability.
The steps taken in the area of sanctions can be very well assessed by the partners, as continued by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
If the whole voice says "they'll be painful for us, too, but we have to do it to punish Russia," it's probably not very appropriate."
With regard to WTO, the withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, no.
On the other hand, we want to learn more about WTO instruments, including when it comes to trade disputes, Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome what we believe is the EU’s discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of dumping, while anti-dumping measures are being applied against Russian economic sectors.
“We are ready to engage in the WTO mechanisms and to defend our position that the EU third energy package should not be applied retrospectively”, said Lavrov.
How do you use the siren properly in the design of the garden?
Irina Okuneva answers the questions:
Since the siren loses its main attraction after blooming, it is desirable that it be planted along with other bushes.
It fits perfectly with many cultures.
And you can and should plant both plants that are decorative at different times and bloom at the same time.
Another plus sireny is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a tree of different heights, an improved bush, a bush with a wide base, and even a garden bonsai, a tree with a bizarrely curved stem.
Just choose the form that's more consistent with the design of your garden.
In Karelia, a resident of Leningrad oblast was convicted of selling counterfeit money.
According to the national Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was involved in his criminal activities in the Olonetsk and Segezh districts.
In addition to Karelia, he has committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already inherited from the Vologd region, where he was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment in the spring of this year.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonets District Court.
And to complete the investigation into crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Ségejo.
In the course of the investigation, the guilt was proved for several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money in the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the criminal case file with an indictment was sent to court.
On Friday, 29 August, the court decided to commute the sentence of imprisonment to four years in a general-regime colony.
The sentence did not enter into force.
Let's remind you, last week, two other counterfeit money dealers were convicted of paying in Petrozavodsk's stores.
The citizens of Azerbaijan also came from St. Petersburg to Karelia.
One of them is imprisoned for five years and the other for four years.
Each one has a fine of 500,000 rubles.
The sentence has also not yet entered into force.
Archangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy, "Dervish."
The meeting, which took place at the regional centre, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
The Durvish delivered military assistance from the United States and the United Kingdom to the USSR.
In Archangelsk, a memorial rally was held at the site of a future monument to the northern convoys, located on the riverside name of Sedov in Solombal.
The event brought together representatives of the Veteran organizations of Archangelsk, children from the cadets class.
For the first time, we met twenty-three years ago when the mortgage stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who have not been returned by the sea,” noted Boris Karpov, chairman of the Council of Veterans of the North Sea Shipping.
Then the town’s perfume orchestra played the event, and the cadets gave the veterans flowers and marched with Russia’s flags and the banner of victory.
The meeting ended with the placing of flowers on a mortgage stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategic raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of uniform boots, tin, wool, and many other equipment).
In addition, military equipment and weapons - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, 15 Harrikane fighter aircraft - were on board.
At the same time, the escort of the convoy consisted of 16 British Navy ships, including two carriers.
The ship's caravan was not found by the enemy and reached its destination, Archangelska.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 transport vessels and about 50 military vessels were killed.

Recalling the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights.
Congressmen Keith Allison and John Lewis proposed a bill under which trade union organization is protected as civil law.
"Where trade unions are, there are middle-class jobs," says Allison, the Minnesota Democrat, who is the co-chair of the Progressive Fracture Congress.
That's why I'm proud to introduce the Employee Empowerment Act along with the symbol of the John Lewis Civil Rights Movement.
This innovative bill will provide workers with the same legal opportunities to discriminate against trade union organizations as other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of trade union opponents
Amendment of the Labour Relations Regulation Act to allow workers who face discrimination for participating in trade union organizations to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and fines - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative — at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis and the drafters are proposing is to remember a very American idea.
Despite the attacks on trade unions in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country — Americans once supported countries around the world in accepting, expanding and respecting labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when that country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his associates helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to guarantee that Hideki Todjo’s paramilitary autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in shaping a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the workers' right to organize, to negotiate and to act collectively is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his associates helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler’s fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that openly stated: “The right to form associations to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to everyone and to every profession or activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will not have legal effect; measures to that end will be considered illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights, which will be adopted by the United Nations as a world agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to defend their interests”.
In generations, Americans have accepted as due a basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and to participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government institutions - should be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago,
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the forces of the nation, but has increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised an entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how it should be for us.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the expansion of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - was long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis are reviving ideals that historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge is temporarily blocking a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the U.S., a federal judge temporarily blocked the enactment of the Louisiana Act on Sunday, about which his supporters say that he is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana, Bobby Ginadl, in June, and was to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who perform abortions would have been required to receive patients in the hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision meant that doctors could continue to perform legal abortions for the time being by continuing to seek such authority.
"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing to exercise authority," wrote Judge John de Gravells in his judgement.
The hearing will be scheduled within the month at which the judge will render a more permanent ruling on the law.
Advocates of the right to abortion were happy to meet this decision, the last in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital authority.
“Today's decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from an insidious law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights”, said Nancy Northap, President and Head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who filed a lawsuit against the law on behalf of three out of five state clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who did not file a complaint in the case and also applied for admission.
Louisiana is part of the 11 states that have enacted such laws, and the courts have recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by the federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that admissions laws impose medical restrictions that are not necessary in medical terms.
Opponents of abortion object that such measures were aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has the power to receive a hospital, informed the Center for Reproductive Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state were to stop doing this procedure, this doctor, fearing for his safety, would have stopped doing it, the group reported.
Criticizing that decision, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish abortion doctors while their applications for admission were pending.
The result of the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each product in the range of trading networks should be Russian, and Oleg Nilov, a deputy of the State Duma from the Fair Russia faction, considers them to be Russian.
The Parliamentarian drafted a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writing in the newspaper Izvestia.
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This is the case for goods that are not produced in Russia; for the rest of the products produced in Russia, the Riteiler will have to provide at least half of its shelf to domestic producers,” reported the Niles to the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article “On the basis of State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation”, the draft law provides for the amendment of the Tax Code, which establishes a lower VAT rate of 10 per cent for the marketing of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50 per cent quota in trade networks is part of a stimulus package for Russian producers.
There will be several times more domestic goods on the counters.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, according to experts.
According to the lawyer of Taxnik, a member of the independent expert centre “Public Duma”, Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect would be positive and would lead to growth.
The plus will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They'll be able to sell more, which means the profits will increase.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices to the Ritellers, as they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, leading to higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, and some industries will start expanding, some will become more self-sustaining, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia’s dependence on foreign food will decline several times, but not immediately,” the expert notes.
In the past, Russian enterprises were often unable to access local shops because of high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now that the embargo has been imposed, this niche has been freed and can be breathed with relief.
But let us not forget that, after all the necessary agreements and sanitary checks, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will flow into the Russian market.
In other words, now is the moment of calm, when the former players have already left and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, the increasing demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the rising prices of finished products,” explained Aif.ru, the first Vice-President of the Russian public organization, the Russian Financial Directors' Club, Tamara Kasianova.
It is clear that the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category will help to secure the sector for local producers.
In such a case, they would compete with each other rather than with goods that, through subsidies from another State, were cheaper.
In other words, the fight for the buyer will be waged between companies operating under the same industry law.
On the other hand, Kasianova notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of compatriots by far not all articles.
And in this situation, trade networks will have to stretch the share of Russian goods to half the range.
As a result, there is a growing fear that poor products will be brought to the counters.
Perhaps foreign products with broken labels will be supplied under the guise of being produced in Russia,” the expert adds.
The negative effects of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that benefit from cooperation with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will suffer as demand for their products declines.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods may also affect consumers.
The fact is that some Russian products may give way to import analogues, while shops may be able to push prices for second products like scarce goods.
The idea of import-immunization, which was forgotten in the early 2000s, was again mentioned by economists in February this year because of the continued devaluation of the ruble.
Now, in the face of difficult relations with the West, the issue of non-importing products is becoming even more urgent.
The Act is designed to require retailers to treat suppliers with domestic producers when ordering them.
Then we will move much faster and more confidently along the path of importation, and the production planning system for the required products will be developed in a shorter time frame,” says MP Oleg Neilov.
A particularly effective quota mechanism would be for those agricultural sectors where capacity was particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where imports accounted for 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really capable of covering the Russian shop counters completely.
In addition, meat production can also have a strong impulse.
As is known, the largest share of imports is maintained for beef, ranging from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
So 65-70% of the product is still Russian,” Kasyanova reasoned.
The experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will contribute to and may accelerate the import of domestic products.
However, this initiative will not in itself lead to import, as it requires a set of measures, I believe Litvinenko.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under the initiative could still be imported from abroad, which meant that no full import would occur, but significant steps would be taken in that direction.
Moreover, it was not enough to establish quotas, and there was still a need for domestic product production in the country to meet those quotas.
These quotas will provide such guarantees,” the expert notes.
Late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of the memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Rural Australian women face a higher risk of ovarian cancer deaths than urban women.
Researchers analysed disease maps for over 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35% lived five years after the diagnosis.
The lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute of Medical Research reported that the probability of dying during the study is 20 per cent higher for those living in regions and remote areas of the state than for those living in urban areas.
A LITTLE STUDY: New drugs can slow lung cancer and ovarian cancer
Researchers have tracked the women’s medical path in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the woman's age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the existence of current diseases and socio-economic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside cities were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecological oncology, and they are mostly in large cities," she said.
Despite improvements in the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of out-of-area services that would allow specialists to treat women closer to home and support programmes for people who were being treated far from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that the longevity of women with ovarian cancer was rare, emphasizing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Chancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Coast, Elisha Nive, said she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open the door in the Kujener district.
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktybelik was started in April of this year and was based on a model project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million roubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of Chapter Mary El, funding for the construction of the facility was financed from the national budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the facility under construction is almost 230 square metres.
Health care will be provided to the inhabitants of eight localities: the villages of Toktaybeliac and the villages of Dementievo, Püncheryumal, Tuña, Fomichi, Toraybelyak, Shinur and Chaskaal.
The new midwifery post would replace the existing FAP, whose building had been built in 1918 and had long been exhausted and its premises were not adequate for sanitation.
The new institution will be opened shortly.
The killer of a four-month-old son in a drunken state will be brought to justice.
Chuvashi's resident will be on the bench for the murder of her own child.
In Ceboxasara, the criminal case of a 31-year-old resident of Novohochehkossarsk, accused of causing death by negligence, has been completed.
The investigation found that, on 26 July this year, the accused, together with her four-month-old son, had come to celebrate the birth of the child of the Kuma in Ceboxara.
After a long table, she decided to stay and put the baby to bed.
When the baby woke up and cried at night, a drunken woman put him on her bed next to her to feed her breasts, but she soon fell asleep.
During her sleep, a woman fell on her son, causing him to die of asphyxiation.
The criminal case, reported by the U.S. Press Service of the U.S.C. for Chuvashia, has been brought to court.
Inflation's out of vacation.
Will Russians Feel the Rising Prices
As a result of the Russian Federation's and the West's cross sanctions, inflation in Russia will accelerate and fall short of the authorities' predictions, convinced by the analysts of BTB Capital.
According to experts, the delayed effects of the anti-sanctions will lead to inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, writing by RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast by the Ministry of Economic Development, inflation in 2014 would be 6.5 to 7.5 per cent, down from 6.5 per cent in the following year.
However, according to the Summersant newspaper, this week the MEA is expected to make “small but principled” adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency could lower the estimate of inflation for 2015, which would eliminate the expected loss of income growth.
The forecast assumed that Russian food sanctions were in force for a year until August 2015.
How could such high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation implies a one-time shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change," said the newspaper’s source in Minfin.
The BTB Capital economists do not share the Government's financial and economic expectations for inflation and forecast a price increase of 8 per cent in 2014.
Experts are convinced that the main effect of food bans will be combined with the possible introduction of a sales tax (SL tax) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015.
Inflation peaks of 9% will take place in February, followed by annual price increases, according to experts.
By the way, last week, Rosstat summed up the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation imposed “soft sanctions”.
Aif.ru interviewed the experts and found out their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deyev, Head of the Analysis Department of FC AForex:
Prices are already rising for major segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially important products began to be valued, the Government was forced to initiate systematic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unjustified price increases in the short term.
Vendors and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators to ensure that the authorities know exactly who, when and why the price increases are initiated.
The key factors for the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the huge capital outflow, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, and the embargo on the import of food products from countries that have acceded to the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressure were to remain under control, the cost of the basket of a minimum set of products would not increase by 12% in a quarter alone.
The ban on the import of food products has caused a supply shock on the domestic market and has led to a perfectly logical increase in the final cost.
As we are currently unable to fully launch the import-immunization mechanism, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the sanctions will continue to bear the risks of inflationary growth.
By the end of this year, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent if the fiscal reasons for the lack of confidence in the national currency and the declining prospects for economic growth are added.
Alexander Razuwaev, Director of the Analysis Department of Alpari
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30 per cent per month, at zeros was also above the current level, another thing that was offset by rapid economic growth.
I think the year's inflation will be 8-8.5 per cent.
Maguta Plateau, Asset Manager of the UK Maguta Foundation
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is being successfully restrained so far, but if there is a further increase in pressure, especially on the financial sector, it can lead to certain difficulties and increase the inflationary expectations of the population, which have traditionally been reflected in the purchase of cash currency in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the Government, the Russian Federation CB and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble by both market methods and government regulation.
But price increases begin traditionally after summer calm and may become more visible this fall.
Russia’s consumer inflation target of 7.5 per cent is likely to stand, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
The horticultural centres are saddened by the decline in the number of homeowners
This decline, due to the exceptional decline in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, may cause horticultural centres to lose tens of millions of pounds a year when today’s young consumers reach the “primary age of horticulture”, according to a study by HTA reported by the Financial Times.
According to the report, renters spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount spent on horticulture by homeowners.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting yards in front of the parking house, and the reduction of the size of the garden as other factors threatening an industry whose annual sales are estimated at £5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, Britain’s lowest spending on gardening goods per household.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society reported that renting housing and lack of garden space do not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief gardening adviser at RHS, said, "Popling in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden age” of retail trade in horticulture products as a result of an increase in homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year because of better weather after adverse conditions last March and April.

Lausanne Vasilev took his place.
It turns out that two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund were changed quietly on Friday.
The Deputy Executive Director, Tatiana Angelova, who had been responsible for State aid and the SAPARD programme, has been released and reports to BGNES with reference to the newspaper Trudd.
I didn't attend the fund's board because by law we weren't management members, but I was told later that I was released.
I can't tell you why my resignation is not reported on the Foundation's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I know more on Monday," said Angelov.
Ivanka Bagatov, who was still the head of Investment Credit at the central foundation at Landdelia in Sofia, will take her place.
The Deputy Executive Director, Nikolai Dachev, was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for the fields paid by the EU.
Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the Regional Directorate of the Landdelia Foundation, will be appointed to his seat until January 2014.
Only the Deputy Chief of the Atije Foundation, Alieva Veli, retained her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the agency are not mentioned.
Turkey summons an American diplomat to report espionage.
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent reported that the American Chargé d'affaires and Turkish officials had discussed the communication on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former US National Security Analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence facility for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey underestimated the importance of this report, saying that all leading countries were spying on each other.
Earlier reports that the German General Intelligence Agency has also made Ankara a target of intelligence have provoked a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
The biggest Chinese companies joined against Alibaba
Chinese companies, among which the largest Chinese real estate developer, Dalian Wanda Group, and Tencent Holdings (Society, Massenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trade with Alibaba.
But catching up on the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which even left behind its American rivals, eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Union of Major
Companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in a joint venture, 70 per cent will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent to each of the Internet companies, says Wanda Group.
It is planned to register the firm in Hong Kong.
The SP will combine Baidu search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China with about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 fair hotels, Wanda manages at least 49 commercial real estate sites across China and 40 shopping centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (over $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and a theme park in Qindao (a city in eastern China on the shore of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors per year and generate a profit of $960 million per year.
In addition, Wanda owns the American AMC Entertainment Holdings cinema network, making the company the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda is planning to equip all its shopping centres, hotels and entertainment places with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the newly created rival Alibaba.
According to Dong Tze, who will lead the new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new site should be the world's largest platform online-to-offline, notes Dong Cet.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) is to attract customers on the Internet to go to regular offline shops or to buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the sale of coupons such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest "bird" in online commerce," said Van Jianglin, head of Wanda (Bloomberg quote).
"Now there is no real O2O site in China, and in this situation everyone's chances are roughly equal," he says.
China's Internet market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will increase to $395 billion more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, bringing official statistics to Bloomberg: this is more than the population of any country in the world except India.
And it is projected that by 2015, this number could increase to 850 million.
Union of the Rich
The head of Tencent Ma Huaten was until recently the richest man in China, but according to the Bloomberg millionaire index, the founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, has already surpassed it by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his share in Alibaba.
The Baidu leader, Robin Lee, is now ranked third among China's richest people, while Wang Jianlin of Wanda is number four.
"It's very interesting to see that the three richest people are working together to challenge the even richer," said Bloomberg, director of the Chinese e-commerce research centre in Hangzhou Tzao Lai.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to compete seriously with Aliba right after its creation: "Rome can't be built in one day."
The fact that it is not easy to compete with Alibaba not only with new companies but also with well-deserved leaders of the world's Internet trade is evidenced by the report published the previous day on the financial performance of Alibaba over the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as the middle of eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than its two American competitors combined.
Alibaba's net profits over the period are almost double the sum of the same competitors - they grew almost three times in annual terms to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has great potential to generate money, largely thanks to its mobile applications," commented Bloomberg's Analyst from Hong Kong's Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba brochure on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website, the company's active mobile service users in July amounted to 188 million, well above the March 163 million.
However, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions in the past quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba has to name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the company can be valued at $187 billion after the stock sale.
According to Bloomberg, Aliba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could be held on September 16.
The Road-show company that preceded this event will start on September 3.
It is expected that Alibaba's release to the IPO will be record in NYSE's history and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
So far, the US stock market record has been the Visa payment system, which in 2008 hosted its shares first, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in the trading networks must be produced by Russia, and the deputies of the State Duma consider them to be Russian.
They drafted a bill on the subject.
These are amendments to article 8 of the Federal Code on the Principles Governing Trade Activities in the Russian Federation and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, of at least 50 per cent of domestic products produced in shops should be for each product.
However, the document will take into account that there are products that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in winter, so they will be given a discount to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a lower VAT rate of 10 per cent for the sale of all foodstuffs originating in Russia, and reports the newspaper Izvestia.
On 27 August, a draft law was submitted to the Lower House of Parliament to amend the FZ “On Retail Markets”, which proposes to revive farmers' markets in Russia where small producers will be able to sell their products.
Chief of Police Magalufa is charged with corruption
The complainants submitted evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the State Attorney of Malorca on Friday.
The Chief of Police of Calvia on the Malorca resort island was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the scandalous Mafalufe’s unbridled drinking centre.
The Chief Inspector, José Antonio Navarro, was detained as a result of allegations of corruption brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the daily online Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the Malorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard on charges of corruption and will be interrogated by the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that the disgruntled owners of nightclubs said that protectionism by the authorities seriously affected their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about surviving," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Our livelihoods cannot be jeopardized.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was hit in the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British vacationer blowing 24 men in a bar race.
The island ' s authorities have since tried to stop drunken hooliganism among the resters of Magaluf, minimizing the number of scandalous alcohol races in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where the blowjob incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and Carnage bar organizers together were fined Y55,000 ($73,000).
Magaluf Tourist resort, mostly popular among young British vacationers, was also the scene of numerous alcohol-intoxicated accidents associated with the crazy fun known as "balconing" when people jump from one balcony to the other or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
WEEKS prepared a cold surprise in South Australia, bringing torrential rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm rain fell on the city by 9:00 p.m., followed by 6.6 mm, which fell in the night of Sunday.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short rains with a violent wind, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and poured almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter released an early portion of the spring last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8C in the city.
Scavenging conditions are believed to have contributed to the delay in landing Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land immediately after 7:30 p.m., but entered the wind shift zone -- a sudden change of speed or short-range wind direction -- and was forced to climb altitude.
The wind surges reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to rise during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is predicted in Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two rains.
The costing of the construction facilities in the Russian Federation will be recalculated
The issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as the problems of network connectivity, are subject to special control by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
The FAS has established an expert council for the promotion of competition in the construction sector.
At its meeting, Vadim Solovyev, head of the FAC Control, Construction and Natural Resources Office, stated that “the current calculation of construction estimates is completely unclear”.
The regulatory framework renders pricing opaque and can lead to an unreasonable construction price, considered by the FAS.
And they propose the cost of building public facilities at the design stage to determine, on the basis of market prices, the design solutions instead of the estimates currently used and the single costs of technology operations.
These proposals are included in the road map and are currently under consideration in the ministro.
“Replacing traditional construction estimates with design calculations should lead to less corruption in the industry,” explains Vadim Solovyev's WGB.
Because the estimates now calculate each bolt and hook, and it is not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes in the documentation, unfaithful construction companies can bury “target tractors”.
I agree with the FAS in the ministro.
“The first work on costing for design elements is already available: methodologies have been developed to calculate prices for design solutions, estimates for these indicators,” the head of the Department of Urban Planning and the Mining Architecture, Elena Zhukova, told RGB.
Road construction has been selected as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
According to RGB, the head of the Pro-Invest construction company, Anatoly Demianco, has long been out of date, but no other business mechanism has yet been proposed.
“As far as the proposed calculations for design elements are concerned, this is difficult to achieve in practice, as construction of buildings often uses very different technologies”, he considers.
It's no secret that the construction market is developing in large part thanks to government order.
According to the Chairman of the NP “Expert Community of Professionals of State Order”, Catherine Lezina, today the State is the most solvent employer.
The Deputy Director of Engineering of the Rosatom Branch Capital Construction Centre, Vladimir Malakhov, pointed out that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to the portfolio of contracts and companies that have monopoly competences and do not allow competitors to compete.
He believed that a transparent market could be created only if access to contracts was maximized from someone ' s influence.
On the Council of Experts, it was suggested that a system of public order should be established in such a way that the same performer could not receive more than one contract of more than 1 billion roubles or several contracts of more than 1 billion roubles.
The Minster believes that this approach needs to be assessed in terms of business impact as well as efficiency in building management.
As Elena Zhukov explained, in this case the employer would need to be assigned the role of the contractor, which would result in an increase in the client ' s staffing and budget costs for its maintenance.
In doing so, the customer ' s expertise will need to be able to assess the quality and safety of the work performed by the contracting organizations.
Often, such a breakdown will need to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the diversion of highly qualified public procurement agents due to a lack of interest in obtaining a public order for part-time work and a small amount of contract.
The Deputy Heads of the Procurement Institute ' s Expert Advisory Centre, Alexander Eustashenkov, believes that the State-ordered procedure has now become a business game for the contractor ' s attention.
And he gave the following example: “A participant, when completing an application, should indicate `specific indicators' without specifying the words: `or equivalent', `must be', `from', `more', `less', `approach', `or', `similar', `not below', `above', `may', `may', `may', `be', `not earlier', `not above', `not allowed' etc.
Thus, clients often abuse their right to prescribe the content requirements of an application submitted by contracting organizations.
Another problem for 44-FZ, in the view of Eustaschenkov, was the need to assess the quality of work at the application stage through the participant's paper proposal.
When considering the participant's application, it is only the contractor's qualifications that can be assessed, but not the quality of the work that has not even begun, the expert suggests.
The quality of the work can only be assessed when it is accepted.
The expert board also proposed that the margin income from the upper to the lower echelon should be transferred so that intermediate contractors would disappear.
The Chairman of the Council of Experts, the State Secretary, the Deputy Head of FAS, Andrey Czarikovsky believes that this should not be done because the contractor must be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, like the famous Arcadia Rykin "Athele" reprisal, "do you have a problem with buttons?"
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed while the Territory was recovering from fighting.
The beginning of school was a source of joy and excitement to the rocket-affected settlements of southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, the Pashos kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed traces of fragments from the walls and rollers before the students arrived.
"We're a little afraid, but we're happy to look into the future," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to get back to a normal life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that suddenly she started going back to school "a little weird."
"It was a difficult time, and we didn't leave our homes at all," she said.
President Reven Rivlin visited Kibbutz, located near the Gaza border, to express his support.
Before the ceasefire stopped the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements, such as Saad, did not enter the streets or left their homes, leaving the Gaza Strip for safer areas to escape from rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, settlements near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which had made a great effort from Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study carefully and said, "We will do our best to give you knowledge and to ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately put an end to the fighting, but key issues remained unresolved, such as the Hamas demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade on Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of the two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of proximity talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, as estimated by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel contests these figures and contends that at least half of those killed were militants; however, it did not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.
Sixty-six soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed on the Israeli side.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gazan militants fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip had been damaged and destroyed, and it was estimated that 250,000 people had taken refuge in more than 100 schools, which had been converted into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, education officials postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon open so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in a school in Gaza.
According to popular criteria, real estate prices have shown the greatest winter growth in seven years.
The housing price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, reporting RP data on Monday.
This increase resulted in a combined 4.2 per cent increase in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than twice as high as 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
The RP Data Research Director, Tim Lawless, reported that Sydney and Melbourne are operating a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that housing prices in Sydney have risen by 16.1 per cent over the past year, compared with 11.7 per cent in Melbourne.
The next most powerful markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices averaged between 5 and 6 per cent.
Canberra was at the other end of the scale, with government spending cuts, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of real estate properties placed for sale over the next few months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Bearing in mind the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high speed of sales and the current conditions with low interest rates, it is likely that the cost of housing will increase in the next three months”, he said.
How people live in the oldest house of Ufa
In the former home of the gold and mining industry, Yevdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (formerly the Greater Kazan) 18 apartments.
The 18th - century house has not changed much since the construction, except for the old age.
Foreigners come here as a tour, and residents suffer more than they rejoice, from their privilege of living in the oldest Ufi house, whose walls remember General Alexander Suvorov.
The date of the building is inaccurate, and historians point to two dates, 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out the building is 300 years old.
Old courtyard, always open door, violin staircase.
The doors to the apartments are close to each other, the walls are cracked, and the street is visible in the glare of the plastered plaster.
I think it's all about being honest.
And the locals say, "You don't think that's true."
Living in a wooden house in the 18th century is very difficult, says Tatiana Lukianova, a resident of apartment number 3.
The subject is on the State Guard, but the money for its maintenance has not been spent for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have simply forgotten.
Last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still clinging thinly, but the foundations are rotten.
Many residents still go to the toilet outside and bathe once a week in a public bath.
How can you be satisfied in such circumstances?
The road goes right under the windows, there's not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana's moving the curtain.
Now you can see what you've only heard before: there's a flow of cars under the windows.
You see, the glass's dizzy all the time, we can't open the windows, but we're used to noise.
Man gets used to everything, to good and bad.
Our apartment is still fine, thanks to his husband, his hands are gold.
Besides, we have two rooms, living together with the three of us.
And other families have much worse conditions, and the ceilings on the second floor are a little over a foot tall.
To contrast, Tatiana offers to visit a neighbor from apartment No. 6, Ludmile Old One.
A nice, hospitable woman from the door offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a single-room apartment, 14.5 m2 per four people, and we live with my husband and my daughter and my granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been another area, and Ludmila's eyeballing the room: antressoli, two sofas with the letter "g"; on one of them a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very close and little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical."
But the ceiling is flowing regularly, and the water system is not good.
Ludmila speaks of her apartment as usual and astonishing at the same time as an Italian woman whose home is on Roman ruins.
I mean, it's one very old and recent, everyday and legendary thing:
The water pipeline was carried out about 40 years ago during the last repairs.
At the same time, we were made a little kitchen in a corner and a toilet from the former closet.
We live just where Demidov and his family lived, and there were servants on the second floor.
Our apartment isn't privatized, and why?
At the Ufa Real Estate Center, they say privatization doesn't matter.
We'll only get a single-room apartment anyway, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, they promised to displace us, but it didn't go any further.
I'm not used to complaining, and I'm not gonna complain.
In this apartment (room!), there was a whole dynasty: my grandparents, my parents, my husband and my daughter and my granddaughter.
Things have happened in that time.
For example, big rats ran through the kitchen.
Look at the wall of the fridge, it's a meter thick!
They say the solution was on the eggs, so it's been holding up for so long.
The house is well built, thanks to Demidov!
That's probably why no one's been killed by a broken ceiling or a shwai.
Only the building dies slowly in front of us: the boards and logs of the house rot, the floors fail repeatedly, we poured cement, but it's useless - the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say it is, under our room, a secret loophole and a walk to the White River, which was deliberately made by the old faiths who once lived here, so that they could escape the danger, in case of what.
They were being chased.
Ludmila Starstin tells us how some historian came to see them, begged to let him start digging in the apartment.
And then he convinced me to give them the apartment in exchange for his one at the October Prospect.
Ludmila refused the historian:
Where are we four in one?
At least there's a little hope here that'll give you a bigger place to live.
If we agreed to the exchange, we wouldn't have won anything.
However, the Old People's family won nothing.
Ludmila's biggest dream to be scattered, and her daughter and her 16-year-old granddaughter were given a separate room.
So two families have set aside a two - room apartment instead of the most glorious ruins in which two generations now live.
The cute, miniature girl Olesia Karsakova from apartments 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, her large family lives in two small rooms with a total area of 23 square feet [23 m2], called apartments.
There are seven of us, two children.
You can see what the conditions are.
The scooter falls in pieces, as do the window frames, in the walls of the kitchen and in the rooms, throughdoor holes.
The water in the crane is cold all year.
When you walk through the apartments of the oldest house in Ufa, you can make sure that Laurentyev's wives are the most fortunate in apartment 4.
They're occupying the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
It's 75 squares, it's three people.
We live in the very rooms where the legend is that Suvorov stayed while he was in Ufa, says the family leader Alexander Dmitriyevich Laurentev.
The ceilings are tall, spacious.
One bad thing is, everything's cracking, falling apart, falling apart.
Neighbors must have told you already!
The most painful thing we've had with the floors is that the wooden boards have rotted, the earth has literally gone from under our feet.
I've put up the sticks, the blades; there's nothing in the room yet, and in the other room we walk like a swing, it's so shaky.
Alexander Dmitrievich can best tell about the house of merchant Yevdokim Demidov.
A gold industryman is treated as his own, speaks admirably of him.
Indeed, the identity was extraordinary: the owner of the Kagin and Ujiang factories built houses, poured guns and bells, and held Ural mines.
The estate heirs are proud of their ancestors, but they don't want to live under the same roof with history anymore.
I lived here as a child in the 1940s, says Alexander Dmitriyevich.
Then there were wooden carriages, stables, and guard booths, which were subsequently demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to clean up our house, but something prevented...
The story was repeated in 2014: a new home was lured.
As a team, we gathered all the documents, ran through the right authorities, and suddenly we found out that moving to apartments was moving to 2015 or 2016.
I don't believe in this anymore.
Two years ago, Lawrence went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashcortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
Officials didn't accept the tenant.
They sent it from one table to another, and then, as a mockery, they issued a paper without signature and printing: "The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the settlement of the tenants."
I even feel like our house is long gone because it was first number 57, then it was 57 A, and now it's 57/1.
It's like it's already been demolished in the '70s.
The Russian Planet has approached the head of the information and analysis sector of the Ufa Land Administration, Vladimir Barabash.
The House on October Revolution 57/1 is included in the old housing settlement programme.
I can't take responsibility for the actions of the officials of the 1970s, but I know there was a plan at the time to destroy all old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the modern authorities to rebuild all old houses along the October Revolution Street, representing architectural value, has been successfully implemented.
The residents are about to be resettled in new apartments.
According to Barabash, the reconstruction of the Demidov House will be carried out by Italian specialists who were involved in the renovation of buildings in Venice.
An architectural biennal is currently under way in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there, among others.
I hope that by 2016, the entire old Casanian street will be restarted, says the official.
Homes will become suitable for what was before, three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to become a museum open to everyone.
In addition, the Government has decided to make the street a walker on weekends.
Unfortunately, it's not going to happen on a weekday, too much traffic in the city.
Wladimir Barabash promises to settle people from a future museum in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from another era.
A forest fire started in Primorje because of the storm.
The dry storm caused a forest fire in the hunting area of the Primorsky region.
There is a build-up of forces and assets at the site of the fire.
According to the management of the Maritime Air Base, the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of the aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Chief of Air Base:
An observation aircraft from an An-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares found a fire in a difficult area.
There's wood leftovers on the old burner.
The severe slurability of the area and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, and the lack of suitable fire landing sites pose significant challenges in the carnage.
We need an MI-8 helicopter.
The movement of forces by the MI-2 helicopter and the AN-2 aircraft at the disposal of the airbase is very difficult.
After the discovery of the fire, four parachute firemen were quickly disembarked.
The main task of specialists is to extinguish the fire and to prepare the site for the delivery of additional fire-extinguishing equipment.
In the area of lunch, three additional paratroopers were transported by helicopter to the village of Hunter.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the fire area is ready, specialists will be moved to the hangover site on the website of the Primorsky Province Administration.
My father never hugged me.
Never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to an immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry's rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Severe Records, which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew up in a series on Radio 4.
Soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, and melodies are happy.
However, Henry had to get through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother died, there was a lot of treatment, and Henry often pondered about his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice say, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were grown up when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer, the beauty of hitting a cricket.
I've never spoken to him like that before.
He was such a smug guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a lithing workshop in Dudley and, although the conditions were better than in his father’s day, he was able to see what his life must have been like.
It's a little bit better now, but it's dark, smokey, depths of underwater labyrinths with fire and smoke and lots of soot.
My father went into the bathtub and just lay there, and you heard him slowly starting to sing about himself because he wanted to wash himself off the paint shop.
When I got there, I realized that he had done it for years and years to earn us food, and I appreciated him more.
Still, Henry came out of childhood without parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got sick at the very end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he needed as a child.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22 years old!
Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, who he's been married to for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother himself had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I got very, very well and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
Then I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to take a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
Henry's career shift is probably reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Ever since he got his critics' confession for his Othello, he's gone to the theater.
Followed "Fault comedy" and then "Ogast Wilson's fences."
This work is different from sitcoms and comedy, which were an inseparable attribute of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in the factory.
DJ noticed him parading on stage, and wrote about him in New Faces.
His career on television began in the middle of the '70s: "For a long time, I was the only black parodist/comic on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I had to learn to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in "New Persons" in 1975
Since his manager was entitled to the Black and White Menstrue Show, a light entertainment program in which people "blacked their face," Henry discovered that he had been performing it for five years.
My family didn't like it.
I kind of wish it never happened to me, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange, reprehensible attitude, I worked in large areas and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "the award-winning light entertainment classical on British television for years and years" was "the black people's game parody."
Imagining the characters who used to mock black culture in Britain and sing it, Henry worked in an alternative comedy project in the '80s.
The first season of "Show Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984, and in the '90s he was known, among other things, as chef Gareth Blacklock of "Shef!" comedy.
Advertising videos, documentary films, TV series and film roles took over the next ten years of his life, but after his show on BBC in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit like you're dragging time or turning away."
And then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's Good in...?"
The first one was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I can't say I'm being taught that in high school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of middle-class white people with tights and cabbage downstairs.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You need to try.
Don't curse it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of those words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Othello's last monologue for a documentary, and he got caught.
I feel like I can do this.
It's like my head's been fixed.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, take it seriously, teach your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we set it up.
And she was a success.
It seemed like they were waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started the "Fault Comedy."
Suddenly, I'm at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical malfunction, and Henry instinctively felt that his case was to entertain the public.
"A quiet voice inside me said, "You're gonna have to work for 10 minutes while they're fixing the computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my job.
I can let someone else handle this.
"You play in the play, stay in the play."
Henry's in the fences at the Dachess theater.
It was hard to learn the text for the fences.
Panic's pretty useful, it's strengthening muscles.
She was also well received, so it was like a sign from above, showing, "That's what you have to do."
He says it, of course, with a loud voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the rehearsal.
By the way, Henry's still thinking comedian, and all the way to our conversation, he's got his humour flashes, and when he starts, he's done imitation.
I just decided not to work at the stand-up, because this thing with the instant reward from the full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you keep trying to do this, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work at "Apollo Live" when I want to, but mostly I'm not enjoying it as much as I used to.
I'm asking if he'll ever give the stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the road -- I don't think I'd ever want to give it up.
So this is his new embodiment?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and this is a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya began biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government's payroll.
Staff members who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid are reported in the Government application.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving public service.
President Uhuru Keniata promised to reduce corruption in government structures after taking office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million ($700,000) per month was lost through payments to “invisible workers” and other financial irregularities.
The Government suspects that salaries continue to be paid to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves public service, reports BBC reporter Vanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All public servants must report to identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data will be collected by means of a biometric registration procedure, as reported in the Government ' s application.
Anyone who does not do so without a valid reason will be struck off the payroll, as reported.
“This procedure will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of civil servants and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of the Government - thus ending the problem of “invisible workers”, said Ann Weigur, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers for Planning and Structure of Power.
Dozens of Turkish police officers are arrested in connection with a “conspiracy” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the Government”, reports local news agencies.
The police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in the corruption detection exercise last December, which was aimed at vetting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of establishing an organized criminal group and listening to a telephone.
Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdoğan (who was then Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by the Islamic cleric Fathullah Gülen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer vacations.
This day has traditionally been a major event for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yazenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told the waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything in his power to protect the country for future generations:
The ceremony was not held in every school on September 1.
There is no peaceful sky above every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The entire Ukraine, the vast unified Ukrainian people's front, must fight for peaceful heavens.
Alexan Pastukhov, headmaster of a school in Slajansk, to which Yacenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of study is traditionally marked by the children wearing their shirts, holding balloons in their hands, and giving flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, he may have found the impressive leader she needs.
It is followed by a fame plume from the world of banking, media administration and the Tori party's internal circles.
In fact, she has her own experience in leading positions.
Her career began at the Bane and Co Global Governance Consulting Company and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world in Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years when she resigned when a male colleague in a lower position took up a high position in Pearson's head company.
They say her earnings are close to £1 million.
Its political ratings are also strong.
She was recommended by David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector specialists to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet.
Her husband's a former councilman, Tori.
Earlier in May, I named the chairman's work a poisoned cup.
BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two orientations: inside as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but outside as a voice of public anxiety and excitement when something goes wrong.
It is an almost unattainable duopoly that requires complete radical reform.
However, what new president would risk coming, trampling and destroying an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he were to lose his own work in the process.
It's a tough decision.
It wouldn't be that hard, many people would be happy to see the BBC shrink in size, after a review of its powers, finance, and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, inevitable negotiations on the price of a licence pose a particular danger to BBC.
For a modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British gain a share in the most definitely the largest media enterprise in the world.
BBC tells a good story: she states that the results of her work cover 96 per cent of the households and are only 40p a day for each of them.
Moreover, Beeb’s popularity is evidently growing: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
BBC models have changed: I now get news headers on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on the iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman, I hope he found him.
Perry from Texas says that a humiliating tweet was written by someone else.
The tweet from the confirmed account of the Texas Governor of Republican Rick Perry on Sunday evening contained an offensive image of the D.A. from the Democrats, who is in the center of the criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another one from Perry's account, where the tape was disavowed.
I just got a tweet from my account that was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I removed it," says a later recording.
Assistants Perry did not immediately respond to the communications with a request for comments.
Although the records were downloaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was not clear who was actually publishing the tape.
The earlier tweet contained an unfaithful cartoon on the Travis Rosemary Lemberg District Attorney, who was found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol in April 2013.
Perry banned funding for her office when she refused to resign, which led to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 elections.
The tweet says, "I don't always drive a car in a state of intoxication that is three times the allowable amount of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for telling me about it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg wasn't investigating a grand jury against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political trick.
His powerful legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the law used to prosecute a governor who has served the longest in Texas's history is vague, contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding for $7.5 million from state funds to the State Public Control Division, which is based in Travis County and is involved in the prosecution of corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
Veto raised a formal complaint from a group of public control with a left-handed view.
The tape of Perry's confirmed account is often updated and sometimes becomes famous.
Coming to the fifth party meeting in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry responded to rumours that he could quit the game by tweeting a photo of himself running near the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to normal state.
One of London's most famous developers warned that the real estate market in southeastern England had returned to normal levels of activity.
Homes in the capital were the subject of intense demand and fast-growing prices, with widespread fear that the credit bubble would push Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Peejley, founder and chairman of Berkeley's elite construction company, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of this fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013, adding that it provided a "stable working environment."
The London real estate market succeeded during the recession, as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
Prices in the city have risen by 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, according to the Land Registry, significantly exceeding the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for private, affordable and student schemes of Berkeley rose by about one fifth last year, reaching £423000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around a potential “mansion tax” before the next May general election.
The London Real Estate Agency Foxtons warned last week that the April reform of the mortgage market, which introduced tighter loan conditions, would also reduce market growth both in real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Updated data from Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, reduced its forecast of a rise in London real estate prices for 2015 to 3 per cent, based on the fact that real estate prices have begun to weaken.
Meanwhile, transactions fell by a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive parts of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, the demand for houses in the capital was very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales volumes above £2,2 billion.
Mr. Peedley added, "The demand for the right product with the best design and the best location has remained the same and, reflecting it, sales have remained for a long time."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year before the end of April, almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
The annual pre-tax income rose by 40 per cent from the previous year to £380 million, and income increased by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pijley announced that Berkeley's expected income for the year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of the analysts, profits are expected for the entire year prior to the payment of taxes in the amount of £450 million.
Berkeley's shares were held at £23.96 in the afternoon at the London Exchange.
Photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence published online by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving for the 85th annual American Film Academy Award.
Photos of naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won the Oscar Award, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to have a catalogue of photos of another 100 rising stars.
A representative of the Star of the Hunger Games confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real, and condemned the hacker for "invasion of personal space."
Law enforcement has been contacted, and they'll be stalking anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photographs originally posted on the 4chan photo exchange site were allegedly obtained through a lack of Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalogue" of the victims of the hack includes the names of dozens of women of the mark, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's not clear how many of these photos are true, although the star Scott Pilgrim vs. All, Winstead, on Twitter, also condemned the break-in.
"Those who look at the photos that we took with my husband a few years ago in private at home -- I hope you're proud of yourself," Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice from Nikolodeon "iCarly" and "Victoria the Winner" denied that in the photos she tweeted: "These so-called pictures of me naked, people.
Let me stop it in the foetus.
Buzzfeed told me last Sunday that a representative of the pop star Ariana Grande denied that the photos on which she was believed to be true.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's novel about love and the letter "J" that brought praise to critics.
They dissolved, and that's the best way to say it, they gradually collapsed like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.
Only sometimes did a woman tell him that he was too serious, too hard to communicate, tense, closed, and perhaps a little irritating.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw the irritability in himself.
He was stingy like a chicken, yeah.
The last victim of this puny was a little novel from which he expected more than usual to be freed from a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some sort of satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a frightening, fragile, hair-shaped, heart-blowing girl from a northern island village even more remote and harsh than Port Royben.
She came to the south with a companion older than herself, who Kever thought was her aunt, and the last one inherited a house in a raw but paradise-like valley called Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes flowed, the spiders were still in the bathtubs, and the slugs left their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was full of weeds that looked like giant coves of cabbage.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, both frightening and charming, full of secrets in a garden.
The author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the booker's Longlist Award in 2014.
Shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Eileenn sat by their hands in broken sheds of high grass, enjoying the unexpected warm spring day; both of them tampered with the cheap console that provided the country with peaceful music and comforting news, when, after looking at its crossed brown legs, he remembered the old song of a long-forgotten black performer, whom his father loved to listen to, casting curtains in the house.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer lost on consoles.
They weren't banned -- nothing was actually banned -- just not lost anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic."
Public taste did things that would never have been achieved by orders and regulations, and just as people chose the memoirs of rich people who grew up in poverty, cooking books and love novels, they chose ballads from all the music.
After enjoying this day, Kevern began to play the imaginary piano and to sing the big legs of Eileen with a loud, comical voice.
Eileenn didn't understand.
"It was a popular jazz pianist song called Fats Waller," he said to her, mechanically putting two fingers on her lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before it went off his lips.
It started with a game they played when he was little.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start with "J," forgetting to put two fingers on your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun right now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileenn never heard of him.
Jazz didn't play either, although it wasn't explicitly banned.
Improvisation's out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the tune started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with wit.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the wit of music.
Although he had reached the age of 10 without ever hearing of Sammy Davis Jr., Kever knew about the jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
At least he didn't have to tell Aileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The society was obedient, which meant that each segment of it agreed to the gratitude - the gratitude of those who had been saved - of the principle of group predisposition.
People of African-Caribbean origin were well suited for entertainment and sport in temperament and physical characteristics, and they sang and ran.
The people from India, as if they were naturally talented in everything about electronics, were making sure that no family was left without a functioning electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was in plumbing; what was left of the Greek was beating plates.
The people from the Persian Gulf and Levant, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country, when, WHEN ABOUT EVERYTHING, they feared they would be accused of arson, fearing, in fact, that the flame would swallow them next, open up restaurants with labne and cliffs, and they would not stand up, and they would be bored with nothing.
Everyone's talents.
Since she had only heard ballads before, Eileenn was hard to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could have been put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Unless maybe for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved the song.
He said too much, but the garden that he was running gave him an illusion of safety.
No word could penetrate the soundproofing of giant leaves that look like cabbage.
Eileenn didn't understand anyway.
How could your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on her lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in a bad way, closing Kevern's view.
There was nothing in the whole world but a cobble of her black hair.
Nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if you say so," she said, staying in her opinion.
But it still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Ankles, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you because you have fat ankles," he tried to say instead.
I'm so perverted.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often made him uncomfortable because, like his father, he lacked the comforting charm that could mitigate the cruelty of the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be violent.
Maybe he did, Kevern, too.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and rose from the shed, overturning the console and spilling the wine they drank.
Buzzin wine, so drunkenness couldn't justify it.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you because you have a stupid head," she said...
I don't, though.
He felt sorry for her and for the rudeness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she stood up to him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about living in the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that she was basically like this one.
The same huge ice ocean crashed on both of them.
The same misguided men, even more sensitive and presumptuous after what happened, if their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers were more than their ancestors, wandered furiously from the pub to the pub, ready to raise their hand against any woman who dared to refuse or tease them.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
First a kiss -- now a kiss is the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the fresh ballads that the console gave -- to kiss her first and then hit her.
An overstatement, according to Kevern, was because the kiss itself was already a hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons' body showed that he needed to leave.
He climbed out of the shed like an old man.
She felt the weight of lead herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him walk away, and from the top window she watched him walk away, and her companion was a man who himself was burdened.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt compassion for him and the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hand on her.
The man who turned away from her, with his back bent, ashamed, scorned, all the ability to fight left him - why did she feel that she knew it so well if she could not remember a single case until today, when she would see it?
Again, one Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above, or around Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Ofnau, an informal public mood control service, prepared a small report on the persistence of low and average levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decrease if it did not stop completely, given the means and forces allocated to its eradication.
"A lot has been done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "to mitigate the innate aggression of people who fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these mixed branches and narrow splinters of land, where, despite the swaggering swathes of churches, the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt throughout history.
However, some qualities have proved to be inexhaustible.
The higher the spire, the lower the passions it produces.
The population shed tears over sentimental ballads, swallowed up stories of overcome obstacles and declared its ferocious faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only did the old rudeness retain its strong grip in both rural communities and urban settlements, but there was also evidence that new and vicious violence was emerging in homes, workplaces, roads and even playgrounds.
"You have an annoying habit of writing too much," said her academic leader, reading the entire report.
I think you should read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped her head.
I should also ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you gay?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I'm asking," finally said Luther Rabinowitz, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
We don't have any prejudices here.
We are the servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, completely acceptable and praiseworthy in themselves, can sometimes distort results, like the ones you showed me.
Obviously, you're the one who's biased against the church, and what you call "vilest" and "gross," others would interpret as an expression of natural life and energy.
To continue to be bored about what happened if the world was sick, as if it had happened yesterday, if ever happened, was to deprive the country of the life it needed.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz was talking.
Behind his head were pink letters like flamingo, LED letters repeated the advice that Offnau had given the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, value your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, talk, explain, listen, say yes, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, the word of a song is better than a written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I fully understand what you're trying to say," said Esme Nussbaum quietly when she made sure that her scientific leader had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything but that we have not been cured as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I am concerned that if we are not ready, we will discover that we are repeating the mistakes that originally led to what happened if the world was gone.
Only this time, we will throw our anger and distrust at others.
Luther Rabinitz put his fingertips together in the pyramid.
That gesture was supposed to mean endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "calling "mistakes" the actions that our grandfathers did or did not do.
You go too far and when you talk about them throwing their anger and their distrust on "others."
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that by understanding the past, that is, by protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" or "they."
There was no "us" and there was no "other."
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"For which, to be honest with herself," she dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what's done is done.
It was then.
We don't have to say anything else, we agree here.
And as no blame should be given, no excuse should be given if it was appropriate or if something could be fixed.
But why the past, if not to learn--
The past exists to make us forget it.
If I can add one word to that--
The Pyramid Luther Rabinitz fell apart.
"I'll review your report," he said, releasing her.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who was on the sidewalk, as the passers-by described, "in angry rage."
Coincidences happen.
The Lesotho Army states that the coup was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The Lesotho Army denied that it was preparing a coup to overthrow the Government, claiming that it had acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in Maseru.
The premier took his family to neighbouring South Africa, claiming that he had received a threat to his life.
The army spokesman, Major Ntléle Ntoy, said that there had actually been no coup, but that the army had responded to the threat from the “political fanatics” that the police had tried to arm.
“What happened this morning was that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command took action by receiving several intelligence reports that there were some elements among the police that were really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties that were willing to cause chaos,” he reported to the American Voice.
A South African government spokesman, Clayson Monjela, said that the army's actions looked like a coup.
“Although no one has claimed to seize power by force, according to all reports, the actions of the armed forces of Lesotho so far have the main signs of a coup”, he said.
The Lesotho Army reported that the soldiers had returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mottejoa Metsing runs the government in the absence of Tabane.
Tabane stated that he believed that he was under attack in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabana suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in its unified Government.
He stated that his actions did not undermine the Government, despite allegations of the contrary.

A 21-year-old Dutchman will be arriving in Italy within hours for a medical examination.
Last season, he only went to the London Club field three times.
Let's remind you that previously Milan rented from Liverpool's attacker Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at the lowest rate in 13 months
Growth in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to popular research.
The last value of the eurozone production index (PMI) on Markit fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed, and businesses were affected by the growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The values came before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will expect the bank to have a clear plan to cope with the eurozone’s recovery and the risk of deflation at only 0.3% inflation.
It is suggested that ECB leader Mario Draghi may give additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by Britain and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers becomes more evident," said Rob Dobson, senior economist Markit.
The PMI of the German manufacturing sector, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest 51.4 in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a source of concern, as does Italy's weakening from steady growth to stagnation.
The signs that growth has faded mainly from the industrial engine, Germany, as well as from Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add confidence,” said Mr. Dobson.
Industrial slowdown is likely to fuel analysts waiting for additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where the PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist of IHS Global Insight, said, "The best thing to say about the August study of the eurozone production sector business index is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: “The producers of the eurozone seem to find life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially those related to Russia/Ukrainian - add uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has apparently hit the business – and especially the consumer confidence – and is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said "more and more like it," that the ECB would, of course, have to do some kind of quantitative mitigation, "although we suspect it will be limited."
The inhabitants of Mariupol will stand a chain of life against the militia.
In Mariupol, until last week, everything was calm - no one was trying to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Azov Sea lived and worked.
Now the people are horrifyingly waiting for the regiments to arrive.
According to the polytologists, the separatists are breaking into Mariupol to reach the Azov Sea, a town recently taken by Novoazovsk, which was not previously part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupols decided that the Ukrainian army would protect them, although it would protect them, but that it had a little force against the highly armed members of the NPD-LDC, and they were going to help the military.
They're digging trenches, building roadblocks and reinforcements.
On Saturday evening, several thousand people arrived at the eastern border of the city, and they stood there in a living chain singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They're going to do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and transport equipment and food, collect medicine, publish a newspaper.
In the city, shops are gradually closed down, banks and ATMs are shut down.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the terrible grip of the school, like the children who were in it, are still suffering.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were children, were killed during this three-day trial that shocked the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated on death during the violence at school.
Exactly ten years after the terrible seizure of the Beslan school, in which 334 people, including 186 children, were killed, heroically survivors of the disaster warned last night about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed to be some sort of extreme evil.
The tragedy united the east and the west in a disgust, which in an amazing way then turned into action and hope for the future in the face of the worst of grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who cheated on death during the atrocities at school.
We have discovered amazing young people who have stood up to disaster, even though the memory of a terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now afflicting Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now end.
The girl in the photograph trying to get back into the shelling gym.
It was photographed by a famous Russian photographer, Dmitri Belyakov, when in one of his underwear she tried to climb back into the shelling gym after the mine exploded.
In the confusion of Hades, she was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that they both died, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run as hard as she could, but I couldn't," said Aida.
My feet were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she'd recovered completely, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few pieces left in my knee.
Her goal now is to be a dentist, to help people the way the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but of course it didn't break it," she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that fact.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend who was supposed to be my classmate, Dr. Gapoev was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about family later.
She says the capture stays with her, though the memories are a little blurred every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our plight, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from Britain and everywhere.
When I see on the Internet a picture of me climbing into a school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn't happen again.
The boy who ran through the hail of bullets, thinking his mother was dead.
It was his first day in school (the Russians start school at 7 years of age) and survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamar.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw the baby crying on the way, grabbed the baby by the hand, and ran through the hail of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said, "Damir told me his mother was dead.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara got out and was in the hospital with injuries on her feet, in turn thinking her son was dead.
After they were reunited, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now a non-existent newspaper, News of the World), where he was awarded as Protector of Children from Barnardo's Premier Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can tell you that I've lost it in my memory.
I remember right after that, I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer shooting games, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I played in the yard that never got out.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially my toy shop, where I was allowed to choose whatever I wanted and a ride in an open-top car.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine where wars lead to the grief that he and his friends have endured.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who volunteered last week at a women's monastery.
I'm so willing to help.
I want to be a police officer someday, and I hope I'm enrolled in the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48 years old, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the awful silence right after the capture, just there were no kids screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
She remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, help us.
She was grateful to Shery Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Cheri and just tell her that it's been ten years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borsche, they called every local Russian restaurant.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with his water gun, and they ran and played with him.
And it's only been a month after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I still think this world hasn't been better in ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of kids have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is a news story they listen to when they're bored or when they're doing something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he's neither aggressive nor angry.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not focused on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym every once in a while and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it -- I remember him lying on the couch, turning his back on us for hours.
I didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys.
I can hardly believe that for hours I was so sure that he died and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and was on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell around me, when parts of the bodies were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely convinced that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember yelling at him, "Damir, run, run," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
George Illin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking post-capture photograph became decisive for the tragedy in Beslan.
Rest: Survivor of Beslan George Ilín with his mother Fatima after capture in 2004 and right George today
His bloody face had a pattern of fear when he escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarity in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54 years old, was chief physician, and took him to school on the first day of school before taking Vladimir's eldest son to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare," she remembered.
Not exactly alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia survived.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's no day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some of the scenes of these days are in front of me all the time.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
The picture of Georgie (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember that Georgie wanted to go to school that day, that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of crying Georgia in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but I also feel that this picture makes people from all over the world feel our pain.
George says now, "It's important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never find out the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, no one wants war, because how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for that kind of pain.
We need decades to go by to forget her a little bit.
It affected my health, and I still feel it.
I've had nightmares for about three or four years because of the capture, but now I'm feeling better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was really scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym every 1 September.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to the University of Medicine in Vladikavkaz.
I'll learn to be a cardio surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be military, but I didn't get any health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
George Farniev, 20
A boy who survived even though he was at the feet of a killer terrorist.
Improbable: George Farniev was at the feet of the killer terrorist during the capture, but still managed to survive.
During the capture, he was photographed in the gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a killer terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We think it was yesterday," says George, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB, but could not because of the damage to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that kids are easy to deal with bad things, and I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the following year, there was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I passed out.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: George Farniev today with a photo of himself on his laptop at the hospital after the capture.
My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
As for my physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that's been damaged, but now I'm walking normally.
Still, my health prevented me from going to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my files, including medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to veterinary.
I studied there for two years.
He's learning to treat all animals from cats to cows.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
That's not what kids should know, and of course it's not what they should be going through.
His 42-year-old mother Marina said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when my anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate it.
I know Georgie won't go.
It's got to be even stronger for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
George's a grown-up now, but he's still having this nightmare.
It's hard to accept when something so awfully unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had a few surgeries, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he overcame the nightmare by 50%, but you can't completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and it only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and loved.
My son is with me, and it's the best gift God could have given me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm looking at what's going on in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
War is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If we could capture all the rebels and throw them away, as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10 years old
A baby who was moved to safety by a SWAT fighter.
Saved: Alena Zkaewu is being taken to a safe place by a Russian Special Forces (left).
She's ten now, and she doesn't remember a monstrous crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alena carried a Russian policeman out of a captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but her 30-year-old mother, her ten-year-old sister Christine and her brother Mahar left her violently in the school gym.
Mahar, who was then three years old, escaped, but Alenina's mother and sister died in a deadly slaughter.
Her father, Ruslan, has been remarried since then, and he and his new wife, Svetlana, have a little daughter, whom he called Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alona, who is now ten, doesn't remember anything about the capture, and has blossomed into a smart and life-loving girl, says the neighbors.
"They're a big happy family now, and Alona and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father, and he wants to keep them away from all the memories on his tenth anniversary.
You can see why.
Shinji Kagawa's half-defendant, returning from Manchester United to Dorthmund "Borussia", noted that he was looking forward to re-entering the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyous career event.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm going to play for "Borussia" again, - quotes the Bild words of Kagawa.
I feel really good.
It's full of positive emotions and I'm looking forward to getting back on the field in the form of "Borussia."
Remember, Kagawa moved to MU from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to join the English club, spending only 38 games in two seasons in the English championship, hitting six balls and giving eight performances.
A man charged with assaulting a girl at the Pelican walkway in Fife
A 78-year-old man will be tried for assaulting a three-year-old girl at the Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit a girl at the Pittenwyn crossing in East Newk.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stewart was conducting his Audi Q3 without due diligence and attention and hit the girl, causing her injuries.
Stuart, 78 years old, from Anstruter, denied his guilt in the Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, King's attorney, has set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel, and Holland won't hang out in Vladivostok.
A duty-free shop at Vladivostok airport placed a sign prohibiting the purchase of a number of world political leaders in the shop.
They can't eat perfume, vodka, or cognac.
The store decided that US President Barack Obama, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President François Hollande, Vitaly Clique, Julia Timoshenko, Japan’s prime minister and several other famous comrades would not be able to eat vodka, cognac and perfume in their store.
And she put a plaque on the door.
Previously, Obama had been banned from entering an even less accessible facility, the MGU Dietary Cafeteria, as reported by the catering facility website.
Whether the American president had ever dreamed of eating in a dietary canteen in Russia is unknown, but the banners clearly seem awfully witty to themselves.
If there's cheese after the embargo, Medvedev gave advice to the agrarians.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of Russia believes that under the embargo, Russian farmers should develop new technologies to produce the required cheese varieties from buyers.
The Board was given during a visit to the Agrocomplex company by the South Pacific Company.
The head of government also advised the restauranters to refocus on Russian meat, the quality of which is at an appropriate level.
The annual embargo on food imports has been imposed in Russia since 7 August.
The Russian team's chief coach, Valentine Maslakov, is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, third place is a good result given the lack of targeted training for competitions.
Our athletes have performed at their own level, saying "All sports" by Maslakov.
Third place is confirmation of our high command level.
It's nice that the French, and even the Americans, have the slightest advantage over us.
We haven't prepared for these competitions.
The season is over, and we didn't commit our leaders to the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we've been second in this tournament, but this season, we've been re-engineered.
On the other hand, the French put out a capable team of 13 European champions.
They have not concealed their intention to win this year, which they have publicly announced on many occasions.
But even this composition of the competitions couldn't stand up to the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have come to such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were in order below the same Brilliant League.
Season's over.
Naturally, athletes no longer care about results, especially in team-level competitions.
It was about the place.
And as a result, I agree, it's absurd when at 1,500 meters men were so passionate about the tactical tactics of the race that they showed the results below the average... of the women's races.
4 hints to improve the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to photograph or film videos underwater, you have a number of hardware options in front of you.
The cheapest option is a watertight soap, such as Nicon Colpix AW120, or an action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures at the family holiday with a few cameras, all at a cost of about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, there are a few rules that need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Recheck your equipment.
Even if you have a watertight chamber, make sure the cell battery and other compartments are closed tightly.
Also, set up your camera for the kind of photography or video you're going to be filming.
Some photo and video cameras have camera or object-type modes that optimize the exposure for dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our buyer's guidance and digital camera ratings for both traditional and watertight models.
Take some footage, because many of them won't.
The miners have a VCD that will help you compile the photos, whereas the action cameras don't usually have them.
Even if you have LCD, it'll be hard to see underwater, and the frame layout will be a random process.
So make a few frames.
Also, if your camera has a serial shoot mode that shoots several frames with a little bit different displays, use it.
Stay at the surface.
The amount of light decreases significantly, the deeper you dive under the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you shoot in a pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to pass more colors on the photos; the deeper you go, the smaller the color you see.
Come closer to the shooters.
It's a great advice for ground shooting, but it's even more important underwater because of dark light conditions.
Most importantly, if you film an action camera, this equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you're going to have to get close to the camera if you want to fill in the frame.
The 2012 Bilal Mahov Olympics Bronze Prize can move into a Greek-Roman battle.
This was reported by Sazeed Sajidov, the main coach of Dagestan's free will.
He did not exclude the athlete from the Tashkent World Cup in September 2014.
Now, Billal Mahov is at the gathering of the "Classic" team, citing "R-Sport" the words of Sajid Sajidov.
In fact, Billal's junior performance was also in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth First, he became the winner of the Volnik tournament and third prizer in the Greek-Roman competition and decided to focus on the free fight.
It's been a long time since there's been a talk that our heavyweight will spend a new phase of his career in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'll tell you more, Mahov can already perform at the Tashkent World Cup if he wins the outfit.
But the final word is always for the coach's staff led by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of person whose personality might have shaken things up, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
He was an anesthesiologist, who devoted his career to riding patients of both the suffering of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among those who approached him was his wife, an MI-6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson realized that while doctors are obsessed with diagnosis and disease, those who are being treated are mostly concerned about something completely different -- pain.
One day in 2007, however, he turned out to be the one who started to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength in myself.
Fighting symptoms like the flu, he found that he resented his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to go faster, not later," he said.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson found out that he was unusual and unclear why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to get a chest X-ray.
Only two weeks earlier, he had skied in the French Alps.
The X-ray results are back.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the plevre, or lung shell.
For most cancers, it's hard to figure out the exact cause.
Although some smokers suffer from lung cancer, for example, not all people with lung cancer smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the reason is contact with asbestos, fibrous building material, which was once called a miracle, but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that you can ignore.
Asbestos, after all, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the industrial recommendation ban entered into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipe insulation, construction, carpentry, and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era is hardly a cause for concern today.
But this calm is wrong.
Britain appears to be at the peak of the Mesothelioma epidemic today.
There are more people dying of mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
At an annual mortality rate of about 2,500, more than twice as many people die of the disease as from car accidents.
Annual mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we feel its deadly effects now is that, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), mesothelioma usually takes decades to develop.
And the attack by mesotheliomas is not limited to veterans of industrial construction.
Asbest was, and in many cases remains, in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we shop.
As a result, mesothelioma ignores class, wealth, profession, or age.
The Bastions of Choice, from the fancy London department store to private schools, have proved to be no salvation.
The House of Parliament is covered with asbestos.
Even hospitals designed to treat us have proved to be the reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a pipe insulated man.
In fact, he had to think about where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It seems that there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's hospital, where I spent six years on an internship," he wrote.
Everyone -- students, nurses, doctors and transporters -- used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
It was a question that, unfortunately, he could have given a partial answer.
“Of the four doctors who were interned at Gaia Hospital and who subsequently developed a mesothelioma over the past five years, he said in a letter in 2010, “I am the only one who survived.”
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
It's so unusual to live so long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die eight months after diagnosis.
It's always fatal.
So now we can just repeat the question of Lawson, "How many of us are going to get the same disease?"
According to a leading mesothelioma expert in Britain, Professor Julian Pito is most likely to assume that between 1970 and 2050, when an asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to survive, about 900,000 people will die.
Most people don't think they're gonna die like that right now.
Asbest mines in Quebec, Canada
A quick review of reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma’s attack has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that she had been subjected to exposure to asbestos by an oversight.
She worked online for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children over the age of 20.
"Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
It never occurred to me that it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They were given their name by the word “asbestiform”, which means a fibrous structure that informs them of strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler stitches, even in the brake pads of cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage”, which could lead to death.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crokidolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that “there are strong, albeit indirect, reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the extremely high number of mesothelioma patients [in Britain]”.

Janice Ellen may not have thought of himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Pito suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of the patients, which suggests that “a significant percentage of mesothelioma, when no known exposure to work or home, was likely to be caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment”.
Most of this exposure, he says, is due to the "usual use and effects of weather" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which discussed the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even at the very heart of the government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committee premises had been contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibers could be driven by something as harmless as “severe air streams”.
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case the opposite seems to be true.
Although the Directorate of Maintenance of Parliament insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a “pure sanitary certificate”, it now recognized that it was necessary to work for £1 billion to rebuild Parliament by improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that, after the 2015 general election, members of Parliament might meet at the QE2 conference centre nearby rather than at the Westminster green berths.
The Goddard report noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed according to different regulations”.
It is impossible to know whether this mismanagement error will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who never managed to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50 years old, he suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that was successfully sued for asbestos," he said, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places where I worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009, when he was struck by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45 years old, and he was in the middle of the operation late tonight.
Suddenly, I started to get feverish.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't drive all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from a pleura, a shell around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
Eventually, he couldn't go to work for a month.
The puzzled doctors took x - rays of the chest and placed pleural catheters to extract the fluid from the lungs and send it to the tests.
Still, his condition was undiagnosed.
Gradually, his health improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms came back, often after he was engaged in sports and breathing hard.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients went to his waiting room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott did not link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was tens of years older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and the doctor consulting him showed his CT results and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, the camera sensor was inserted into the cavity between the casing of his chest and the casing of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year's, "I've been told it's mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosed Mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott went into meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings where asbestos was often insulated on pipes," he said.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now strikes younger people with atypical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in the basements, so it is unlikely that patients would be affected.
But many of the officers who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to toxic substances.
For decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were a place where, theoretically, they saved the lives of the people, but a place that threatened the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
Schoolboys put their Bunsen burners on asbestos pads.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of its remarkable insulation and fire resistance characteristics.
Schools, too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos for the first time in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry classes, schoolchildren placed their Bunsen burners on asbestos pads.
Websites have emerged that highlight the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roofs of barns generally contained asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison embedded in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy's hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden barn in the 1970s.
So be careful with the garden sheds.
The effect of diagnosis when it is known that the disease is incurable is enormous.
"It takes a lot of time to realize this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and take care of myself.
Well, I won't see Christmas again.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a doctor to a patient.
As countless patients before him, he remembers how confused he was with the amount of information he needed to receive.
"It was hard to understand," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I've been given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, because it is the mechanic of how we sustain life - the act of breathing itself - that causes cancer that kills.
Most mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers inhale, they can be stuck in a mold, a lung shell.
Asbestos fibers irritate the plevre and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem arises from the inhalation of needles of asbestos fibres”, by Professor Tom Treger, cardiothoracic surgeon, who came to Guy Hospital in 2001.
It's the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos, ironically, now leading the Mesothelioma treatment center.
The trainer knew Lawson and treated some of the others who were probably exposed in the hospital.
When the needles of asbestos fall into the tissue of the lungs, he says, "by breathing it out into the periphery where the shell is located.
This is essentially an invasive process from the beginning.
Normal treatment options for other forms of cancer are far less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, is highly controversial.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Coach doesn't agree.
"It's impossible to cut out the plevre," he says.
You can't walk around her with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer "is not very good at chemotherapy," which "acts" but doesn't cure.
"Sometimes there are sick people who live long," says Treger.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen J. Gould died 20 years after he was diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis, had become a single support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he was happy to hear when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
At first, Abbott was offered six rounds of chemotherapy that would take four months and prolong his life for only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "have worked out to make things a little more positive."
After meeting several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loick Lange-Lazdunski, a professor of thoracal surgery at Gaia Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need a direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," Graham admits.
The average patient would have to receive direction and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for mesothelioma patients in order to obtain the best available treatment.
However, when such treatment finally proves to be inefficient, many patients face another financial cause for concern - about the future of the families they will leave.
And then they apply to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It was known that asbestos had been harmful to health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small quantities could put health at risk.
That's when the company's bad faith came up.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a "full-cost settlement," according to Morgan, because Lawson could not prove clearly that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Guy's hospital.
After an investigation into his death, the representative of Gaius Hospital confirmed, however, that “the asbest in the basements in question was removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, linking lethal contact with asbestos to one company or workplace - usually decades later - proved to be a major problem for mesothelioma patients requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers changed ownership or closed down.
The insurance records could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that they have no time on their side, of course.
In response this year, serious new legislation emerged that facilitates the recovery of compensation for mesothelioma patients, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under this law, a £350 million fund financed by the insurance industry has been established for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but who have no one to sue.
In such cases, the sick will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case, about £1200.
Some 300 successful suits are expected every year under this scheme.
Andrew Morgan, as many people who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350 million are “very good work” for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal written by insurers for insurers," he says, insinuating that the sum is a quarter of what the insurers would have had to pay if they hadn't interfered with the time and the Mesothelioma patients would have been able to track down the companies and file a claim in the ordinary way.
Even Mike Penning, previously Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was “improved”.
However, both Penning and Morgan recognize that while seven people die every day, quick action was needed.
"People suffer so much, and they need help today," said Penning during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Bill last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunski recommended surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considered effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - tritherapy, where Lange Lazdunski can boast of 40 percent of the survivors in five years.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's some power that supports you.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott went into surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Subsequent scans showed no sign of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots in my chest.
I was about to turn 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
Again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things -- finances when I die, for example, or showing my wife how a timer works on a boiler.
When you get the bad news, you get gloomy.
We have to look forward.
As Ellie's father, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
The first time I was diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn't live to be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very social and energetic.
She told all her friends, and a lot of people called us very quickly.
Ally was more tempered.
She didn't talk much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for mesothelioma patients, such discussions are not balanced by hope, not even a glimpse of the possibility of survival.
This disease carries a dark certainty (even as Stephen Jay Gould eventually carries it).
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mezothelioma is not a threat to life.

The modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even notes) and tissues.
Large asbestos mines are opened in Canada and South Africa and soon thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It's the perfect thermal insulation for steam engines and industrial revolution turbines.
Global asbestos production is increasing to over 30,000 tons per year.

No compensation is paid.
During the Second World War, shipbuilding, one of the most deadly professions in terms of exposure to asbestos, is an intensive development.
Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for health damage caused by exposure to asbestos in the United Kingdom.
Global asbestos production has grown to more than 4,213,000 tons per year.
Britain imports 139,000 tons.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety in Britain requires that all contractors working with asbestos be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in Britain.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act is enacted in the United Kingdom.
A compensation scheme of £350 million has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is approximately 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters swear revenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to start long-awaited protests in the Hong Kong business quarter, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the National People’s Congress essentially allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It did not fail our expectations, but it still rages," said the legislator Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They tricked Hong Kong's men.
And obviously we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defending China's decision, Lee Faye, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that allowing the popular nomination of Hong Kong's leader for election would be too “haotic”.
Since 1997, when Britain transferred control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the people of the region to vote for the head of government since 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the Sunday decision as a democratic step forward, as it gave the Hong Kongs the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of the Peking Candidates Commission.
And according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision was taken after the summer, when some of the largest and most widely publicized protests in Hong Kong took place over the years.
The Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement is behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong, whose organizers threatened to shut down Hong Kong’s financial area unless Beijing guarantees the right to vote.
On Sunday evening, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers stated that their movement was moving towards a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise in the waves of protest in the following weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “considered the possibility of taking over the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that could be taken only if all possibilities for dialogue were exhausted and there was no other choice.
It is with great regret that we report that, to date, every opportunity for dialogue has been exhausted and that the seizure of the central region will certainly take place.
Government authorities in Hong Kong had been preparing for Beijing ' s statement for several days, and security measures had been strengthened at Government headquarters on Sunday, involving police and barricades.
Many in Hong Kong feel that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of residents from the mainland increases competition in goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize Occupy Central, saying that its demonstrations put Hong Kong’s business life force at risk.
"The protest they're talking about can cause great economic damage depending on how many people will be involved and how long," said the legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to be alarmed that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
It's an idea that's bad for investment.
Chinese public media have also reported in recent days, in which Hong Kong democratic activists have been portrayed by subversives sent by Western Powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
And in July, tens of thousands went to one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
American prom culture reaches university life: first-year students were offered a personal jet
We are happy to respond to such a demand by launching the UK's first lux travel service for current students.
The company also offers transport options such as a personal aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service was thinking about safety.
This service is the perfect alternative for students who usually have to carry their stuff across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new versions for the VIF, we look forward to helping students this year reach university with the least effort and maximum luxury.
The representative of the company reported that, as the service had just been launched, no orders had yet been received, but added that “students will start ordering the service in the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that, although students needed to pay £90,000 a year, it hoped to find a market for the service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: more important than ever to make an excellent first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Student Union criticized this service as being detached from reality.
Megan Dunn, the NSS Vice-President for Higher Education, said, "This project seems incredibly detached from the lives of most students.
Many students who start university this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to meet the rapidly increasing costs of basic needs before they can even begin to think about taking thousands of pounds out of something like a simple arrival in a dormitory.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police behaviour after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come raise their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot" while they wait in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in connection with the murder of an unarmed teenager, Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez observed a shift in online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who had left comments had placed the gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as the tensions in the Middle West grew and national attention was drawn, Perez saw the responses of white women, who concentrated 100 per cent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the murder of 9 August, personal essays with headlines such as “the thought of Ferguson on behalf of a white woman” and “Feminism is not only about the oppression of women” appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there's a lot of people talking about white skin color and privileges at this high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic for the crisis that we're facing, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so racially related, they felt they needed to point it out.
For a professor of English at Ohio State University, Mitchell Ferguson exposed the problems that black American women face every day but which are not perceived as “women's problems” in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's happening to me and my partner, and get 150 liquor from everywhere," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how colored people are attacked in their own country, silence is deafening.
"Why is it safe for women to talk publicly about relationships, but not about public safety?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly share these problems; they faced a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine race and gender issues in feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"At least 10,000 black men were lynched between 1865 and 1890, almost always based on the rape of a white woman," told Hattery.
It took a white woman to confirm the story to justify lynching.
From Hatteri's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white subfractionists, such as Susan B. Anthony, examined the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for electoral rights would only be effective for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in a basket of women's voting rights, and the blacks' voting rights were due to appear later," told Hattery.
Looking back at such things gives us a clear idea why colored women don't trust white women.
We haven't done anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women achieved voting rights in 1920, it took 10 years for white women to unite against vigilantes in the Association of Women of the South for the Prevention of Litigation.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, said Mitchell.
From Mitchell's point of view, the rise of white feminists' reactions to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to deal with the problems that black women had to deal with in several generations.
"I mean, it would be great if activists with such [traditional feminist] ideology took the right to raise a child as seriously as they did the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
The second wave feminists who have made careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what that means.
The famous white activist Gloria Steinem, a feminist, used Facebook two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, and published a sharp article by the columnist Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans take more part in racist protests.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger of the body - and the views on racial issues that differ significantly in public polls - will be at the forefront of change," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem is vouching for a more intersecting feminism that includes both race and gender issues, her comments on race in America are still surprising to some.
Researcher Christine Sommers of the American Business Institute, author of "Who stole Feminism?", said She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, were “more vulnerable than their sisters”, but Steinem’s remark about Ferguson contradicted her earlier criticism.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, "The Watcher of My Brother" to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking youths, a bitter reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem that promotes traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested some 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the south-west border of the country this year, immigration reform came back to the surface – this time as a women’s problem.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present the problem as important to women, she simply needed to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of workers are granted visas [to male immigrants], women who come with them find themselves vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are resonant with women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich pig house is for sale.
The photo of the house on sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it showed that it was a large pig resting in the living room.
It's on sale for £120000, a separate house with one bedroom on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was a photograph of the living room of the house, which depicted a pig with a head resting on the couch.
The Real Estate Agency, Connells, reported that the pig in the photograph was the homeowner's favorite.
“However, the photograph was erroneously posted and has already been deleted”, stated the company's representative.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique separate house with one bedroom".
Although the agency removed the photograph from its website, it is still in advertising.
The sale of the house generated interest in social media, where some asked if the pig was sold with the house.
The Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the fourth round of the US Open game, Caroline Wozniatsky, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year with dignity and try to get to a new level, transferring Vasily OSYPOV from New York.
How would you generally appreciate your results at the Great Helmet tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad I won the Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now I'm, of course, upset.
I couldn't even get to the quarterfinals.
What challenges do you have before the end of the season?
After the unfortunate defeat, I have a huge motivation to get to a new level.
I have something to work on, and I'm going to do everything I can to make it a decent year.
The Asian series of tournaments starts in a couple of weeks.
A member of the State Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth, former world champion Nikolai Valuev, offered to give GTO bonuses on admission to higher education.
According to him, generally, the standards would be the same as in Soviet times - people would pass the standards by pull, run, and other exercises.
Recall that 12 Russian entities will begin implementing GTO standards on their territory on 1 September.
I also offered the students who had passed the GTO to give bonuses on their admission to higher education, noted Valuev.
For example, you can add some points to the EEG.
There are also proposals to give additional leave to employees of enterprises who have passed the sports tests.
A new millionaire appeared in Harvey town in South Wales after winning the lottery.
He's a lottery player from Harvey this month.
There's a search for a new millionaire southwest of Perth, where one lucky guy will take home almost $1.1 million from a lottery game on Saturday night.
The newsstand in Harvey brings gold to the grand prize for the second time in five years, the last winning was $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to make a statement.
The store owner Steve Forward said that the winnings caused a big deal in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole town's talking about it, and everyone's pretty excited.
We thought it might be a secret win.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the winners of the major prize last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, a Canning Vale player became one of the five millionaires of August, following a huge $7.5 million win from Belmont a few weeks before.
The winning couple had been playing for 20 years and reported that the winnings had given them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.
A millionaire from Harvey brings the number of winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
Mino-Economy wants to accelerate the growth of the market for electric vehicles.
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce a comprehensive plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, and the Deputy Director of the Ministry's Department, Oleg Plujnikov, at a round table held by Vedosti on the Moscow Motor Show 2014.
The plan is mandated by the Government and one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted at the end of September - early October, says Plujnikov, the proposed measures concern electric vehicles and hybrids - a road map for the development of gas-fuelled vehicles in Russia is already in place.
The plan (with a copy of Vedomets) is designed for 2014-2017.
Criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid transport are to be developed and how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
A report to the Government describing tax and customs support measures for electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; a scheme of concessional lending and concessional leasing will be available by April 2015; and proposals for lowering the price of machines, encouraging localization and building service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, changes in regulations are envisaged to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure (parking, filling stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals to regional authorities in the course of 2015 to encourage the use of environmentally friendly transport, in the form of an advantage in traffic and parking, for example, and by February 2016, and proposals to expand public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will include in the list of performance indicators for regional authorities criteria reflecting the effectiveness of support for cleaner transport production and the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric vehicles in Russia is still emerging, with about 100 electric vehicles sold throughout the country in 2013.
In early 2014, an import duty for electric vehicles was removed, so sales would be about 500 grand, predicted by Andrei Pankov, Chief Executive Director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia.
But five-fold growth does not make electric vehicles noticeable: in 2013 in Russia, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million light and light commercial cars were sold.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric vehicles to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start imports - the company focuses on corporate clients, says Renault’s Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships in Russia, Nicolas Remiz.
Most other electric transport manufacturers have taken a wait-and-see position with regard to Russia.
The development of electric vehicles is also available to Russian manufacturers - "", GAZ, "", but the output is negligible.
For example, in January and July 2014, according to ASM Holding, Autowaz released 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low because of the high cost of electric vehicles, admits the Director of Autowaza for engineering by Sergey Amanov, there will be no breakthrough in this segment...
The development of the Russian market for electric vehicles, in addition to the expensive machinery (the electric vehicles sold in Russia, on average twice as much as the equivalents of internal combustion engines), is hindering the lack of charging infrastructure (fuelling units), and is being sighed by the CEO of the Autostat, Sergei Celkov.
Due to the high cost and low rate of cost reduction, electric vehicles will remain a niche segment of the Russian market in the next three to four years, predicted by the editor-in-chief of the Autorevu, Mikhail Podorozhanski, and agreed with it.
On the other hand, automakers say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the normal cost.
The Russian market for electric vehicles has good prospects, and the main thing is to build confidence in consumers that “electronic mobility” is real; this will be facilitated, in particular, by the emergence of new charging stations, by the President of the BMW Group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimma.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented by, for example, the Rosseti State Company: several stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon be available.
Negotiations are also under way with other regions for the construction of a fuel network.
According to the director of Rossete, Vladimir Sofjin, the company believes in the market for electric vehicles and is ready to build gas stations all over the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of different brands.
In addition, Rosseti, as a network company, is not allowed to sell electricity, and the possibility of charging electric vehicles is being explored.
Pankov believes that the most effective measure is to control the formation of a market for electric vehicles in Russia by removing customs duties.
The zero rate will remain in effect until the end of 2014, and the possibility of extending it is being explored and expanding the preferential list.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environment (the idea is discussed and concerns all machines) will also support the market, but not as tangible as the customs preferences, Pankov considers.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike Norway, for example, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in the sales of electric vehicles - now accounting for 12% of the market.
Russia also needs incentives for autoowners, such as parking free of charge in the city centre (as already done in Moscow), the confidence of Pankov, or the ability of electric vehicles to travel along the marked lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado.
Piper PA-46 crashed in the U.S. state of Colorado.
Three of the five people in it died, handing over ITAR-TASS.
The survivors have been taken to the hospital.
The accident took place a few kilometres from the Denver airport runway.
The causes of the tragedy are now being identified.
In Donetsk province, prisoners of the Donbas Battalion are being dealt with.
The punishers were surrounded by Ilowaysk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of Sylvesters were killed under fire.
The survivors say that if they knew what the actual situation in south-eastern Ukraine was, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners are lucky.
The Donbas Battalion's cartels were left alive after the meat chopper they hit under Ilowaysk.
In an army surrounded by the Donetsk People ' s Republic, militants spent several days de facto abandoned by their commanders and Ukrainian authorities.
When the headquarters reported that the ring could be removed from the corridor allegedly provided, the column moved.
But just a few minutes later, the shells and bullets were hanging from all sides.
"On the basis of the information I was given, we had a corridor, and we were allowed to leave," he says, "the deputy commander of the battalion, who has the name "Lermontov."
And when we went down to the bottom between Multipole and Rednosel, there was a crossfire with anti-tank guided missiles, "jumps", 30-millimeter grenade launchers, BMD automatic guns, small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three cars in the back, and there were only two cars left.
An officer named "Lermontov" says that almost immediately at least 60 people died, dozens were injured, many died later.
Survivors are now being treated by those they come to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give them food, medicine.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and condemned them to the right death.
We were simply betrayed, they say.
The column, the entire battalion to be destroyed.
To the Donbass Battalion, like many of his comrades, Alexei volunteered because the Ukrainian news reported the atrocities allegedly committed by the separatists in the southeast.
This is where Alexei saw a whole different picture.
His mother was killed in Lugansk, not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that there was a mortar attack going on, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces,” says one soldier, Alexei.
After that, I wanted to leave the battalion.
They didn't let us out of Ilowaysk, they said we were in a ring.
I've already arranged with the commander, and I've already written a report on my departure.
We were immediately taken to Ilowaysk from our fees with Zurahvo.
According to the prisoners, there's a 300-350 man trapped in the Cotla under Ilawisk.
Some survivors now admit that if time could be reversed, they would never have joined the punitive battalion.
All the prisoners were handed over by the militia to the DNR forces.
Everyone will be tested for involvement in war crimes.
A food price control headquarters has been established in the region
A headquarters has been established in Krasnoyar province to limit the price of products in the region if necessary.
A decree establishing this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters consisted of members of the Government of the province, representatives of the executive branch and oversight agencies.
Together, they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the province.
- Will Kiev Rosnefti recover $140 million in damages?
The head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, stated that the company estimated the damage caused by the shelling of the Lisician NPP in Ukraine at $140 million.
He reported it in an interview with Speegel.
"We estimate $140 million worth of damage and will negotiate compensation with the Ukrainian government," said Sechin.
According to him, the renovated Lysican NPP was planned for operationalization in 2014.
However, part of the factory was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no fighting, there were no "exploited rebels," but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial site.
Also, the technological oil pumped into the pipes is missing," he said.
Recall, on 18 July, the oil storage tank was burned down and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed in connection with the firing of the Lisician NPC.
The Lysican NPP is the main refinery in Ukraine, and the first phase of the plant was launched in October 1976.
The total capacity of the LSN is about 7 million tons of oil per year.
The plant is capable of producing fuel from Euro 4 as well as diesel batches from Euro 5.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the LSN were suspended due to its loss.
The company decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisican NPP together with other Ukrainian assets of TNC-XB.
The DPRK launched a short-range projectile towards the Japanese Sea.
According to South Korean media, this occurred around 10:30 a.m. local time from the province of Chagando, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
As Interfax was told in the Joint South Korean Chiefs of Staff Joint Committee, it is believed that the missile fell into the Japanese Sea after flying some 220 kilometres.
The ruble falls under geopolitical pressure
At the Moscow Exchange, the dollar grew at the opening by 3 cops to 37.15 roubles, and the ruble fell to a bobby basket against a background of geopolitical tension.
ETS tenders for the dollar started with transactions at 37.11-37.2 roubles/$1 in an average of 37.16 roubles/$1 in two minutes, which is 4 cops above the previous closure.
The euro was 48.79 roubles per euro, which is 3 cops above the previous closure.
The price of the battling basket added 3.5 cops to 42.395 roubles.
The U.S. dollar trades 23 cops above the official course, the euro 16 cops above the official course.
The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but there was no panic this time.
He continued to be cheaper and ruble, and even updated his historical maximum to the dollar.
Now investors are already pre-empting the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
But so far, it's more like an artificial hysteria that's spiked through the media, especially the Westerns.
There are not many options for introducing new sanctions against the Russian Federation.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to weaken sharply against the punch basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, unless we see a new negative in the near future, both Russian indices and national currency positions can be adjusted.
Orenburg Airlines will be suing Perfect Tour.
Orenburg Airlines brought a total of 4.7 billion roubles to Ideal Tour.
These are two cases that will take place in October.
There will be different judges to try cases.
According to Interfax, the first suit was filed on 14 August.
It's a little over 425 million rubles.
The meeting is scheduled for 7 October.
The second application was filed on 18 August.
It's 4.24 billion roubles.
The meeting is scheduled for 2 October.
Journalists in the Russian Union of the Touring Industry have been informed that there are different judges appointed.
In July, Ideal-Tura's debt to Orenburg Airlines in the amount of 1.5 billion roubles was reported in the media.
The CEO of the airline, Victor Zukin, speaks of 1.6 billion rubles.
The CEO of Aeroflot, Vitaly Savelyev, calls an even larger sum of two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to be more interesting to new users
Twitter microblogs has changed the user registration process to involve new players more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of microblogging people.
Now, new Twitter users will view a large number of service-recommended accounts during registration, so that they can immediately form their own reading circle.
The recommendations are drawn up on the basis of the interests indicated in the registration.
Twitter automatically ticks the subscription for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to make his own checkers so he doesn't read those he doesn't care about.
While microblogists used to see only the avatars of recommended users, Twitter now produces a sample of one of the blogger’s popular tweets to help make the impression of the person.
This is the largest change in Twitter registration in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been actively working to upgrade the service.
This activity is primarily linked to the continuing efforts of the service to achieve cost-neutrality.
In 2014, the microblog service experienced a slower growth in the user base and a decline in reader activity.
The company is now desperately in need of more consumer loyalty, which would have stayed a long time at a time.
That's the only way to ensure a steady flow of advertising.
A day of knowledge in Moscow will be a rainy day.
The first September in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy throughout the day, reporting by meteorologists.
The air temperature in Moscow will be between 16 and 18 degrees, and in Moscow it will be between 13 and 18 degrees.
When cloud clouds clear the weather, the rains will pass, and the wind of the east quarter will be quite weak - only 3-8 meters per second.
Vehicle recycling programme resumed on 1 September
As of 1 September, the vehicle recycling programme has resumed in Russia.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As explained by the Head of the Ministry of Trade of the Russian Federation, Denis Manturov, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation through redeployment from other areas of support.
The programme will affect all vehicles over the age of six.
The compensation will range from 40,000 per car to 350,000 roubles per truck.
Previously in Russia, a similar vehicle recycling programme was in place.
The main difference in the current project, the Minister explained, is that not only is it envisaged that machines will be disposed of to obtain a discount, but also that if the car is over six years old, it will be possible to buy a new one with a discount on the old one at the Trade-in dealer's handover to Interfax.
More than 16 billion roubles were spent on the previous federal recycling programme, which was in operation from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
It produced about 1.2 million cars in 2010 (plus 101.4 per cent in 2009).
The Creator of Coming Out Simulator will issue a game on modern journalism
Game designer Nicky Keyes, famous for Coming Out Simulator, decided to release a game on contemporary journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Keyes started work on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact is only now widely known.
A source of inspiration for the game was the events in Ferguson, where protests are taking place after a policeman killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has not yet been named, will be how the information coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will have to take pictures of what's happening in areas where there's a clash between the police and the public.
A hero can take a different picture of what's going on, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the police look like heroes and the protesters look like bandits, the police will treat him better and let him go where the ordinary man can't go.
If he does not cover the events differently, his photographs can turn peaceful protests into a massive riot.
The points in the game will need to be put on Twitter of the hero, where new subscribers will appear if the photos posted there are popular.
The game has no name yet.
The date of exit and the platform on which it appears is unknown.
Case, however, has published an image showing how an event can change depending on how a photograph of it is taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Keyes, he explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but originally wanted to devote it to events in the Gaza Strip rather than to protests in the United States.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw media coverage of events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game motivated by what had happened.
Nikki Keyes is an independent developer who produces browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which describes events from Keyes' own biography, focuses on how a bisexual teenager tries to tell homophobic parents about his relationship.
Heleteus is dragging Ukraine into further bloodshed.
In an appeal to prepare for another “ten thousand” of the victims, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine, Valeri Guéltey, has drawn the people into a bloody confrontation, as stated in the report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
“In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the remarks made by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valery Geletheus, who declared “the completion of an operation to free Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the “Great Domestic War”, which would amount to “tens of thousands”.
The level of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published the post on his Facebook page, a subject for research by non-military specialists, is stated in a communication from Russian diplomats.
They hardly believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “On informal channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that if resistance continues, they will be willing to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
He stated, however, that “Operation for the Liberation of Eastern Ukraine” had been completed.
Perez Hilton deleted all intimate images of the stars and apologized.
Today, more than 60 Hollywood stars have been terrorized.
Hackers hacked primitive passwords in iCloud in smartphones, after which their intimate images appeared on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
Not for long, really.
To recall, Jennifer Lawrence, an official of the Star of the Hunger Games, has already reported the theft of photos from her cell phone, and has confirmed that all photos that shine on the Internet are authentic.
Perez Hilton, the creator of a single tabloid website, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her workshop colleagues for publishing their candid images, writing The Independent.
No, no one made me do that.
I wasn't contacted by their agents.
And now I'm going to remove Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice's face-to-face photo," wrote a blogger on Twitter.
However, all the candid pictures of the stars have already spread over the Net.
David Beckham was in an accident hiding from the paparazzi.
David Beckham crashed on a motorcycle, fleeing the paparazzi.
It happened in Los Angeles at a corner on Sunset Boulevard.
The British footballer got rid of the bruise and sprain of his right arm muscles.
Beckham came out of the tattoo salon where the paparazzi was waiting for him.
Leaving their pursuit on a motorcycle, he failed at the turn of control and fell down, writing TMZ with links to a footballer's close sources.
In the end, Beckham suffered a bruise, a spraining of his right arm muscles, and a scratch.
Tony Stewart's crashing back on the track.
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended a little more than in the middle of the Atlantic Motor Speedway race.
Stuart hit the wall for the second time after his right front tyre exploded on 172 laps, ending his performance.
Stuart drove his wrecked car to the garage and then left without talking to the reporters.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that 14 team members were upset, but now they're gonna focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I'd like a better try and a better finish for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hopefully we can do better there.
Stuart first hit the wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Bush, which required repair of the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty big hope of coming to the finish well," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart’s car was loaded on the tow truck, and the team was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Spring Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver while driving down a dirt road in the north of New York State.
He decided to come back this week, and he had to win either Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to take part in the chase.
He returned to work during an investigation into a tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who went to the highway to express his displeasure with Stuart during the race.
Law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that at least two more weeks would continue to investigate the cause of the accident.
No decision was made as to whether Stuart would be charged.
Three times the champion was greeted with loud shouts and applause when he was presented before the race.
Started from position 12, Stuart went to the first 10 at the beginning of the race, reaching position 4.
Then on 122 laps after Bush's restart number.
Car 18 came off the trajectory at the exit of turn 2 and hit Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart went on, but he's down to 21st position.
Sobchak and Wittorgan eat cigarettes with Zvanetski in Odessa.
Xenia Sobczak and Maxim Wittorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV host did not fail to report in her Instagram.
True, one photograph surprised and confused the couple’s fans.
The picture was taken at Zvanetsky's.
"At the breakfast at Mikhalyc Mikhalych Zvanetsky Maksim explains what instagrams:) #odessa", signed a photograph of Xenia Sobchak.
But there's nothing on the table but cigarettes.
No coffee, no buns, no butter, and...
The couple’s fans decided that Xyusha smokes too, and they condemned her for it.
"Whose cigarettes?, "Smoking kills!", "What kind of cigarette breakfast" , "Should be at breakfast and only cigarettes on the table))), "Xenia, do you smoke too?", were worried about her favorite followers of her blog.
Let me remind you, Sobchac recently boasted of what a delicious meal Maxim Whitorgan had made her for the first time in her life.
"Happy is when you come to the house, and your husband has made dinner for your visit (for the first time in your marriage, but it's delicious. It's important that at the end of the dinner he doesn't say the words of the joke, "that it should be like this every day," she boasted her husband, Xenia Sobchac.
The picture shows Maxime making something diligent, and there's salts and roast chicken on the table.
Bulgarian prison officers conducted a national protest
Hundreds of prison officers from all over Bulgaria conducted a national protest against the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
During a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the return of the previous working conditions that had recently been changed.
The salary increase is also part of the list of requirements to be discussed with the Acting Minister of Justice, Christo Ivanov.
During the month, the officers protested symbolicly against the new schedule of work, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the Prison Service Union met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice on several occasions, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reports.
Negotiations are ongoing, as reported by the BND Head of the General Department for the Execution of Punishments, Rosen Jeliazkov.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protest by the prison workers' union.
The army controls the new Thai government
General Praut (right) appointed to the post of Defence Minister, Rulet Wongsuwan (left)
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praut Chang-Ocha, announced the composition of the new Cabinet of Ministers in which more than a third of the positions were occupied by retired or retired generals.
The army received key positions: the Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praut Chan-Ocha was officially appointed Prime Minister following the King of Thailand's formal approval of the appointment of the head of the Interim Military Government to that post.
A 60-year-old military officer who took power in the country as a result of the bloodless coup d'état of 22 May was the only candidate for the prime post.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
The army had previously appointed members of Parliament.
According to Prauta Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations during which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinavat ' s Government.
Officially, Praut Chan-Ocha will be a provisional premiere, as the military plans to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that the military are trying to strengthen its authority in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May
With the total paralysis of civil power.
Leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country ' s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Chinavat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army removed Brother Yinglyk Chinawat Thaksin as Prime Minister.
Both are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern part of the country, which has ensured their success in the elections on several occasions.
However, many middle-class and capital elites have joined the anti-government movement, which has virtually paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one said that the media salad would be better, I didn't promise you that, and the waitress from the new Palm brass series is being spanked.
You have to formally admit that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain constant.
Everyone knows for a long time, we say "Belgium" -- we mean media, we say "Mids" -- we mean "Belgium."
Restaurantists like to say deeply that the success of an institution depends on three factors: location, location, and yet again location.
There's places that aren't good, they're even great, but they're bad luck.
Anyway, when I sat at Palm's table, I remembered that there was once a City Café, then an Odessa-Mama, and a restaurant called "God" and a "Friends" beer.
Now it's a beer room again, but it's not nostalgic Soviet, it's Belgian.
Only the tip of the iceberg was placed above the ground: a bar and a couple of tables, and all the rest of the space is devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But it's fun, like in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows -- TVs where girls swim.
Belgium’s institutions in Petersburg are no longer new, so there is something to compare with.
There are eight types of spill beer (260-300 roubles per 0.5 litres) and countless bottled beer (170-1550 roubles).
The companist-positive waitress presents the menu with fun, saying that "Mids are full big seed," and it should be noted that it is the service, despite some shortcomings, that is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected for content, but often very unexpected for execution.
Well, for example, who's supposed to predict that a meat loaf with a Walloon prune (280 rubles) is actually a carpaccio cut so thin that parchment paper would seem uglyly thick compared to it.
You can only taste something if you warm up the poultry.
It's worse with salads.
Classic leash (260) would be the right thing to do to make it a crime against the Belgian people: some sleazy iceberg, once cooked a long time ago, fries, scattered Kenyan beans, beans of bacon, and some kind of marooned onion.
You don't want to meet anyone with such a lazy salad!
The composition of the ingredients of Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was not positive either.
If it was still possible to close your eyes on unripe quarters of cherry tomatoes or overcooked champignons, why do the mice look like they've been unfrozen and cooked several times in their lives!
'Cause I already know there's a pretty normal white sea muddy in here!
They're served in bowls of sauce for your choice (490-560 roubles for 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauces, the one from white wine, celery and carrots, didn't really work out.
There's vegetables, and there's no smell, and if there was wine, there was still a mystery.
Well, they're good at moths with homemade mayonnaise.
Chicken water is not so thick here that depending on your mood you can decide, first or second dish in front of you, it's just a nice cream soup.
It was said that the local chef cooked the rabbit in beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
On the lookout, the situation was diametrically opposite: rosemarin overwhelmed itself.
It seemed that the rabbit had been fed exclusively with rosemary bushes in his lifetime, making the meat so incredibly smelly.
But on the other hand, the rabbit's leg was a wonderful -- no, just a great pears in a caramelized crust.
The Palm waffles offer not only sweet but also fat ones with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce was too watery and the waffles were dry.
But the manager who came to the table asked very informally about the lunch experience.
Then we should come again.
The dollar has risen to more than 37 roubles on the news of the West’s new sanctions against Russia.
It's a new historical record.
The dollar of tomorrow's calculation by 10:29 Msk grew by 26.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 roubles, and the euro rose by 30 kopecks, up to 48.73 roubles, as shown by the Moscow Exchange.
The currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the previous closure level and was worth 42.28 roubles.
Prior to Crimean events, the dollar peaked on February 19, 2009, at a cost of 36.43 roubles, and on March 3, 2014, it was 37.005 roubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is long-term, in pairs with the euro and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term prognosis presupposed this mark, says Anna Bodrova, Senior Analyst of Alpari.
Everything connected with Ukraine will be reflected in one way or another in the course.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, the rumours about the invasion of troops have not been confirmed on any side, but the market has been very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news was crossed yesterday.
The week is forecast to close around these levels at 36.90 and 37.05 roubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of the transit of gas through Ukraine is all part of the same chain.
Inflation is also projected to increase, from 5 to 10 per cent of current autumn prices.
In addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will soon be exhausted, and a vacuum will occur as the nets redirect to other suppliers.
"The dollar approached the 37 rubles mark, passed it and returned, some powerful hysterical, no," comments the head of the Market Analysis Department of "Opening Broker" Constantine Bushuev.
They will still see if the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
Ruble, he said, was severely weakened after the tax season ended, followed by news on Ukraine, and the CB stated last week that before the end of the year, it would move completely to the floating rate and refuse any foreign exchange intervention.
When you look at the day-to-day fluctuation, it's not different from the previous one during this month, and it's exactly 37 rubles that scared everyone, and the analyst continues.
Well, nothing powerful happened in terms of turnover.
The turbulent times for the currency market were, I will recall, when there was an increased demand for currency at the end of January, as well as on the third March, when the CB shipped a record amount of currency.
UFS IC also sees the positive side of weakening the ruble.
First of all, it's an increase in the revenue from export transactions, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers through import costs, says Alexei Kozlov, chief analyst of UFS IC.
The loss of imported goods and services can be attributed to the negative aspects.
The sharp fluctuations in Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, induce inflationary pressures and, as a result, lead to an increase in the cost of borrowing, which in turn impedes the development of the country’s economy.
With regard to the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble has somewhat reduced the decline in the price of shares expressed in the rubles.
For example, the MMSB index fell by 1.67% during the tendering on Thursday and the RTS index lost 3.27%.
This significant difference in the relative reduction of indices is due to the reduction of the ruble by more than 1.5 per cent during the day.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is due to a massive desire to buy a currency.
The practice has shown that the emotions are gradually eroding, and the ruble quotations partially or completely restore the lost positions.
"We believe that we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency near the level of 36 roubles to the dollar," notes Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
The British woman reported that she had spent many years thinking she would die after a misdiagnosis.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage life thinking that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had the disease of Charco-Marie-Tut, a group of hereditary disorders that cause nerve damage outside her brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosed is a common problem among people with SMT because so little is known about this condition.
Some 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are believed to have a CMT that can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, insecure walking, and squeezing toes.
Patients can feel numbness or pain, and the condition is not cured and progressing, which means that symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from the attack by Friedrich, a condition for which the prediction was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be tied to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do what the others did.
I fell every day, and it took me more time.
I've never been able to skateboard or skateboard with other kids, and I've been bullied a lot at school for walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release the Achilles tendon and straighten her legs, she looked into the medical file when her doctor left the room, and it said that she had AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose where I shouldn't, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I came home, found information about this condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I got the information back, I was shocked, and I experienced the worst panic possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I turned 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in this space.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to your life.
After a few genetic tests, she was found with a CMT.
"When he explained what SMT was, I thought I pulled out the lucky ticket," she said.
The UK SMT charity announced a month of information about the SMT to try to draw attention to the disease.
The tax burden on the entrepreneurs of the Washington Zone is increasing as the economy recovers
The recovering economy means more customers, more sales, and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax accounts for companies across the country increased moderately last year, when economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia all paid $27.6 billion to state and local treasury in fiscal year 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent over the $22.6 billion collected for 2012.
The tax burden on state and local business increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after the years after each other, when the accounts fell, in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to a study conducted by a professional service firm, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenue in the district, 56 per cent, comes from taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Maryland tax revenue comes from firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, generates the lowest tax revenues, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to the return of company real estate value, according to researchers, which raised real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years of growth of less than 1 per cent.
While large states, such as California, New York and Texas, account for a large share of these revenues, the same seems to be happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia together paid $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes last year, an increase of $9.6 billion over 2012 - a 4.2 per cent increase over the previous year.
However, the observed return of real estate value has no similar effect on the growth of state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes barely exceed one fifth of company tax accounts.
Virginia and D.C. companies pay about half of the state and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
"What happens in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around D.C., belongs either to the government or to a non-profit organization that does not pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the State Tax Center.
Thus, Maryland has to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are available in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the re-establishment of the real estate market.
Business income also seems to be improving, according to these data.
Companies in the region have declared a state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion over 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate income tax revenue, most of it in the region.
Although trends are in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase at the same rate in all three locations.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was the same as the national average, 4.3 per cent, while the growth rate in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues rose below the average of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) of 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the district it is relatively high at 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year revealed that Virginia has lower taxes on state and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favourable climate for taxes on entrepreneurs than Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from her neighbour from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing the corporate rate from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent this year, as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continues to meet its tax revenue targets next year, this law could raise the income tax rate for entrepreneurs even to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small business in the Washington area seems to be feeling better and thus paying more taxes on the state and local level, according to a recent study.
Taxes on entrepreneurs paid in the form of individual income tax by small business owners - the transition structure that most small firms operate - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia grew by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher rate of growth than taxes on entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in business tax revenues across the country are likely to continue this year, with turnover tax revenues in state and local governments rising by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may lag behind, as lower federal spending affects the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The Judo World Cup offered the Russian team two silver and seven bronze awards.
By this indicator, the Russians have only given way to Japan’s main favorite competitions.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk began on Monday, and the first day brought a silver medal to the Russian team.
Beslan wisenov, who was in the category of up to 60 kg, was the owner.
However, in the equal final struggle against Boldbat Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was only one observation received by the Russian.
On the other hand, the second day of the tournament was the most successful day for Russia, with three medals won on Tuesday.
In the men's competitions, up to 66 kg of silver was given to Mikhail Pullaev and bronze to Kamal Khan Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian gave way to the 2011 and 2013 World Champion to the Japanese Masashi Ebinume.
Han-Magomedov, who had lost a compatriot in the quarter-final stage, had won a comforting tournament and had a bronze award.
In the women's tournament, Natalia Kusutina also reached the third stage.
In the semi-final, she lost to an active world champion, Mailinda Kelmendi, from Kosovo, who played under the flag of the International Federation of Judo and successfully defended the title.
In the argument for the bronze, Kusutin won from Ma Inan from China, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that third place was not what she expected.
Once again, Kelmendi, who had defeated Kusutina earlier in the finals of the European championship, became a barrier to the Russians' journey to gold.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, the Russian team placed bronze in the reserve of Musa Magishkov, who fought in the category of up to 73 kg.
In the quarterfinal, he was abused by a former Moldovan representative, Victor Skovortsov, now serving for the UAE team.
Then, however, the Russian won two battles and became a rewarder.
Magichkov played at the home championship with a drumstick injury, which he plans to heal soon, so he'll pause in the competition.
As for ex-Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal at this tournament.
Interestingly, another fellow member of his country who accepted UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko, with bronze, completed his performance in the category of up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the FM-2014 also brought the Russians one bronze, which in the category of up to 81 kg was won by Ivan Nifontov.
In the heavy battle of the small finale, he was defeated by French man Alan Schmitt with a remark from his opponent.
On Friday, three awards were played at the tournament, but Russians traditionally confined themselves to a single bronze in a men's tournament of up to 90 kg.
It was owned by Kirill Questions, and the Russian team was guaranteed this medal: his competitor for the comforting final was Kirill Denisov.
However, the contraction did not take place: the rival questionov was unable to reach the Tatami because of the injury.
The man's bronze was won by the masters, and on the sixth day of the competition, Renat Saidov, who was in the category of over 100 kg, put into the pool.
In his comforting finale, he won a pure victory over Brazilian David Moura.
That was the end of the individual part of the world's primacy.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, Sunday, the world championships were played in team competitions.
Both Russian teams, both male and female, were among the main candidates for the awards, but, like in individual competitions, the women of the beautiful sex were unlucky - they didn't get to the medal.
But Russian judoists have won command silver.
In a decisive struggle, they gave way to the top winners of the competition, the Japanese team, in a hard fight against the score 2-3.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after the pure victory of Khan Magomedov and by the will of Denis Jartsev (up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories, Murat Habachir (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiyev (100) were unable to cope with their Japanese rivals.
In the same scenario, the bronze match in the women's tournament was developed, where the Russian 2-0 team gave way to Japanese 2-3.
The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, attended the team competitions in Chelyabinsk and congratulated the male silver team after the tournament.
"The second place is a very honorable one, but I want to say that it was clear that you could be champions," said Putin, whose words are quoted by the RIA as "News."
To lose to the Japanese, to the judo chiefs, there's nothing shameful about it.
But I'm sure you can win from them.
Russia's team at the home world championship was much better than it was a year ago at competitions of this level held in Rio de Janeiro.
At the time, the Russian team had only three medals, one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galsen and Mansour Isaiev.
We're all great maximalists, of course.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is part of the eight strongest, he's a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in a sport such as judo, the tournament was summed up by the Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation, Vitaly Mutko, whose words are quoted by the press service of the championship.
Japan’s team was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of varying dignity, five of which proved to be gold.
The next world championship will take place in the summer of next year in Astana.

Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best.
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter has expressed her hope today that an 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in her statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday, following an emergency call that she had a heart arrest at a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopie, reporting sources.
The doctors deliberately keep her under narcose and strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “heavy”.
The response was broad, including numerous Internet support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Everyone can do the kings.
The band's debut album, Royal Blood, was a new hope for British rock that brought rock duets out of the clubs straight to the stadiums.
Duoth Royal Blood has only been on stage for a year, but has already been nominated for the BBC Music Award, the Arctic Monkeys opening tour and a visit to the New York dressing room from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut single album received 100,000 pre-orders a few months before release, and the contract for its release lies in the Major label portfolio Warner Music.
Given the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation is quite remarkable, because it is not about the new Lana Del Rey or another sweet voice representative of the "new R'n'B", but about a duo of British-looking bullies playing with the volume and intensity that was last in fashion a couple decades ago.
In general, the stakes for the first album for all the above-mentioned circumstances were particularly high and have already been fully justified.
It's not for nothing that a duo took a name that could have been infringed before, except for the desperate, hairy metalists, and the blood of which kings they think are flowing in their veins, too.
Of course, it is primarily about the heroes of the past level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood is designed to shake the stagnant blood of British rock, bringing it to a new height.
It's probably a little early to predict the success of this venture, but there are some things that can be confirmed.
A dozen songs in 30 minutes are not so much a demonstration of a phenomenal composing talent as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the merits of individual numbers cannot, of course, be denied: let's say that the pilot single "Out of the Black" is characteristic of being remembered not by a melodic line, but by a drum party.
Musical jokes say it's even easier to rattle than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing record of "Better Strangers" with a Shakespeare quote in the title.
The truth, however, is that each of these songs will sound great at a heavy rock party, but when played in a row, they converge into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And it doesn't have to be bad, even the other way around.
Royal Blood's power is that they don't claim credit for the new Lennons and McCartneys (previously being targeted for Motturhead's successors), but they've brought many rock duets out of the ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, is designed for stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple thousand people, and it's obviously tight.
Part of the secret is the tricky use of bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format, invented at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
It's not just the tools, it's the way the songs are written.
The heroes of the zeros struggled to move beyond the postmodern paradigm, and were reluctant to recognize themselves as independent creative units, not just epigons.
Royal Blood is already sounding so powerful and arrogant that it has successfully tapped some of the secondaryity and hardness of the musical material.
And in the end, who said rock has to be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: an online store and video producer, and another hundred other things, buys a Twitch streaming video production service for $1.04 billion (US970 million).
This was not a surprise because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, selling Twitch to Google's video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and that combination seemed natural.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a general flow service, a YouTube version in real time.
Instead, it quickly turned into a platform where gamers broadcast their inner-game moments; "YouTube for real-time games", according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos where all-knowing people (mainly old) play games like "The Mystery Theater" are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch has been met with no particular interest, a classic example of a well-established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the YouTube deal failed, given that it was reported that he was willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from executive director Twitch Emmett Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me, who say they're better at sport than watching it, find it difficult to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking the joystick into their own hands.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3:00 a.m. when she crawls through the Resident Evil, and it's another thing to watch some stranger get 20 shots in the head in a row at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them, without controlling the angle of vision on their own, can be a recipe for headaches worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speeds in which the Rogers Bannisters of our e-center finish all the games in record time are entertaining.
But if it's not a virtual game or a humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will ever be interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, and this is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon make it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch would go to Amazon Instant Video just as elegantly as YouTube could simply absorb Twitch.
But Twitch has something that any company would love to have: a crowd of young men that advertisers dream about.
As the head of Twitch Shire, Amazon and Twitch said, "both believe in the future of the games," and this channel does not show signs of obsolescence, even - oh - as a spectacular sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed as a result of the 2004 attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to the surviving hostages -- almost all of the students now, to the parents of the dead, to the cemetery keeper - the City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, head of the committee of Mother Beslan, Susanne Doudieva, who took part in the special operation by a staff member of the MES, says Elizabeth Antonov, a correspondent of the Social Department, who worked on a special project.
Upon returning to Moscow, he met with Aslambek Aslahanov, who 10 years ago served as the President's adviser on the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with FSB's “B” officer, Vyacheslav Bocharov of Russia.”
What's really shocking for me during my work on this topic is that Beslan doesn't seem to have been in those ten years.
This subject is extremely painful for anyone who has anything to do with it, and people are hard to agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very heavy.
But you can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job," said Antonov.
A special project was developed by Rambler & Co's Infographic Holding Studio, which has been working for the company since spring.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s reign.
The DPRK launched a short-range missile
North Korea launched a short-range missile in the waters of the Japanese Sea, reports Renhap.
The launch took place around 10:30 a.m. local time from the province of Chagando, located on the border between North Korea and China.
It is assumed that the missile fell into the Japanese Sea, flying some 220 kilometres, and reported to the Joint South Korean Chiefs of Staff Committee.
The deputies suggested speeding up the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative is successful, these Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from 1 January 2015
The State Duma introduced a bill to reschedule the date of entry into force of the already adopted Law on Personal Data for Russians, from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is located in the legislative framework of the Lower House.
It was sponsored by the deputies of State Duma Vadim Dalin, Jaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeny Fedorov (Union Russia), Vladimir Parahin (Just Russia) and Alexander Yushchenko (CPRF).
This change, in the view of the proponents of the initiative, will help to ensure more quickly and effectively the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the preservation of personal data and to respect the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
A law whose entry into force is rushed by parliamentarians obliges Russians to keep their personal data on the Internet in the territory of the Russian Federation.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, store, store, refine and retrieve the personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located in Russian territory, as well as to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law empowers Roskomnadzor to restrict access to information processed in violation of the Russian legislation on personal data by a court decision.
The Act also proposes the establishment of so-called “black lists” of offending websites, an automated information system entitled “List of violators of the rights of personal data subjects”.
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The draft law was authored by Andrei Lugova and Vadim Polin of LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko of KDPF.
Money and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill to postpone the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who don't have data centers in the Russian Federation will have to pay rent.
Commenting on the bill submitted to the State Duma today, the first head of the Douma Information Policy Committee, Leonid Levin, stated that he saw no problem in moving the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
According to him, those companies that would not have their own storage facilities for Russians in the territory of the Russian Federation by 1 January 2015 would be able to rent them, for example, to Rostelecoma, who had repeatedly said that they were willing to rent their servers and were already providing their servers, to Mail Group, Western companies that were already providing their servers.
"There are also several independent data centres willing to cooperate in this field," he added.
“If companies decide to comply with the law and continue working in the territory of the Russian Federation, there is no problem - they will receive technological accommodation”, said Levin.
Disputing Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed concern that, if the bill was adopted, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
These include online booking services for airline tickets and hotels.
In the opinion of the association, “the draft law deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data, making it imperative that their recording, systematization, etc. be ensured only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to establish a mechanism to inform the user of where the recording is made, to systematize his personal data.
In such a case, it would be possible to choose the territory in which action would be taken.
The adoption of such legislation to “localize” personal data in other countries has led to the withdrawal of global services and significant economic losses.
A member of the ice water bucket test twisted her jaw
Isabelle Roberts, from Britain, screamed so hard when ice water was poured on her head, damaging the bone structure of her face.
This test with a bucket of ice water went wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed so much during the test with a bucket of ice water that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so violently when ice water was poured out on her head that her facial structure was damaged.
"Water was so cold that I yelled, but when I did it, my jaw started getting stuck," she said the Mirror.
The water's flowing to a 20-year-old.
Isabel Roberts seconds before the accident.
I tried to shut my mouth, but he didn't close, he was stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and sister had the same understanding, and they began to laugh, but I had to be taken to the emergency room immediately.
A 20-year-old woman from Britain was taken to a hospital to fix her jaw after participating in a popular hobby on Tuesday.
The video became an online sensation and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The soldiers handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The Army of Novorossia claims to have hit Ukrainian Su-27 and accused the enemy of violating the cease-fire agreement.
As at 10 a.m. on 1 September, the militia handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
Interfax was informed by a representative of the press service of the Army of Novorossia.
He added that “by air defence forces in the area of Mereska, Su-27 aircraft were shot down, violating ceasefire agreements”.
According to the Agency ' s interlocutor, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions when shelling Lugano airport.
The spokesman for the press noted that the militia had managed to damage two Ukrainian air force helicopters at one of the field airfields overnight, as well as to destroy two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
“The casualties in the enemy's life — up to a hundred dead and wounded — were surrendered to 13 prisoners”, summed up by the staff representative.
Interfax has no evidence of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed groups of the “people's republics” of Donbassa announced that 223 prisoners and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine had been handed over to the Ukrainian side as part of the ceasefire regime.
At the same time, at night, the NPD army, according to the Army of Novorossia, “stopped an attempt by the National Guards to remove heavy equipment from the surrounding area, in violation of previous agreements”.
At that time, the militia reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 military personnel.
According to the headquarters, the total enemy casualties in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariupol) during that night amounted to five tanks, eight armoured combat vehicles, and more than 120 people were killed and wounded.
At the end of the past week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers were surrounded by militias in the Ilowaysk area of Donetsk province.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the leadership of the “people's republics” to release Ukrainian troops from their surroundings.
In the DNR, they agreed to do so on the condition that the enemy surrendered arms and ammunition.
The first dozen soldiers began to leave the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion, Donbass, Semen Semenchenko, another 14 people left the Cotla on Sunday night.
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded were "in captivity to 137 regiments of 32 divisions of the Russian Federation and 9 tanks of the Russian Federation" where they were treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence of Russia denied reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO of the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Russia will respond if the EU imposes new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take measures to protect its legitimate interests in the event of the imposition of new anti-Russian sanctions, as reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
A report from the Russian Foreign Diplomacy Department states that the “conclusions” of the European Council of 30 August demonstrated the inability of EU member countries to overcome the inertia of their unspeakable support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine on the basis of “absolutely unsubstantiated allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of that country”, as stated on the website of the agency.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation regrets that the Euro Council, contrary to the interests of its member States, is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in intensifying confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as for a fully fledged “dialogue between the belligerents”, emphasizes the agency.
The agency ' s website also notes that there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbassa, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has taken place, as well as an increasing number of civilian casualties.
We recall that specific proposals on sanctions against the Russian Federation are planned for the next seven days in the European Union.
At the same time, EU representatives cooperate closely with United States officials.
They are expected to correlate the measures imposed by the period of operation and the degree of severity.
New EU sanctions can affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an increase in sanctions against Russia in the areas of defence, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Although the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon be in second grade, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books from seniors, offering them nominal compensation to postpone their sale.
"My math book, which is usually $180, I got a semester for $10 and a cookie for "Chick-fil-A," says Schroeder, who's 19 years old at the College Covenant in Georgia.
The necessary literature for the last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120 dollars.
According to the College Board, the average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and study supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing Internet stores and creative ideas like Schroeder's system.
The rental of books is becoming more popular, allowing students to use the book for a semester, and often is much cheaper than buying it.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookshops, reports that book rentals have doubled since 2011.
Industry studies show that about a quarter of the books in university bookshops during the last spring semester were rented, says the vice president of Nibo, Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookshops, according to the professional association National Association of University Stores.
Here's an induction course on how best to make a good deal.
Buying on the Internet
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one third of what you see at the university bookstore.
The ninth edition of Mathematical Analysis by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is about $290 on the price list, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on the website of Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of used goods
If you don't mind someone else's marks or injuries, used textbooks are a good option.
Mathematical Analysis is sold for $93.49 in second-hand form on Chegg.com.
Matt Kasadei, 25 years old, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents for Amazon.com for a second-hand copy of the textbook "Strategic Solutions in Media: Understanding the Business of Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers such as Ingrid Bracy, director of the College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, asks students to ask their professors if previous publications can be used.
Sometimes updates are not relevant to classes.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small proportion of the value of the last edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative for the purchase of used books.
Rent
You should think about renting textbooks if you treat them well enough, you don't forget to return them, and you don't want to keep them after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of the new book.
For example, one student was able to rent Mathematical Analysis for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you get the books, including any fines you might get for markings, highlightings, and damage.
If you rent a book, remember that if you do not return the book, fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
Electronic books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
At times, such books are leased by e-licensing for a certain period from distributors, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematic Analysis" on Chegg.com will cost about $61 for six months.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the best prices, as many classical works can now be downloaded free of charge, while literature in natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look around.
Joe Galt, 29 years old, who is about to start at Pepperdin Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to determine the price of the book, as it guarantees that you are looking for the text you need.
Before ordering on the Internet, Galt says, make sure that the book is actually in the warehouse.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he bought was postponed for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin stated that the Far East Development Fund was completely inefficient
Russia’s President Vladimir Putin pointed out at a meeting on the governance of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, was inefficient, reports Interfax.
"15 billion roubles remained on deposit," stressed the President.
During the meeting, the Head of State requested that the approval of the list of pre-development Territories in the Far East be expedited.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of the TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, noted the President, never approved the list of pre-development territories in the Far East and their criteria until 1 July.
Vladimir Putin also outlined the main challenges for the development of the Far East.
These include improving the region ' s transport accessibility and removing infrastructure restrictions, both in the domestic market and for export development.
Among other things, there is a need to create preconditions for attracting additional investment to the region, as well as to create pre-development areas that should become competitive with the key business centres of APR, stressed by the President.
We recall that it has been previously reported that the pre-development territory could replace the NEO.
Why the Guards of the Galaxy couldn't save the cashier's fees?
Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million from her $90 million budget in the United States, while "City of Sins: The Woman for Who Kills" returned only $12 million from her $70 million budget.
Home Videos with Cameron Diaz brought only $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's films like "How to tame Dragon 2" also disappoint the profits.
The Telegraph article by Robbie Colleen points out that when it comes to children's movies, it may be about the poor quality of the films themselves.
Colleen called 2014 the "worst" year in the history of children's films and called "How to tame Dragon 2" a barely "functioning" continuation of fantasy.
However, when it comes to films directed to a slightly older audience, the problem does not necessarily appear to be the film itself.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic each film that was rented in the summer with at least 2,000 copies between the Memorial Day celebrations in May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the views of both film viewers and critics, suggest that this year’s film harvest is similar to last year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that this may be about changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of streaming Internet services, such as Netflix.
Directed by John Favro, who is currently working on the soon-to-rent Disney film "The Book of the jungle" said to Hollywood Reporter's website, "I think times are changing."
We must recognize that and not try to pursue what was before.
Unlike the current fall in cash charges in Hollywood, Netflix's income from the streaming replication service reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Stephen Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book franchises, and foretelling Hollywood's red.
In the light of the current recession, some commentators claim that there was truth in his gloomy predictions.
In view of the fact that several potential cashier hits are expected in the summer of 2015, including the Avengers: The Ages of Altron, the Minions and the Jura Park, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
Producer Simon Kinberg recently called the drop of cash charges "cyclical," saying Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the most cashy summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Product sanctions do not frighten the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants in Europe and Japan, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
Generally speaking, the general public still prefers to replace banned imports with products from Latin America, Israel, and China, not from Russia.
"Better there is a low-salt cucumber than a bad mozzarella," lamented the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio about the quality of cheese offered to him by suppliers in exchange for Italians.
Mozzarella and burrat cheese ended at the restaurant first, and they're short-lived.
Parmesan supplies should be enough for a couple more months.
What do we do?
Go to Russian?
In 2005, I was at the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear that shocking memories do not let him go until now.
There was meat on the carts just 30 centimeters from the floor!
It's cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant, we would never buy anything in Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe things have changed now.
But the other day, they brought me fish from the Far East for a test.
So it turned out to be bad!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many of the usual things for Italy are for a Russian manufacturer in wildness.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in a refrigeration chamber for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It's got to hang out to be soft, so the muscles can relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get this tender meat?"
I told you, it's yours, Russians!
Why doesn't anyone do that to you?
At five minutes' walk from Barlotti at the French restaurant Brassery Bridge, there's a stop-list in the kitchen showing the missing products: the French oysters, the sea oysters.
The chef of the Brassery Bridge restaurant and the Arrow bar, Régis Trigel, is less pessimistic than Valerio: oysters from France have already replaced oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
And Régis is more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Blue cabbage: 200 roubles!
I'm like, "Why, on what basis is it worth so much?"
They say, "Well, we have to make money too."
But this cabbage shouldn't be worth more than 80 rubles!
We buy long east oysters by weight, but they live 15 to 20 years, you know how much their shell weighs?
The price is that it's superdelicates.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of terror for foreign cooks.
Standard story: "The first three months were fine, then quality fell sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibre and quality.
Many restaurants in Europe don't know what's going to happen to them when they run out of cheese.

Sanctions Menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure Russian security, mostly called food sanctions.
The importation of beef, pork, meat and co-products from poultry, meat delicacies, fish, clams, milk, yogurts, tomatoes, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups is prohibited.
The restaurants have started to have a Chekhardt with suppliers: the prices of the products have risen, and it is urgent to look for analogies from other countries.
This will have the greatest impact on expensive restaurants with monocookies in France, Italy, Spain, where products were supplied directly from “materian” countries.
The general public had to be rebuilt before.
For example, when Rosselhoznadzor banned the importation of Australian beef in early 2014, and a year earlier, American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers made deliveries of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But summer 2014 sanctions have proved to be far more severe.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which ban Atlantic salmon and trout, non-lactoise milk, seed potatoes, sugar maize, peas and onions for planting.
Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can be reduced.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist under conditions of uncertainty.
According to East West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imports in the bonus segment was up to 70 per cent.
"Dear restaurants will have to change the menu to what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergey Mironov, the restator, the owner of Restconsult.
If the chef is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we have very few cooks like this, and it could take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from Brassery Bridge is ready for this: 10-15% of the dishes will have to go away, half the menu will have to be reworked.
In mixed kitchen restaurants, foods like marble beef steak are already being replaced by beef strogans, says Sergey Mironov.
“The cheeses from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Chile, Tunisia, Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of East West.
The cream and dairy products from Europe are similar in Russia and Belarus.
A chicken from the United States can be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, a salmon and a seed from Norway — salmon, samga, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of European vegetables and fruits can be offset by domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget network restaurants would be more easily rebuilt than the bonus segment: there were hardly gourmets who could distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian.
Although it's gonna be hard for Ginza Projects, he thinks.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with its own menus.
It's gonna take a lot of time to replace," says Mironov.
In Ginza, the comments were rejected, citing the absence of owners in the country.
The owners of Caucasian and Central Asian cafés emphasize that products from former Soviet republics are more aromatic than European foods.
But there are many restaurants that the sanctions will hardly touch.
These include institutions in the kitchen of CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in the Georgian kitchen," says Khatuna Kolbay, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the "Wai Me!" Café.
All the cheeses are made for us in Russia, which is the basis of many dishes - chicken fillet, exotic green we don't use."
No dishes have yet been removed from the menu in the institutions of Kolbai.
Timura Lanski, the owner of Chaichon N1 restaurants with Uzbek kitchens, the sanctions don't bother either, he'll only have to change lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia were to import from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we would even win the price, it would be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he said.
You can get cheaper cuts, lambs, tomatoes, cucumbers, and fruits from the CIS.
However, what comes from Central Asia is much better than the plastics from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
We all know about Uzbek tomatoes that they're delicious, sweet.
No one says that about Spanish.
Following the imposition of the sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of the Interior of Uzbekistan, Olimboy Artykov, stated that he planned to double the export of fruit-bearing products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan declared their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
The fast food restaurants that responded to the "Deneg" request also react fairly calmly to the sanctions.
McDonald's press stated that localization exceeded 85% and the network worked with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of Subway Russia's supplier department, about 80 per cent of the products are purchased by the network in Russia, although the supply of vegetables and the price of meat products produced from imported raw materials may be time-consuming.
In Teremka, “sanctionary products” accounted for no more than 4 per cent.
They didn't touch the sanctions or the Vokker noodle.
KFC, Burger King and Little Potato did not respond to the "Deneg" request, but other market participants argue that Burger King is significantly less localized than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, the rest moratoriums are willing to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far East.
On his humpback.
For the time being, the moratoriums have complained that prices are rising even for local products due to increased demand.
“The average price for Grabley products rose between 10 and 15 per cent, and for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio twice,” says the restator Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of the dishes will rise by 5-10%, admits Kolbay.
East-West does not deny this: “For example, Belarusian dairy products have cost 10-15% since early August.”
"The Brazilian suppliers almost doubled the price of pork," complains Sergey Rak, Deputy Director General Stardogs.
Chicken ham cost 35%.
Waiting for China's prices, maybe they'll cool off the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned price increase of 8 per cent.
Now it's very undesirable to raise prices, says Cancer.
According to statistics, the increase in general service revenues in the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest indicator since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is not clear how fast it is: as long as most retortortors have stored their products for the next two months in the hope of waiting for the swings in purchasing prices.
But what happens in two months, nobody knows.
There are ten tents in front of Moscow City Hall, decorated with green and wood.
In the middle of the scene, musicians play waltz.
It's a regional food festival with the fun name "There's Time."
"We were going to make a local food party a long time ago, "and then the sanctions, "we rushed, organized a festival," says one of the organizers.
Behind the scene with the musicians, the Greek cook Anastas is making macaroni salad and homemade candy, and the other day there was a master class of borsche with caramelized apples.
All Russian products, tell the organizers.
In tents, an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian people's economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, deer from Salehard, vegetables from the Lenin Sovhoza, cheeses from the swamped Italian Jay Clouse.
"A salmon for restaurants can be easily replaced by another fish of salmon from the Far East," says the owner of his own fish shop, Philippe Galkin.
We've got nerks, kettles, cucumbers, boobs, chavs, royal salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon because it's a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take him in your hands, he doesn't even move.
And you can't hold our far east salmon.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace Italian mozzarella with domestic
In the window of his tent are shrimps with a tag called Magadan, cod, omul, muzzle, meadows from Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin's sure it's time to move on to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, fish catches in Russia in 2013 are over 4 million tons, and a large proportion of fish go to Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are about 800,000 tons.
Own People has been working since 2012, selling fish through an Internet store, serving a dozen more restaurants, such as "Simple Things" before the sanctions were imposed.
Now, Galkin has received applications from 15 other restaurants.
The same sushi can be made of our fish, he's hot.
We've had a bit of trouble, tried a lot of prescriptions.
We're selling sushi through an Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish are cheaper a few times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
As a confirmation in Galkin's tent, I'm getting a portion of Philadelphia with a keta.
Unlike samga rolls, they have to chew longer, but the realization that this fish is our domestic fish gives us strength.
There's even halibut rolls and sea bass on their own people's website.
In sushi bars, however, the replacement of Norwegian salmon is preferable to Chilean salmon.
Galkin explains this because cooks are lazy to come up with new recipes for long-eastern fish.
"Russia fish suppliers haven't offered us yet," explains the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitri Eusev.
The situation is similar with other products: Russian producers could have occupied a free niche, but this is not the case.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project, Boris Akimov, it is now possible to talk about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and large volumes.
They can quickly replace banned imports, unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will benefit first and foremost the major producers of other countries,” says Akimov.
In the last month, however, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
Following mass unplanned checks, three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
“We are examining the nature of the claims filed to determine the actions required for the early opening of restaurants for visitors”, stated “the money” in the McDonald's press service.
No one really knows what's going to happen.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, it's one option that can be survived, an anonymously speaking employee of the restaurant consulting company.
But if they start closing McDonald's all over the country, the script will be completely different.
Europrotocol instead of HIDB certificate
Casco payments can be received without being certified by HICCD, so the CB intends to encourage the introduction of the Europrotocol in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed draft guidelines according to which, as of 1 September of this year, an insured motorist will be able to do without a certificate from HICD in order to obtain a cash flow payment.
It is true that this is only a case where the accident was documented on a Europrotocol without the involvement of the traffic police.
So if there were only two cars involved, there were no physical injuries, the damage did not exceed the limit, and both drivers agreed on who was responsible for the accident.
As of 2 August, the europrotocol ceiling is 50,000 roubles, and as of 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be increased to 400,000 roubles.
The point is that often even in minor injuries, in a situation where an accident can be handled by a “europrotocol”, drivers who have been involved in an accident call DPS.
Because if there was a casco policy, it was not possible to obtain compensation for it without a certificate from HICD.
The parameters set out in the draft directive are intended to remove this obstacle to the introduction of the Europrotocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment for the casco for accidents processed without HIED staff should not be lower than the limit for the Europrotocol.
At the same time, however, it cannot be above the limit set out in the casco insurance policy.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically capable of unloading both the DPS and the roads.
But it's probably not going to make the motorists or the insurers happy.
The latter already point to the serious threat of increased fraud, which could be caused by the introduction of new rules for payment of the helmet.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
The driver will most of the time wait for an inspector to take care of a minor accident because it's more reliable.
And we don't know if it's gonna be easier to beat crooks or convince drivers of the reliability of the Europrotocol.
Saving certificate will make nameless and irrevocable
The Ministry wants to ban bearer certificates of savings, but will allow banks to make them the equivalent of irrevocable deposits.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will prohibit bearer savings certificates.
Recently, this tool has gained popularity because the stakes here are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that savings certificates for bearer are not included in the deposit insurance system and are cheaper for the bank because there is no need to contribute to the deposit insurance agency (RAA).
The picnicity of the situation is that this step is planned because of small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, but will be affected by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which are estimated to control 98 per cent of the relevant market.
The Bank of Moscow is estimated to account for about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained in the ASA, is that the customers of a small bank who have purchased such a certificate, if their license is revoked, are trying to obtain money from the ASA.
Some investors may assume that their investments are insured, with insufficient financial literacy and savings certificates for bearer.
A reasonable lack of insurance payments for these certificates, if the bank withdraws its licence, may lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency, there were instances in which bearer certificates sought to recover insurance through the court”, the ASA stated.
The problem, of course, is inconceivable.
After all, no one will pay the buyers of certificates, as they have no legal right to compensation from the State.
If the instrument had not been insured in the ASA, metal accounts in which citizens ' funds were recorded in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium - would have been banned along with it.
These accounts are not included in the deposit insurance system either, but their existence has not yet been attempted.
It is likely that bearer certificates are a very convenient securities that can actually be a quasi-denegue.
However, their movement is virtually uncontrollable: any bank customer can buy a certificate, hand over to any citizen, and before cashing the certificate, a large number of owners can change.
It is no coincidence that the bill prescribes that the savings certificate must be the name of the securities to be kept in the depository.
And to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed without early payment.
That is, the analogy of irrevocable contributions that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Nyport and Cardiff
There were protests this weekend by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for what was described as antisummit.
Stephen Fairklow followed the events for us during the weekend and spoke to protesters from all over, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will supply arms to Iraq to counter militants from the Islamic State terrorist group, reporting ITAR-TASS on 31 August, referring to the decision taken at the meeting of representatives of the Government of Germany, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reported to send 30 Milan portable anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
The deliveries will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it has been decided to allocate an additional 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will deliver a government statement in the Bundestag on this subject.
So far, Germany has not supplied its weapons to hot spots.
The views of the people of the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the transfer of weapons to the Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop fighters from the Islamic State, others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militia hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
The Donets militia bombed a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reporting ITAR-TASS on 31 August.
This was reported to have occurred in the Taganrog Bay near the towns of Chirokino and Benomyno (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reports that two coast guard boats have been fired at.
It is clear that the incident took place today around 16:20 msk.
Teenagers were taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
TWO youths were taken by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went camping shortly after noon at Gowetts Lip in Blackhit.
The concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team comprising local police and rescue teams was dispatched, and a couple were found around 11 p.m. near the Bridal Vale Falls.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell down and hit his head.
The officers stayed with a couple for the night, and they were picked up at the winch on Monday morning.
They were taken in an ambulance in stable condition to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two unions met.
The Minsk summit talks did not resolve the problems for which they were convened but created a new format: the first European Union persons met with the first persons of the future Eurasian
Even on a disturbing occasion (the situation around Ukraine does not tolerate delay), EU and Customs Union leaders discussed for the first time a number of “hot problems”.
Whether such a structure can work effectively is unclear; however, it is clear who removed the cream from this summit.
Questions in this regard fell off the evening of August 26, when the Belarusians, followed by other Eurasians and Europeans, saw the new President Lukashenko on television.
The Belarusian leader set an example of a well-defined courtesy, it was the behavior of a man who just blew up a jackpot -- and planned a decent old age in a higher society.
How Maidan Lukashenko helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to address the final briefing on their behalf, not just the legitimization of the President with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full subject of European politics and as the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The Senior Analyst of the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies, Denis Meljantsov, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to speak to Minsk in the same manner as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met the Tet-a-tet with Lukashenko suggests that relations with the EU will continue to be defrosted," he said, "the fire."
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparation for a breakthrough by the Belarusian authorities began well before the November Maidan in Kiev, in the summer of 2013.
“The results have been achieved, and with the EU – successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, modernization dialogues – the Fire interviewer has been listed – and international security negotiations have been held with the US.
The States even lifted some sanctions.
With regard to the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reactions of the leaders of Belarus have only encouraged the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure rejected Crimea’s accession to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militia in Donbassa with all its severity, did not fight with Moscow.
Minsk has not withdrawn from the Customs Union or the CSTO, and the Russian airbase is located in Baranović.
Brussels and Washington noticed Minsk’s balanced position on the Ukrainian issue, and they appreciated it, as the Belarusian experts were sure.
As much as Lukashenko’s movement towards political diversification is successful, it will be evident how often Minsk will soon have to host EU+TC meetings.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond quickly to questions about what Brussels expects of relationships in a new format.
The Spokesman Ashton Maya Kosyančić merely stated to the “Fire” that the issue of war and peace was not a priority.
It was reported that Kazakhstan could also be the next venue for a meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the first persons in the new format.
A drop of degth for Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he had been asked personally by the EU.
However, in the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties would not object to Minsk being the central venue for meetings both in the Russian-OSCE-Ukraine format and at the level of heads of State and high-level representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” is becoming a fully handcuffed European leader who is helping to solve the global problem.
Best friend of a European farmer
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Trade and Energy Commissions, led to the conclusion that the main theme of the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbassa, but the economy.
Indeed, the meeting ' s timetable for future gas negotiations and for overcoming the concerns of TC countries under the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU is more ambitious than the peace declaration without specific dates and figures.
The Trade Commissioner, Karl De Gucht, nevertheless pointed out that the EU representatives “come to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis that has economic consequences rather than vice versa”.
It seems, however, that the crisis in Ukraine also “works” for Belarus.
Its consequences — and above all, the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia — are given to Minsk, who, for the time being, is experiencing the sanctions pressure, the long-awaited space for manoeuvre.
According to the head of the Mises Research Centre, former presidential candidate for Belarus, Jaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are keenly interested in the ability of Belarus to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation without sanctions.
In doing so, supply schemes are being proposed for which Vladimir Putin at the summit blew up Minsk.
“The initiators of these schemes,” stressed Romanchuk “The Fire”, are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out supply schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and these schemes have now been destroyed.
Russian business urgently needs to recover them somehow, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, relates to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are willing to start production in Belarus of Ukrainian raw materials also with a Russian market orientation.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes may now be very needed.”
Romanchuk believes that the role of the host of the EU and TC negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and for the development of economic ties with Europe.
He recalled that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from the Moscow sanctions were estimated at Euro5-10 billion, while the European Commission was currently offering only Euro125 million to the farmers.
The Belarusian president can invite Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for the Eurofarmers.
This could raise the credibility of Lukashenko in the EU to unprecedented heights.
Hostage without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the irony is that the official Minsk is disassociating itself from its active role in the birth of the TS+EC format, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague stressed that Kyiv was the initiator of the new format.
“It was your offer to gather, without any trouble, to discuss, not from the bay, to decide, after signing the Treaty of Association with the EU, to understand the situation that was currently taking place in Ukraine,” he addressed the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.
The observers, however, interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, reportedly initially opposed Minsk's mediation, which greatly increased its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic department, it is carefully emphasized that Belarus, in organizing EU-TC interaction on its land, does not pursue self-interest and the ultimate goal of such a format is to create a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
“It is entirely in the spirit of the concepts that, in other areas, particularly in the area of security, have put forward and promoted the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation”, said “Fire” in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, an agency that has recently carefully chosen words.
In Moscow, there may be zones of paid entry.
The Government of Moscow considers the introduction of pay-for-entry zones as a method to combat congestion in central roads similar to other major cities in the world, transmitting M24.ru with reference to the Moscow Deputy Mayor for Transport, Maxim Liksutov.
One option that has proved to be successful is fee-paying entry.
It's an expert opinion, we're going to study it, we're going to look at all the negatives and the positives.
To say that some decisions have been made on this matter, it is still early,' told the Lixuts.
The Deputy Mayor stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar to Moscow in structure and complexity, is very important to the capital.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the construction of the central ring road already under way, adding the Lixuts.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there were sufficient bypass infrastructure, there was no need for transit traffic in Moscow,” said the mayor.
Maxim Lixutov also claimed that the introduction of the parking lot had significantly unloaded the capital streets.
And he said that the capital authorities did not plan to stop at what they had achieved.
On 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergey Sobianin, participated in the ceremony of the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CADA).
Boring Sinable
Frank Miller's and Robert Rodriguez's film "City of Sins 2: The Woman for Whom it Is to Kill" made a completely different revolution than he'd expect.
The first "City of Sin" (2005), filmed with minimal but symbolic participation by Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between film, comics, and literary nuar.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the basic modern thinking chain of "thesis-antithesis-synthesis" (as defined by the concept of the universe of the nuar and the antithesis of the space of comics).
From now on, it should read "thesis - antithesis - chaos".
The City of Sin 2 is chaotic on both dramatic and philosophical levels: both times it is chaotic in a bad way.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the first City, although, here, the big man Marv (Mickey Rourke) remembers, ended his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, only makes it possible to pick up, as a traditional maid of honor, knives and other axes with strangulations.
But old people are literally pushed with their elbows by newcomers, like they're in town from some other movie, the meaning and story of which the audience is asked not to worry.
So, his story, shamelessly shattered by the authors at the most interesting place, by the super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Hers is for the lustful freegid Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something avenging Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion in which Dwight, let's say, face-to-face is not different from Johnny -- especially since faces like other parts of the body are being shattered to characters with inexorable regularity -- is no trouble or even half trouble.
They're not humans, we know they're the Noara archetypes: a fateful bitch, a self-confidenced player who's caught in a honey trap of sex, detective, a corrupt senator.
Well, when an archetype waltzes with an archetype and an archetype chases, it's not a movie, but an abstract painting.
And it's funny to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the story.
Besides, even in this turbulent world, there's something permanent.
Fighting whores from the first City continue to hold a circular defense against the dark forces that besiege their hometowns.
And Detective Hartigan's ghost isn't there, and he's gonna look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem with City of Sin 2 is another.
Frank Miller was good because as a drawer talentedly combined a comic book and a nuar, and as a director, he turned the idea of how to move comics to the screen.
Comics and noir are two aggressively opposite "realities."
The contemporary comic book phenomenon was born in the late 1920s, at the same time as the novels of Dashil Hammet "Blood Harvest" (1929), "Maltic Falcon" (1930) and "Glass Key" (1931) created a canon of nuar, then known as hard-boiled school.
Or pulp fiction.
The comedians gave Hollywood dozens of heroes: from Popey's sailor, the spinach eater, giving him the rich power, Superman, Batman, and stinging Dick Tracy to Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other "revenors."
But in any comic book movie, there was something wrong: the painted characters persistently refused to grow up with screen flesh, remained pretending to be in the real world around them.
Simply put, they were completely devoid of "existence."
Noir, on the other hand, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After world wars, the traditional novel - with experiences, personalities, family scandals and historical backgrounds - lost all credibility.
What are the Forsythes, which Tibo and Rugon McCarre, what are the Bolkons and Rostovs even thinking after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated into a soap opera, and the criminal - that is, marginal - novel rose to the level of a philosophical prose.
Hammet found out in his own skin what it's like to work as a paramedic on the front.
He was a communist.
As was, by the way, at least close to the company and the genre pillars of Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassen, Joseph Lawzy, Edward Dmitrick.
So the noir, the archetype of which they set, is, firstly, rude and cynical, and secondly, purely social.
It's almost an American version of socialism.
The first City of Sin was remarkable precisely because it was unnatural, but organically connected the comic to the nuar.
For the first time on the screen, the comic came to life with no shyness in his graphic nature, not pretending to be a real movie.
The dream of a corrupt world where the cardinal ordered the murders, and the senator covered the monstrous sadist son, was worthy of Hammet's pen.
And the paintings are like the heads cut off by the sadist decorating his nest, the pen of the brilliant James Elllroy, the author of the Black Orchid, and the best -- that is, the declarative nausea, the Neonur representative.
"City of Sin Two" is not even a retreat, but a surrender of Miller-Rodriges' radical style to the comic book tradition.
It must have happened in a lot of ways because of 3D technology.
When you watch the second City of Sin, you feel trapped in a glass ball where the snow falls asleep in a toy claw.
Most often, though, it's not snow, it's blood shackles, but basically, what's the difference?
Well, there's nothing to say about socialism.
I mean, it's only possible when somewhere, somewhere we have, sometimes on the side of a dirty swamp, but there's a normal world where you can get a girl back on the curve or, say, sad parents, that her destroyer is punished.
But when there is no place for sin in the city except sin, there is no sin, but a standard.
Boring as any standard.
Chaos City of Sin Two is boring.
For the sake of justice, the domestic rental gave this fresh sin a small but pepper.
The titles warn: The film contains harmful smoking scenes.
With respect to the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode of which a man's fingers are torn, it gives him hellish humor.
Hammet would love it.
French socialists have to "shut up and clean France," says Frasua Holland's key ally.
Mr. Valle called upon the deeply divided left forces to “exemplify the warmth” of the attacking socialist president whose reshuffles were not approved by the vast majority of French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay with him," he said, voicing applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured that his Government would not call into question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite inflammatory proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland begged his fellow Socialist Party members to remain “single” with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, the Minister of Justice, put the sticks in the wheel, bringing the Socialist Party to a meeting of dissenting members of Parliament and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lost their faith in the future”.
Marín Le Pé, leader of the extreme right-wing National Front, expressed contempt for the ongoing internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she did not realize that the new Wall’s government would last longer than a few months.
François Hollande is a naked king, but a naked and Prince Manuel Valle, forced to gather a new government when the previous summer failed.
"And the new one won't last the fall or the winter," said Mrs. Le Pen to the reporters.
She reiterated her party ' s call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that she was convinced that the party could easily win early elections and was ready to run.
The ruling French party survived the defeat of the March municipal elections, and the extreme right-wing National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A Sunday Journal du Dimanche poll found that 76 per cent of the French believed that the Socialist Party was at risk of disintegration into several rival factions before the end of Mr. Holland's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at the University of Xianx Po, warned that the French would quickly lose their patience if the new socialist government failed to correct the economy and record unemployment.
"He doesn't have much time, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"The City Without Drugs" is without a lawsuit.
The Sverdlovsky Court of Arbitration dismissed the claim by the Regional Department of Public Property Management for the City without Drugs Foundation.
The agency intended to recover more than 7 million rubles from the organization as rent for a building in the centre of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff failed to appear in court twice.
Today, the Sverdlovsky Regional Court of Arbitration dismissed the claim of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the Region (IGISO) against the City without Drugs Foundation (one of the founders is the Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Eugenius Roysman).
The regional authorities intended to recover 7.3 million roubles from the organization as rent for the building.
It is now known that the plaintiff did not appear before the court twice, which is why the decision to refuse the hearing was made.
The reason for the absence of representatives from the Directorate of IUGSO could not be explained, and the head of the Legal Division, Maxim Titov, did not respond to the telephone calls.
Nor was it possible to contact the representatives of the Fund.
To recall, this is a mansion that occupied a foundation in the city centre on Belinsky Street, 19 on a donation basis since 2011.
This decision was made by ex-Governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Department of Public Property Management of Sverdlovsk Region filed a claim with the Sverdlovsky Arbitration Tribunal for the eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the action, the agency requested, through the court, that the non-contained contract of free use be declared the residence of the memorial mansion.
According to the Directorate of IIGISO, the agreement did not include substantial terms for the lease of the cultural heritage.
The Sverdlov arbitral tribunal dismissed the claim, at which time an appeal was filed with the 17th arbitral tribunal, Permi, which was granted.
The fund then filed an appeal against the decision in cassation with the same court, which was not upheld, after which the decision was appealed by the fund to the Supreme Court of Arbitration, but the court accepted the directorate.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was concluded, under which the fund again began paying rent, as told by the head of the city, Eugenius Roysman.
The rent was set at 300,000 roubles per month.
The previous administration of the region has donated this building to us, recognizing our anti-drug credit, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration has decided differently,” he stated.
Tatiana Drogojeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the Mayor of Yekaterinburg was asked to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, the deputy of Catherinenburg, Aleksandr Kosintsev, invited the mayor of the city, Speaker of the Gordum, Eugenius Roysman, to resign.
The criminal case involved a person arrested on suspicion of the murder of a retired deputy, Oleg Keenev, who was considered a fellow mayor.
How Eugenia Roysman was found in a criminal case
On 1 July, it was reported that a criminal case had been opened for “leak” (article 128.1 of the Criminal Code) on the blog of Mayor Yekaterinburg Evgeny Royzman.
This was reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlovsk region by Anna Filatov, Director of the Defence Law Centre.
According to her, Mr. Royzman accused her of blogging her of being involved in the crimes her ex-husband allegedly committed.
Mayor Catherineburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone will turn into a wallet
In the run-up to 9 September, when Apple is due to present its new designs, the press is seeing more leaks about what can be expected from the presentation.
According to United States media sources, the sixth generation of iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint Apple project and payment systems of Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and Specialized Internet Resources Re/code, Apple can, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express at the launch of new products on 9 September, making the new iPhone 6 smartphone available as a mobile wallet function.
Companies themselves refuse to comment on this matter.
This function allows payment to be made on the shop's cash register by means of a smartphone.
The user will identify the payment by fingerprinting using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will first incorporate NFC technology, which allows for a non-contact payment using a smartphone and an appropriate reader on the cash register.
The NFC technology itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC function was first introduced in 2004 as part of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that joined the so-called NFC Forum, an association to promote this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with the NFC function, Samsung Nexus S, was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced a Google Wallet system that allows users to tie bank cards to their Google account and pay with a smartphone on Android.
However, United States experts emphasize that despite the large investment of high-tech companies in promoting NFC technology, United States retailers are still cautious about innovation and are not willing to spend money on the equipment of their shops with such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple’s entry into this market will still force the Ritellers to accelerate and intensify the introduction of this technology in their outlets.
French Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Paris's position on the delivery to Russia of “Mistralei” is unchanged
The official representative of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Roman Nadal, stated that Paris's position regarding the supply to Russia of Mistral-type helicopters was unchanged.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Holland) in an interview with Le Monde on 20 August: "Today, the level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This is the decision of Europeans, not France," quotes Mr. Nadal "RIA News."
Thus, the representative of the French foreign policy department replied to the question whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the change in the position of Paris to implement the contract.

National Security Council of Ukraine: seven soldiers lost their lives in the area of force operations in the past 24 hours
The representative of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Andrey Lysenko, reported that seven Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and another 25 injured in the area of combat in the east of the country over the past 24 hours.
The situation under Ilawisk is extremely difficult.
No details will be made available until the withdrawal operation is completed.
At the end of the operation, the losses and causes of the situation will be disclosed.
Those responsible for such a situation will be held accountable,” Mr. Lysenko added, refusing to discuss the situation in more detail under Ilowaysk, where several Ukrainian battalions are surrounded.
According to the representative of the SNBO, “every effort is being made to return the soldiers who have been captured”, reports ITAR-TASS.
Mr. Lysenko also noted that the Ukrainian military had departed from Lugansk airport in the direction of Giorgiyevka.
For more information on the situation in eastern Ukraine, read "OJ" by Arsen Awakov: the first Ukrainian military has left the area of Ilowaysk.
The Norwegian Cruise is approaching a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises.
The Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stage of negotiating the acquisition of a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc., for about $3 billion, according to people who are familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to cruise ships of the “Lux” class and secured clients of Prestige Cruzes, as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CL.N).
The agreement could be announced this week, sources informed on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
Prestige Cruises, a private investment company, Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
Sources asked to remain unnamed because the negotiations were not open.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruzes did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, manages 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 per cent over 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, works under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships that travel to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She announced a $1.2 billion income in 2013, 6 percent higher than a year earlier.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in subsequent years from the growth of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.
The competition companies seek to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for the first public holding of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's main shareholder after a $850 million deal in 2007.
The Norwegian Cruise was created as it now exists in 2000 as a result of a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and a casino under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thei.
Apollo invested $1 billion in the Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
The Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned a share of 28 per cent, Apollo owned a share of 20 per cent, and a private investment company, TPG Capital LP, owned a share of 8 per cent in the company, as reported at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of cruise passenger traffic in North America, according to registration documents for the first public posting of Prestige Cruises.
Crimea Radio Company can receive 250 million roubles of subsidies
In Mincoms Russia, it is proposed that 250 million roubles be allocated to Crimea's state television and radio company in 2014.
As indicated in the draft Mincom-Community Regulation, which is available on a single regulatory disclosure portal, grants are to be spent “to cover the costs of creating the conditions for large-scale information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.
The money will also be used to buy equipment, repair roofs and power systems in a television and radio company founded in 1959, as reported by RIA News.
Hong Kong Democratic Movement Activists disrupt the Chinese representative's speech the day after the election decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress on Sunday has set a procedure whereby only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the election of the Hong Kong leader in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of a majority of the members of the nominating committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to enter the ballot paper and has forced the activists of the democratic movement to promise once again to stop Hong Kong's financial center with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing’s publication of a document describing China’s control over Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city’s business centre and held a sit-in strike.
The briefing is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Bureau of the Feng Wei Council of State, were also to address a series of briefings during the day.
Activists announced that they would meet at the Hong Kong Head of Government building in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to add 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to add 400 hectares of land to the West Bank of the Jordan, which belongs to the Palestinian Authority.
According to BBC, the decision to join South Bethlehem is linked to the desire to repay the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli Ministry of Defence announced the seizure of the territory on Sunday and instructed the military to establish an administration on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saïb Arikat, the world must hold Israel accountable for “the ongoing settlement activity in the West Bank of Jordan and East Jerusalem”.
Putin wants Kiev to start negotiations on “Statehood” in eastern Ukraine.
According to Russian news reports of his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government cease fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the “Statehood” of the separated region.
His press secretary, Dmitri Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to suggest that East Ukrainian territory under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be reviewed in order to enable the Russian-speaking region to defend its rights and interests.
However, Putin’s call for the Kiev government to enter into negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equal to the obvious strategy that it has followed since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossia de facto independence in order to draw closer to Russia than to the West.
In an interview with State First Television Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return Separatist-held territory to the eastern Donetsk and Lugan oblasts, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists recently named the occupied territories Novorossia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace negotiations would take place in the near future when Ukrainian politicians began campaigning for parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government forces attacked peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, the “plenary of illusions” reported by ITAR-TASS.
“We must immediately begin meaningful negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to meet the interests of the people living there”, he said.
Peskov said that Putin’s words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed with leaders in Kiev for months in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The intervention of the Kremlin Press Secretary to correct Putin's “misinterpretation” underlined the decision of the Russian leadership to behave towards the separatist uprising in the east in a way other than the open capture of Crimea, where most of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much harder battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts of eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants were not Russians, and interviews prior to the conflict showed widespread support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact by handing over to the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would link Russia’s main territory to Crimea.
On the Black Sea peninsula, which was joined five months ago, there is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic sea resorts.
The regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea also include mines, factories and lithium factories that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested, during his inaugural speech on 7 June, that Ukrainian legislators, after new elections, weigh the constitutional amendments that allow the segregated regions to have greater control over their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy seems very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels accused of arming and inciting Moscow.
Putin’s latest call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders, as equals, followed new rebel attacks last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a former peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
Russian-backed separatists took control of the city of Novoazovsk in an attack that Ukrainian security officials say is afraid of being the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic shores to Crimea itself.
This has led to extensive civilian and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, between the Novoazovsky and the narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko called on Saturday for a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which had been independent for 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of non-return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukrainian territory.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a draft of more severe sanctions against Russia to be taken in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowaysk after two columns of Russian armoured equipment and 1,000 military personnel had entered the Donetsk region last week to support difficult separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, the press secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine informed reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly held in Ilowaysk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, reporting Lysenko on Sunday.
The scandal with the naked photo captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco.
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust with hackers who may have stolen naked photos of his fiancée Gabi Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is indignant after a series of candid pictures of naked Jennifer Lawrence were made available on the Internet as a result of a massive hacker scandal with celebrities.
The hacker responsible for this is said to have about 60 candid photographs of the star Lawrence and superstars, including the models of Kate Upton and Kara Delevin, the singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michele, and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors, Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strakovsky, and resident in Melbourne Greco, were also allegedly stolen as a result of iCloud leak.
There's 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, said Confidential, "That's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It's terrible that personal information could be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is in New York City, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was "famous" and that the people it targeted were "invaded."
The hacker's supposed to have 30 pictures of Palmer and his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of her lying by a pool with a nude breast.
Palmer's work in the movies includes Love and Honor with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the movie "Chuck" Stratovsky and the actress from "Prohibited Reception" Browning didn't comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence said to TMZ, "This is an outrageous invasion of privacy."
Acter Seth Rogen expressed his resentment against the hacker by tweeting: "Puting photos stolen from a mobile phone is really no different from selling stolen goods."
Just legally, you can't stand to publish stolen photos.
A potential way of stealing pictures of naked celebrities has been discovered.
The massive hacking of star accounts may have been made through vulnerability in the Find My Phone application.
A potential scenario described The Next Web resource.
A Python script was published on the Github resource, which allowed you to pick passwords for the Window My Phone service of Apple.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
The same link of login and Apple ID password is used to access the Apple iCloud cloud from which photographies of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed you to over-recognize the password from Find My Phone.
This method consistently introduces various combinations of characters, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The script author claimed that there was an unlimited number of passwords entered in the Find My Phone service.
If the security system is properly organized, after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account must be blocked and reported to the user of the attempted hack.
Because of vulnerability, users have not received any reports of trying to find a password for their account.
The hackers recognized the Apple ID password and used it to access the iCloud.
According to Hackapp's Twitter user, vulnerability was detected two days ago, on Saturday, and a script program was written to select passwords.
Vulnerability is now closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the Hackapp user and noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability is common in many services, but noted that there is no evidence that this vulnerability was used to access the star account.
It's not me, plz RT.
On the Prime Minister's Twitter, there's another foreign record.
Although there is no solid evidence that vulnerability was used to steal photos in Find My Phone, there was a wave of harmful actions using this service.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that the safety of the cloud was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Twitter of Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev was also hacked earlier.
If the intruders had access to the iCloud described above, there could be a password for the head of government account in the microblogging service.
The Next Web resource failed to obtain Apple's comments on vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to a Ukrainian five-gauge
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to a well-known Ukrainian athlete, Anne Buryak.
The decree is published on the Internet portal of legal information.
Earlier this year, the athlete moved to Russia for permanent residence and applied to the Federation of Modern Five Fights for the opportunity to speak for the Russian Federation.
In 2013, she won two phases of the World Cup, won a silver medal for the European championship in her personal title, and became a world champion in a mixed relay, which is one of the new types of sport.
It holds its leading positions in the current season.
According to the rules, she would need special permission from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine to speak at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian chess passport to Catherine Lagno, a native of Lviv, who is a two-time European champion (2005, 2008), peace in Blitz (2010) and fast chess (2014).
As part of the Ukrainian women's team, the athlete won the chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the Astana 2013 World Cup and the Warsaw 2013 European Championships.
SCR stopped investigating Tu-204 in Vnukova
The Russian Investigation Committee (RCC) dismissed the criminal case for the accident of the Thu-204 airline Red Wings.
This is reported by the press service of the agency.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the commander of the aircraft and the aircraft engineer.
The forensic examination showed that the accident was caused by the increased speed of landing, the failure of the crew to comply with standard boarding procedures, and the inadvertent introduction of engines into higher direct traction speeds.
The Tu-204 airline Red Wings, travelling on Prague-Moscow, crashed on December 29, 2012, landing at Vnukovo Moscow Airport.
The aircraft rolled over the airstrip and set fire.
The aircraft commander, the second pilot and the flight engineer were killed at the scene.
Two flight attendants were taken to treatment facilities, where they subsequently died of injuries.
Three additional flight attendants who were hospitalized with severe injuries were treated for long periods of time.
In addition, the driver of the vehicle was seriously injured when he was on the Kiev Highway.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
In the aftermath of the disaster, the Transport Attorney's Office conducted an investigation at Red Wings, during which numerous irregularities were detected.
In February 2013, the airline licence was suspended.
The company resumed work in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Emelianenko started training at SIZO.
A well-known Russian mixed-style fighter, Alexander Emelianenko, aged 33, who is in SIZO on charges of sexual assault against a domestic worker, has recovered completely from his injuries and started training.
The Chempionate reports it.
In May this year, the Russian Investigation Committee charged Alexander Emelianenko with rape.
The suspect was wanted and arrested in Tambowa on 9 May following an accident that resulted in a broken thigh.
Emelianenko Jr. was arrested until 31 August, and a sentence was handed down on 1 September.
However, the court was postponed and the investigation insisted on extending the period of detention until 30 September.
If proved guilty, the athlete would be sentenced to up to six years ' imprisonment.
What's the power, brother?
"Lenta.ru" remembers the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emelianenko's career.
Emelianenko held his last match in January of this year, losing his technical knockout to his compatriot Dmitri Sosnovsky.
Alexander is the younger brother of the more famous fighter Fedor Emelianenko.
The latter is a four-time world champion in mixed martial arts, four-time world champion, and seven-time Russian champion in battle samba.
Anger turned out to be the most universal and functional emotion of the human being.
An angry expression is biologically universal for mankind, and every organ and group of muscles involved in its creation is not random, but an additional means of expressing power and threat, researchers in Australia and the United States have discovered.
Their discoveries were reported in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and can be summarized in a press release from the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face - the swollen and lowered eyebrows, stretched into a thin line of lips, the swollen nostrils - is the same in all cultures, and makes it even blind children who have never seen it, notes the lead author, Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists discovered that this emotion arose to effectively manage disputes during the conflict.
The more physical damage one person can do to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his condition, and he communicates it to the person concerned by means of anger.
Researchers have also found another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to be angry and to be manipulative, to be free to impose conditions that are not beneficial to them, and to prefer forceful methods of conflict resolution to be peaceful.
Rejecting from the fact that anger is primarily an “emotion of bargaining,” scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create an angry face should represent an angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thus force him to accept its terms as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, researchers modelled on the computer individuals who had or did not have each of the seven elements of the angry person and showed them to informers.
Although the lower eyebrows or the forward chin alone did not make the face angry, the stronger physical personality was accepted by the researchers.
Like animals, man’s anger expresses a threat: an exaggerated display of his own power, forcing him to accept and submit.
A person blows up his nostrils and his lips for the same purpose as a frog that blows up, or a baboon that shows his fangs.
“Anger” is “started” by the respondent's refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes a form that best demonstrates the consequences of this refusal to the contrary.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of an angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same thing,” noted anthropologist John Tuby.
The minicom offered 250 million rubles to Crimea's radio company.
In 2014, 250 million rubles were proposed from the federal budget for the autonomous non-profit organization Crimea Teleradio Company.
This is stated in a draft Government decree prepared by the department that was consulted by Lenta.ru.
According to the explanatory note to the project, the federal budget grants will be allocated “to cover the costs of creating the conditions for large-scale information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, it is intended to convert the hardware and studio unit, the video walls, the central hardware room and the video server.
A mobile television station and a satellite transmitter are also planned.
In addition, from the funds allocated, the company will pay for the use of the fibre-optic line (VOLS) and the repair of the energy system.
Subsidies will be provided within the federal budget provided for the Minicom.
The State Broadcasting Company Crimea was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, television coverage of the television broadcasting company is more than 75 per cent of the peninsula.
In 2011, Crimea's Teleradio Company was licensed to broadcast digital television.
