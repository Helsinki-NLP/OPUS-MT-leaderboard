Let me check it out.
I've been going for four hours.
Tom bought Mary a ring.
Everyone's looking for happiness.

Is that what you want?
Don't talk so fast, please.

Are you alone now?
Just let Tom finish his routine.
Why did Tom run away?
Has he been staying here before?
Tom's afraid of Mary's dog.
You want a brace?
There's only one week left for Halloween.

Let's sing something together.
I'm happy to help.
Euric!
Did you ask others?
Tom met Mary at work.
What's my password again?
It's a nice coat.
You're so rough.
Let Tom in.

This is a huge mistake.
Why don't you come back to me?
He's the only one who can't do it.
We can't let that happen again.
Tom doesn't feel safe.
Tom says Mary won't worry anymore.
You're not fair.

Stop it!
Maybe it's the same person.
Select words you cannot speak.

It's not him.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary came to Australia.
I bought a lot of books.
Sit here, please.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Ask Tom if he can do it.
Sitting by night will harm your health.
Did you know Tom left town?
They love us.
I don't need a computer.
Really?
Let's go now, or we'll be late.
That's your main problem.
No matter what, he's still making a fool of himself.
He fell under the table.
Tom doesn't want you to do this.
Have I changed so much?
Have you ever lived abroad?
When did you get home?
It'll be hot tomorrow.
We need to talk.
The election was November.
No one knows what's going to happen.

Where is the subway station?
No one knows how I feel.
I don't think Tom's gonna be here tonight.
We want to stay for three more nights.
He's still too young for this job.
I got to the point.
I really don't know how else I can explain this.
I'm not sure Tom knows what to do.
You're taller than me.
That's great!
Tom bought Mary a Christmas present.
I realized I wasn't ready.
If you want to be a string, stick to that diet.
Start counting.

I've never heard Tom speak French.
I thought you said Tom was your brother.
Is he honest?
Tom doesn't tell me the truth.
Do you know this song?
I want to know exactly how Tom died.
Life is sometimes so unfair.
I don't plan on doing this anymore.
Tom has full money in his suitcase.
You fool!
I loved Lila's sister.
I bought this book for ten dollars.
Tom's a lot older than he looks.

Can I ask you a few questions?
They all came back to see Tom.
Where's Dad?
Then he took off his glasses.
Short hair suits her very well.
Tom's got it.
Take the chicken before you prepare it.
I felt relieved when I said everything I wanted to say.
I bought Tom a sweater.
It's done like this.
I love cats.
Are you looking for something specific?
Whose fault is that?
No one's stopping you.
Tom wants to join the team.
You're too thin.
Come here.
There's a map on the wall.
You're very pretty.
I came to see you.
What's your favorite pizza stuff?
The last point of view has many supporters in Japan.
You don't think you could do that?
I don't know what I can do for you.
Tom's smart.
He's annoying.
If you go, I'll miss you.
Point the smart guy to a mistake, and he'll thank you, point the bad guy to a mistake, and he'll hurt you.
That's a great idea.
I don't think there's anything in there.
Make your point clearly.
You don't know us.
Tom probably forgot to tell Mary about it.
Do you happen to know where Tom lives?
I'll ask Tom for dinner.
Maybe I'll do it again.
You really think I'd do that?
It's a lie.
War took happiness from them.
I'd like to have enough money to buy a car.
Mary took off her laptop.
Don't play with the key.
Wouldn't Tom like to do that?
This bridge is by no means safe.
Can it wait?
I don't have a heavy suitcase like Tom's.
You're betraying me.
I like drinking.
She sells an old-fashioned hat.
I like cats more than dogs.
Mary says she can't help us today.
You can go if you're determined.
He confessed his guilt.
Tom's convinced Mary's guilty.
The show's on Friday.
I'd eat the oar.
I'm wondering if Tom can do it.
We are confident that we will deal with this.
His home country is Germany.
It's an orange.
He's an atheist.
What does your aunt do?
I was playing with the champion.
Tom warned you this could happen.
To be honest, I don't agree with you.
Mary said she believed it.
When are you leaving?
I have a lot of friends.
I wish I could stay here forever.
After lunch, she always has time.
The land covers a smaller part of the earth’s surface.
I have a twin.
We begged Tom not to go there.
I think we may have been too aggressive.
You're big.
I have some free time.
I'll help you tomorrow.
This story has entertained me.
Watch your head!
I'll miss you.
Take this.
Tom asked you to do something?
Tom's dog's name is Cookie.
I just changed the password.
I didn't do anything like that.
It took me about three hours to read the book.
The tooth fairy is a tooth thief.
I thought you'd like it.

I just want to talk to them.
We didn't do anything wrong.
I get in trouble a lot.
Tom's still doing what he's supposed to do.
He married my brother.
She's teaching us French.
He wasn't at the meeting.
It's Tuesday.
Someone must have told Tom, but it wasn't me.
Don't worry, we're on our way.
The fire was quickly extinguished.
He took a picture of the family.
We've been to Troms a lot.
English Bush is perfect.
Do you know what kind of blood group Tom has?
I've never been to Europe.
Tom's trying to avoid arguing with Mary.
They'll understand.
There's only one store all over the island.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do this.
Tom's deeply confused.
Is anyone here?
Don't call me.
It's better to die standing up than to live on your knees.
Tom's waiting.
Everybody likes Tom.
I knew you'd wait for us.
I can't forget her.
They chose a new government.
Please wait five minutes.
I don't want to talk to Tom.
Bring me a clean plate and take the dirty.
Tom told me he was on his own.
Here's the church we got married to.
I don't think Tom's gonna be here.
I think that makes sense.
I hope you won't be too disappointed.
He was popular among the voters.
Tom didn't give up the French bill.
Elizabeth, Queen of England.
Where am I going to go?
Tom followed Mary’s example.

Dance.
I have a great teacher.
He needs to be killed.
What will we eat tonight?
Have you found them yet?
You have to give her more time.
What are you doing with this?
She's hard on him.
You're such a jerk!
Dad bought me a book.
Tom's energy-intensive.
So a lot of things didn't like them.
Tom knew Mary wouldn't be busy.
Dry sand collects water.
You always loved Tom, didn't you?
Here you go!
Tom says he can't win.
I'm not doing this.
Tom didn't look offended.

They're sorry.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
Who told you I did it?
It's never too late.
Leave me alone, I'm asleep.

Tell us something.
I'm glad you're doing this.
Since I did not receive an answer, I wrote to her again.
What would you like to say about this?
You think it's a trap?
People, stop killing each other.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were planning on doing this.
I borrowed Tom's car.

Why are you mad at me?
Let's go get drunk.

You need to stop doing this now.
My grandfather talks very slowly.
Did you win?
She can speak English quite well.

Is there anything cold to drink?

Tom's waiting for me at the station.
I'm putting the tips in my coffee.

Mother Fawldi married for the second time.
He's got ten cows.
I like English.
You're cruel.
Looks like the autumn's here.
I saw a man walk into the room.
He's anything but stupid.
I was afraid it might happen.
Who else was at the meeting?
He talks too fast.
Tom offered Mary a pretty good job.
Will Tom help you?
She's got a nice face.
Tom didn't want it.

I still don't like Tom very much.
So we'd better stay home.
Tom seems to be smoothing.
Did you know Tom?
Tom said he had a lot of friends in Boston.
The food's getting better.
Tom and Mary are fine.
I can see myself in the mirror.
It would be good to see Tom again.
Ten minutes on the bus to the station.
Why does Tom not plan to do so?

I learned that Tom had an accident.
I hope you come back.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?
You told me to do it.
Tom and Mary are rivals.
Tom wants me to apologize.
Try not to cry.
You have a very sharp hearing.
Can I do that again?
Are your kids still asleep?
You have to try again.
Is Tom Christian?
I want to see what happens.
Tom sat in front of Mary.
I have less money than you do.
Tom lives in Boston, right?
He's an office worker.
You think Tom's gonna win, right?
Could you stop, please?
They were following you.
I'm waiting for your answer.
Tom didn't have any scuffles.
Tom's room is locked.
Of course you do.

Could you show me the way to the port?
What did you do last night?
Tom is a good doctor.
Don't you want this job?
Tom said he needed to buy something to eat.

Where can I get my luggage?
Tom said he hoped Mary could win.
Wake up the children.
We've had a lot of drinks.
Who else did you tell?
Tom lost his voice.
Is that your beer?
Security is not guaranteed.
I didn't see them.
Tom's dancing.
Give me your wallet.
You don't have anything.
Even a teacher may be wrong.
We were disappointed in him.
Tom may be dead by now.
I'm gay.
Why am I so tired?
Wait till the end of my exams.
How many children do you have?
I'm not done with Tom yet.
There are thousands of shepherds in Ukraine.
You're very persistent, aren't you?

I think it's a good apprehensive.
I wonder if she'll recognize me after all these years.
I'm sometimes very careless.
I know you don't trust us.
I didn't kill anyone.
I don't think Tom's gonna be in Australia next week.
Tom had to wait.
You ate.
I haven't seen him in about three years.
I'm afraid I won't finish the report in time.
It's unlikely I'll be there tonight.
I don't trust you.
It travels the world.
The boys are fine.
I wonder if Tom told Mary she had to do it.
Tom said why would he need the money?
You're good.

I don't live in Boston anymore, I moved to Chicago.
It only happened once.

You gave me good advice.
This bike doesn't belong to Tom.
I thought you lost my watch.
I don't remember you at all.
These houses are my uncle.
I just did my job.
No one called Tom.
No one knows what's going to happen.
We're always waiting for something.
Thank you for your attention.
I didn't apologize.
Many young people this summer went to Hawaii.
Tom is my twin brother.
At this point, there are no comments.
Tom, I want to stay with you.
Do not resist.
You're gonna pay for this!
Do you understand me?
Tom cut himself.
Tom thinks Mary can do this?
Is that your hat?

He speaks German.
Tom's not as busy as you.
Why do you need so many shoes?
You're very brave.
I'm totally naked.
No one has heard anything about my country.
He became a national hero.
Tom said where he did it?
We're studying Chinese.
How do I get on the other side?
Do we have a choice?
There's no way.
Let me see.
Tom began to realize what was going on.
Promise me you'll come.
Take off your coat.
He runs to the station every morning.
They're running out of food.
Not here.
No one was satisfied.
I hope so.
I'm such an idiot.
I tried to sleep.
Tom's always online.
I moved here from Boston.
Tom just sent me a text message.
So somewhere in this building.
We're open tomorrow.
I didn't expect such a turn of events.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
I asked him what his name was.
When do you want to go?
There's got to be some logic.
Did you work last night?
How did you convince Tom to help us paint the cliffs?
Were you in the capital, Washington, U.S.A.
Mary kept her balance.
I'm just lucky.
They're very subjective.
It's a handwriting.
I wonder if Tom is angry or not.
I have to get ready for the test.
The plane flew east.
Don't let him touch it.
Tom says he's your friend.
The Russians watch TV!

He invited her to the concert.
What does a suspect look like?
No one could stop it.
Tom died of hunger.
It's good you're here.
I let the cat in.
I left your umbrella on the bus.
It's in the children's room.
Does this animal eat humans?
You're a vegetarian?
Do you want to live forever?
Listen to what I have to say.
He'll be here soon.
Can't you lift me up?
I'm not pregnant.
He didn't crash.
I have a question.
There's more to it than that!
Tom said Mary was probably still doing it.
I'm not sure I agree with him.
The boss let me go early today.
What time is the end of the world?
I'm never worried.
How sweet!
When I'm in bad humour, I start singing.
I don't owe him anything.
Where's your key?
It's gonna be pretty cold tonight.
I'm not asking Tom for help.
How much you paid to do that.
You don't have to stay.
One day we'll meet again.
You said you wouldn't do that.
It was a long flight.
Don't tell anyone.
I've got to go.
I was disintegrated.
Tom outdone me.
How many people died?

Are these rumors true?
That's what we really want, isn't it?
Finally, he decided to make her an offer.
Tom Anitrix was not surprised that Mary spoke French so well.
I know you're here.
It's half past three.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
There is no great hope.
It's not mine.
What exactly do you want, Tom?
We're almost done.
So we have to be home by 2:30.
You go to school on foot?
Is that Tom's girl?
Tom's wasting his time.
The molecule is made up of atoms.
We realize that.
Now's not a good time.
Do you have time for lunch with me?
I'm sorry he didn't come to the meeting.
Where do you live now?
You know, he's been through a tough time lately.
Tom married a neighbor.
My head hurts.
Repeat again, please.
I'll be with you in a second.
I'm learning English.
It's good weather, isn't it?
Come if you can.
I hate it!
You're a little young for me.
Tom's too old for you.
Tom said he hoped Mary would do it.
Tom didn't look around.
My parents just arrived at the station.

Your shoes are right here.
We're on our way home.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
I'll be back in less than five minutes.
You don't aim well enough.
I'd like to order a sandwich.

Where's Dad?
Who else helped you?
I'd love to help you.
Are you over 18?
The dog is trying to escape.
Tom can't read.
I just bought a boat.
Tom had no idea Mary was into him.
Tom's disgusting.
The pharmacy is on Fresno Street.
Tom's your uncle, isn't he?
Are you ready to hear the bad news?
I talked to them.
Has Lucy called yet?
Looks like Tom.
You don't have to do that if you don't want to.
I was just about to wash up.
Smooth!
Did Tom mention any problems?
Where does Tom have to do that?
Mary wants me on her team.
No one else listens.
You're brave.
You have to do it yourself.
That means Tom was right.
I'll sit over there.
Put it down.
Tom came last.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.
Mary ate alone.
You're really gonna find them, aren't you?
I'm not good with moisture.

Tom said he didn't have to hurry.
It's a French word.
I've seen this movie for a long time.
He's not here right now.
Tom's right-handed.
She wins cancer.
I want a lot more than that.
You don't have to let Tom do this.
Tom gives us good advice.
This car is easy for me to drive.
I changed the marking of my website.
I have eight brothers and sisters.
Have you been busy?
Show it to me.
Why didn't you tell Tom?
Tom won't try to do that.
Fighting Tom wasn't such a good idea.
Tom proved he had Liverpool in his heart.
I licked a spoon.
I kissed Tom yesterday.
Why did Tom kill Mary?
Tom said it didn't happen.
Let's stop this useless discussion.
Tom cleaned the apple.
Tom didn't read the report you wrote.
Did you talk to Tom about this?
No one would have helped me do that.
You're Italian.
What is she like?
A pocket thief pulled Mark's passport out.
I think you like him.
This magazine costs only two pounds, including delivery.
I'll miss you.
I sat down at the shop next to Tom.
They love each other.
Come back tomorrow.
What kind of insects did you eat?
I saw Tom get hit by a car.
Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do this.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what a stapler looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees it.
I got on the wrong bus.
I gave up on that offer.
Mary has already done what she had to do.
I was watching Tom.
Did you reserve a table?
Where did the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
How about we go to the picnic?
We couldn't buy our concert tickets until we got the money from our friends.
Tom was calling Mary this morning.
Maybe some other time.
Tom refused to let Mary into the house.
Tom doesn't play tennis very well.
I'm a Palestinian.
I can't do it alone.
You're needed by Tom here.
We're out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People who live in a place cannot learn the satisfaction of living in a village.
Mary has good eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, a cola and fries.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom gladly agreed.
I think Tom's wrong.
Are you okay?
Maybe you're the only one who can do this.
Who doesn't have a radio?
Your singing makes professional singers blush from shame.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!
Tom's a pushover.
It was big.
Tom knows it wasn't Mary.
Esther is a Jewish lesbian.
Last week, a dog ate me.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.
Try to swim!
You were lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's time for dinner.
It's unlikely that Tom will forget how it's done.
Drinking?
Will Tom do it with you?
You're not sleeping?
The meeting began at 5:00 p.m.
Mary said she liked doing it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I've only been to Tokyo once.
I got the electricity bill.
What color is his steward?
Last week, I bought a new car.
I'm sure Tom will be fine.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom planned to do that.
The presence of all members is mandatory.
Don't you feel comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning on doing this with?
We are satisfied with our decisions.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kissing Mary.
He was standing in the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is that Mary's husband?
He'll find out.
A Witness who saw the whole thing with his own eyes is worth more than ten witnesses who heard it.
Guess who I am.
Tom went back to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis for an hour a day.
It's done with Tom.
When I entered the room, she played the piano.
You're very sweet.
Where are your manners?
They have not lost hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When do you expect to come?
Tom pulled out his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We need to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Tom told you where the party is?
Mary's tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
It filled the vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll eat it.
I don't want any more.
Do you know what colors she likes?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here tonight.
Tom opened a restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I'm jealous of your good health.
Yes, with pleasure!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
It's a lie.
There is no pyramid in Europe.
It's spring soon.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me that?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom's very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to come up with a secret language.
Are you planning on staying for a while?
When do you plan to go to Japan?
My kids are in school.
I put my suitcase on.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking about you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant eagle.
Saturate the salt on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We managed to cross the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom's younger than you.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom's very open.
I'm hungry because I didn't eat.
I'm not blaming anyone.
The plane flew out at 9:00.
Tom speaks French quite freely.
John caught a tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll check it out myself.
Tom was wiped out with a towel.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I've got a lot of time.
Let yourself be happy.
She wants to wait for the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need the facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
Next month, Tom leaves Boston.
Careful, it's still hot.
Let's kiss.
Millions of people die of hunger each year.
I was wondering what Tom wanted.
There was a wrong address on the letter.
This is the last train.
Who's gonna fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
It's all chocolate.
They moved on to another religion.
I need to be more careful.
I downloaded them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What's he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever gonna do that?
We were able to save them.
He's a strange person.
I just got my hair cut.
Mary said she never studied French.
I think I'll buy a new car.
It's our fault.
You're so sweet.
It's going to cost about $15.
I blew the door.
His theory deserves attention.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
It's not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She's a tenist.
That's how Tom became famous.
You had a good time, didn't you?
You sang.
I did it perfectly.
I like to write.
Kioto is a uniquely beautiful city.
Next month, I'm sixteen.
You think there's a chance this is gonna happen?
Accept your dreams.
What time will your last lesson end?
I came to say goodbye, Tom.
I like this dog.
I tried to contact her.
What does she have?
How's the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing this.
We have to help Tom.
It's been raining all day.
I was upset about that.
Can I have your phone number?
You need to stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could do this?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is ten minutes behind.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun shines on the day and the moon on the night.
I got a kick at her.
You were right before.
I hope Tom can help us.
You have the right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I have a problem with my boss.
It's a banana.
Tom is likely to be punished for what he did.
Mary's your girlfriend?
London has dampened the fog.
I'm really glad you're here, Tom.
Tom's weak.
I told him to come to Australia.
Do you usually travel abroad?
You have to be flexible.
I believe you'll win.
She went to the airport to escort him.
Get out of the way.
He's in the kitchen.
Please don't be mad.
They won't tell us.
Work slowly.
The capital of Brazil is Brazil.
What I really want is to sleep.
I still have to pay the phone bill.
Tom can cook.
The music makes him nervous.
What languages are spoken in America?
You deserve to rest.
These are fresh.
Tom's eyes are huge.
The rainbow has seven colors.
I think that's why we shouldn't be doing this.
He's gloomy today.
I wish we could spend more time together.
Listen to his open mind.
Aren't you in line tonight?
Tom never had to learn much.
How's your wife, Tom?
I accept your offer.
Bill has many friends.
That would be unfair.
It's either you or Jane.
If I were you, I'd ignore it.
Tom's just gonna be here right now.
These are the most expensive shoes I've ever seen.
It's a Greek name.
You think I'm kidding?
Today I was very tired.
I'm true.
Happiness is not to possess many things.
The news spread throughout Japan.
Tom showed up on the side of the mountain.
Taxi's here.
I heard him come down the stairs.
It's mine.
How strange!
Do you know how to read Cyrillic?
I know Tom pretty well.
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom's clean, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such an asshole.
Tom gave you something for me?
I would never have been able to do that without your help.
I always have coffee and pots for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I haven't eaten.
I'm the best.
How was your exam?
Can I pay you later?
Did that just happen?
Mary didn't take the umbrella with her.
Did you hear me?
To be honest, I've been lying.
I'm going to bed!
He doesn't like eggs.
I found the money.
I don't understand why he did it.
They're all tourists.
Can you lend me a pincet?
It's your life.
Tom said he wanted to drink.
I wonder if Tom once asked Mary why she didn't.
Patrick doesn't know how to write.
I was too embarrassed.
I'm getting deeper into the details.
Tom said he didn't want to do it.
Let's go to the ocean.
Do you know what causes the problem?
Where's Boston?
I need your opinion.
Don't worry, she doesn't understand German.
Is she hiding something?
Tom said he was interested.
I have a good appetite today.
We're quiet in our new house.
There are only two infinite things in the world, the universe and human stupidity, and I can't be sure about the first.
She said, "I'm very happy."
It's interesting to talk to Tom.
You reap what you sow.
What are you looking at?
Can't we go faster?
We're not just footballers.

There's a secret passage.
I don't want to argue with you.
Let me in.
She's unconscious.
I thought Tom wouldn't do it.
I love you.
Which floor do you live on?
Tom was a little confused.
He signed the check.
Hey, how you doing?
The password is Muiriel.
Did you hear what Tom said?
Tom's reading novels.
Take the trash out.
You're my buddy.
He's got two cars.
They realized.
No problem!
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
Can I borrow your knives?
Thank her for her help.
Tom confirmed that no one was injured.
She slept with 25 men in one night and then killed them.
They went to the zoo.
I was shy.
They're not rich.
Take my hand, we'll build a utopia together.

One of them is lying.

Please take this.
No one likes to lose.

What are you gonna do tomorrow?
This is my wife, Edith.
This student is an American.
The cloud of gray.
No one's seen us.
I'll wait here.
As a young woman, she lived in the outskirts of Tokyo.
Does any of this matter?

Tom loves Mary very much.
Tom's cooking dinner.
The dog is smart.
I can't get the photos out of the camera!
I was amazed to know what I had won.
I wonder if Tom told Mary she had to do it.
All dogs are animals, but that doesn't mean all animals are dogs.
Those who can come up with only one way to write a word obviously lack imagination.
I'm sure of his success.
Tom didn't do it.
Where's the nearest subway station?
Tom escaped through the window.
You're not hiding anything?
How's it going?
I didn't know it was going to happen.
I have a lot of friends.
You can just do it now.
There's no speed limit.
Tom's a little red.
That's what you're supposed to do.

I think they're students.
I just want to say that you did your job well.
I think you've said enough.
I'm a client.
I'm very greedy.
You're crazy.
Tom won't worry Mary anymore.
Answer me now.
I thought Tom was missing the house.
Tom hasn't done this since last year.
You're done complaining?
Aren't you Mary's husband?
Do they speak English?
No one's seen Tom.
The police continued their investigation.
I think I know what Tom would do.
Tom said he was very busy.
What will you do today?
I love this game.
How's Emily?

Tomorrow's a great day.
Is the job done yet?
Get some water.
It's a variety of colors.
Tom smiled at the waitress.
You're not needed.
Tom can't buy that car.
Even a child could handle it.
Do you have a copy of that report?
Tom will never wake up.
That's enough for now.
I was able to swim.
Did you buy Tom a dog?
Looks like everyone's busy.
I can't accept that.
You're very nice.
Take this.
Tom's gone.
Tom will be released on Monday.

It's gonna be okay.
I'll see Mary this afternoon.

You're sick, you need to rest.
The bear has a short tail.
That surprised him.
I hate him too.

They don't look happy.
He's a real man.
I don't trust you.
I'm Ukrainian.
Can I go home?
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do that.
Time to go.
Tom ran as fast as he could.
I can't open the door.
When did it start?
I like fries.
He's almost always in the hospital.
I just moved in.
Who are you, and what are you doing here?
Thank you for yesterday.
Tom says he's got a tenor.
Don't listen to him, he's making some nonsense.
Only the roiguls scoop on the ground.
Tom, could you get up?
I don't even have a job.
Why would you use that?
Tom lost his husband a few months ago.
I'm a little tired.
You have to help me get Tom.

Take off your hat.
There's no point in regretting it now.

I'm angry with Tom.
I'll sue you.
Put it here.
Tom told Mary, and Mary told John.
He showed me his album.
Wouldn't you rather do it with Tom?
Who was running?
I hate my neighbors.
Who can explain this to me?
I'm in love with Tom's friend.
Am I early?
It looks serious.
Red isn't your color.
I'm not sure if Tom does it or not.
Tom went first.
Are you mad at Tom?
Mary lacks good judgment.
I don't go to school on Sunday.
Tom's dog bit Mary by the hand.
Have you bought Christmas presents yet?
I gave him my address.
I woke up early enough to catch the first train.
Don't jump!
Those who want peace prepare for war.

Of course, he knows the answer.
It's just a dream.
Is it still here?
He's legal to her.
I just want to rest.
I hope you have an alibi.
I hate journalists.
Tom's out of town again.
How's it going?

I want to rest.
I have Tom's keys.
She has white teeth.

I think Tom will win.
We can win this war.
Thank you, it's okay.

What did you do with my hand?
Mary knows the police are looking for her.
I told Tom the joke.
Can we come too?
You're doctors.
How do you like this town?
I like your coffee.
Tom woke up.
How much in one night?
I'm twice your age.
Mary's like my own daughter.
It wasn't Tom, it was Mary.
That's justified.
You're too nervous.
Have you ever seen this logo before?
About the same time, Tom was in his room and was studying.
Tom said he didn't think Mary really liked doing it on her own.
I know it's easy for you.
Put this sticker on your suitcase.
I thought you said you were the only kid in the family.
I have some French books.
When Peter got up, John had already left the house.

Tom will be very sad.

There are exceptions to every rule.
Tom knew something bad was about to happen.
Everyone doesn't care what you think.
They voted.
I refuse to talk to you!
It's red.
I enjoyed hanging out with him at the party.
Nothing I did helped.
You're absolutely right.
The kid and the girl are sitting on the fence.
I screamed.
This box is a little tricky.
They're from Sweden.
They sent me to save you.
Tom understands.
Tom's used to it.
Tom's been working all night.
She's not always happy.
I'm sure Tom will do whatever Mary asks him to do.
They're good.
Do you have a subway map?
I'm no different from any other mother's witches.
I underestimated the strength of the adversary.
Which floor are we on?
Tom's getting nervous.
Tom can wait here.
My brother lives in Boston.
I've always liked him.
What a strange life!
You can do whatever you want.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Sadly, she already has a regular lover.
I bought each one of them for a gift.
Someone's calling.
When does this end?
Tom was a spy.
I didn't know you had a car.
She's listening to him.
Soup's too hot.
He fell on the ground.
You're always late.
Can he come tomorrow?
This is my final offer.

We've been singing this song before.
Why didn't you go to the office?
I don't think Tom knows anyone at our school.
She bought her nose for ten dollars.
First, let's talk about what Tom did.

I was just.
When did I lie?
I think Tom's a friend.
We didn't have much time.
I like to carry cards.
He's a slut.
What's a computer?
I'm not illiterate.
Did you sing it yourself?
What do you recommend?
Tom decided to do it.
Your medicine's ready.
I thought you were interested.
Well, everyone's his own, huh?
I was so excited that I couldn't sleep.
Tom's alive.
I was nervous.
Tom recently changed his job.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.
Tom was upset.
She was an alien, and she was treated as a foreigner.
Karen went there herself.
Am I nervous?
The girl we saw waiting for someone outside Tom’s house was Mary.
Why don't you quit smoking?
We all make mistakes.
He wondered why his wife left him.
I think I put too much sugar.
Do you know how to ride carpets?
I know how it's done.
Tom ate?
I don't have to cook dinner tonight.
I have something to say.
The hotel can receive 300 people.
That's why I baked the pie.
He can ask questions and answer them.
Tom said he had an alibi.
Tom has two girlfriends.
What's Tom doing in Boston?
Tom didn't think Mary would want to do it.
Tom and Mary said they weren't sick.
I have a lot of time.
One more thing, please.
I'm a member of the team.
I had a stroke last year.
Mom's busy cooking dinner.
Horses are useful animals.
Hurry up and come back.
He's incompetent.
Thomas was practicing.
He's unbearable.
He's sure he's going to make an exam.
Tom voted for the offer.
Tom told you how long it took him to do this?
Let's get started!
Attention!
I'm exhausted.
The prospects are not too bright.
I do not believe in anything supernatural, but I am fascinated by the Devil’s literature.
The problem is that she lacks experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary called their child John.
I wonder if Tom is actually going to Mary's concert.
Tom said he spent the past weekend with this?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us how to sing.
Let's not do anything in general.
Tom wants his father buried next to his mother.
You don't think we'd notice?
Your dinner was so tasty!
I just found a solution to the problem.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm a DJ.
I hate Christmas.
Was the money enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It's too expensive.
A child was lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to restrain yourself.
We're fine.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows many.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We're gonna lose.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Talk to me.
The surface of the balloon is a non - Euclidean space, so it is not subject to euclide geometry.
The talks were successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I tried to call you.
I've never killed anyone.
Be honest and honest.
There is always hope.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're twice my age.
The journalist was kidnapped by terrorists.
I missed the ball.
I hate this town.
Now he lives in Tokyo.
Programming languages are his hobby.
I'm glad to hear that.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How many watches do you have in your house?
Tom's deaf.
That's why you don't like eating fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
Tom is very proud of you.
Your doctor says you'll be fine.
You're a panda.
You want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need that money.
My stew is orange.
Is Tom still crying?
So I'd like to be higher.
I have to help my mom.
His book inspired me.
Are you brothers?
These aren't my ideas.
You have a plan, don't you?
He's walking.
Tom's not in town.
My shoes were bad.
Next year's gonna be worse.
Mary's in the yellow dress.
Love has a bitter smile.
The meeting was over.
You should have done it last year.
I thought I couldn't do that.
I've got an old car.
We understand why.
I eat every year.
I felt helpless.
I like the teacher.
Let's take the elevator.
Tom is a professional hockey player.
We went into the woods looking for insects.
These chairs are different.
I saw her a week ago.
A small coffee millie costs two euros.
Motherly love is more than anything.
He was persecuting a thief.
I worked at a restaurant.
I'm not determined enough.
Doing this won't be as boring as you think.
He accidentally put salt in his cup of coffee.
Tom forgot to tell you.
I'm interested in music.
I really don't want to eat now.
The fragments of the mirror were scattered on the floor.
You're so weird.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a wonderful car!
She skipped school.
Tom sat by the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
Tom doesn't think I should do that.
State debt is rising.
Why am I me, not you?
Tom will probably never do that.
That doll.
Get out of here!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I read this story in a book.
Does Tom still have a bike?
Speak briefly.
Tom's smarter.
It was a rough night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could do that.
I'm a teacher.
You played well, didn't you?
I was born in Osaka in 1997.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do that.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends too much time on the Internet.
You're adorable.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's go meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't stop it.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's leaving in thirty minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car to.
We can talk.
The computer can count very quickly.
You're not needed.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
What's the weather?
I am thirty years old.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
Would you like some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for lunch today?
You can't even change a diaper.
Do people still use webcams?
I wonder if Tom once asked Mary why she dropped out of school.
This word is borrowed from Greek.
Am I gonna die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
My brother is sick.
Don't push.
The car's outside.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.
Mary lost her money.
There are no rules.
Layla became pregnant very quickly.
He's not a liar.
Do you know how to make a salad out of raw fish?
Tom knew he knew Mary.
Tom's making breakfast.
No doubt it will rain.
Tom did not mention Australia.
Clearly, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
We actually went to Boston.
There are many volcanoes in Iceland.
John is two years older than me.
Better or worse, television has changed the world.
I'm a little fat.
He answered my question easily.
What's the purpose of your trip?
Tom's looking for something.
He must be innocent.
I love kids.
Who's left?
When does she come?
That's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm really glad I did it yesterday.
Tom still lives next to you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a magician.
Don't interrupt me when I talk.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you meet him often?
You'd like Tom.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She's got wine.
You're gonna stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was in the 2000 ’ s.
Tom's probably gonna take care of it.
It has to be the right color.
Tom's mother is very strict.
After a brief peace, war broke out again.
It's best not to trust Tom.
Just talk to Tom.
Can I remind you of your promise?
The capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What's the name of this restaurant?
Excuse me, could you hand me the sugar?
Where exactly does Tom plan to build his house?
"Where's my laptop?" -- "On the chair."
I don't think there'll be any problems.
Tom's broken?
You need a haircut.
Green suits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary's playing football.
How does this work?
You're very ugly.
Hurry up, boys.
I'll fix my shirt.
When is his return expected?
I had a good rest.
He's no less good than his sister.
Tom beats Mary.
I'm making too many mistakes.
He is not afraid of death.
It would be nice if we had 28 hours in the day, wouldn't it?
Kobe is where I was born.
He would have wanted this catastrophe not to happen.
We don't expect to win.
I don't have any money.
I'm not teaching here anymore.
We didn't find the guy.
Take the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a di-jay.
Tom will soon learn to swim.
What's wrong with how I did it?
They know how to fish.
Tom's out of the room.
I'm still doing this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got his first prize.
Tom's teaching French.
I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thought he could do it.
I don't have books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My job is very boring.
He's kind of a robot man.
Answer the question!
You're needed in the hospital.
I can't find the lifts.
It's a fake.
It wasn't Tom who asked Mary to do it.
He's got green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom often makes mistakes.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true Tom has never been to Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, and there was a Grand Pri.
Tom's proud of his daughter.
Don't worry about it.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do it.
English is not my language.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's the girl's name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So we shouldn't do it again.
They've been living here for ten years.
Tom looked at Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of the children while she's gone.
I'm cooking now.
Did you see Tom's passport?
Do you want to dance?
He's often late.
Do you remember that summer when Tom took his head off?
Why would Tom do that?
I know this girl's father.
This is my third marriage.
Tom can't come with us.
I've scored thirty points.
If I don't, Tom's gonna be mad.
Aren't you a psychologist?
Don't you write that down?
The big tree fell on the road, and when I drove, it blocked my way.
I like Tom's company.
Not all the gold that shines.
I don't have many friends.
Do you believe in the existence of a god?
I live in Boston.
Tom is blind from birth.
Didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Aren't you starting to get bored?
What kind of men do you like?
Why do people still smoke?
I'm not working for you.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
I'm a student, and he's not.
That's what I tried to do.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son's new sleds.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister, Sakiko, who was born the same year as me, and now she's preparing for the exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Did you finish your homework?
Monday will probably be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Perhaps you should help Tom paint the fence.
Why do humans act like big monkeys, and vice versa?
Can you help me?
Asshole.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go see a doctor.
I've filed the documents for the visa.
It's snowing today.
She continued to work.
The moth broke when we went to the mountain.
Tom's driving.
If you ate less hamburgers, you'd probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Mary's not coming, is she?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go in person.
Please show me how this is done.
Aren't you dating anyone?
All the shops are busy.
I haven't made a decision yet.
What's the date today?
Where's Daddy?
Lock the door.
I'm not talking to Tom French.
The apple does not fall far from the apple.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
The uncle is the brother of your father or mother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She has red eyes.
They're not coming back.
I was wearing jeans.
I'll see you after the show.
I'd like to ask you a question.
That's my grandmother.
It's a whale.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined the Church of Satan.
I still want to do this to you.
Tom doesn't have any money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
Do you mind?
I haven't seen you in all eternity.
You're obviously right.
Whose books?
That's what you want to do, isn't it?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom walks dogs twice a day.
Let me see Tom's book.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Sikoku, Honshu, and Kyushu.
You must be very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money in the bank.
I think we should go now.
We didn't do it.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I can't help you.
It's broken.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can match him in a tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you realize that?
She committed suicide.
We've got computers on our office.
We have to pay in time.
Are you sure?
You think Tom's gonna die?
Aren't you planning on staying?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it immediately.
Let's sing the song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You missed a lot of things.
I'm wearing shoes.
You can count on me.
His book has become a subject of criticism.
It's gonna be genius.
I'm really scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's much worse.
I'm in trouble.
You didn't waste your time.
Who knows when Tom's gonna do it?
Tom was witnessing in Mary’s case.
I thought you'd gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
May I ask your name?
I wrote you ten letters.
What do we do?
Aren't you gonna vote?
You need to quit smoking.
I think Tom's betraying.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Do you know how to play violin?
Can you give me the salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks French well.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
He was popular both among the students and among the teachers.
Tears can't help tears.
Tom's playing football and running.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll meet Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom couldn't speak French?
He always sings when he showers.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hanged the listener.
I'll be right back.
The church is at the foot of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did you do that?
More coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do it.
Tom's calling you.
You have to tell him to do it.
He speaks esperanto with a small French accent.
It's not your knife.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't get around it.
She's got good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom comes to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a ladies’ helper.
I'll deal with it.
Did you find any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a magician?
Am I nice?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Fuck off.
You're gonna let Tom kill you?
You're a beautiful woman.
There is hope.
When I was a kid, I was very shy.
Tom actually moved to Boston?
Tom pulled Mary a beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow up so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He went back to the hotel.
When did you get back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
The speakers follow the rules of their language, knowingly, without even knowing them.
Tom's on vacation.
What happens if I press this button?
The hunters aimed their rifles at the elephant.
There's no wavering.
They tried.
Tom and Mary are still here?
Thomas’s wife is Canadian.
Do you have any allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do this.
I'd like to take the money.
I shake Tom's hand.
They'll be fine.
Half of these apples are rotten.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You don't have to worry about tomorrow's exam.
Did Tom vote?
I'll be back.
Tom won't force Mary to do this.
Tom started sewing.
Instead of going to school, he stayed at home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You shouldn't trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You can't escape.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where'd you spend your weekends?
This year you got a Christmas present from Tom?
I'm still a little bored with home and so many things seem strange to me.
I have a memory problem sometimes.
Where's Mom?
He regained consciousness three hours after the accident.
Do you speak Macedonian?
You don't have to talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me right now.
Is Tom okay?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know why?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom's a little behind schedule.
Tom's not a hero.
Is it possible to catch a cab here?
Hurry up, you'll be late.
It's gonna be hard.
Does Tom always act like that?
I like to play golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You never lie.
Wait a minute, did you say "girl" or "boyfriend"?
It'll work, you'll see.
She threw him away.
Tom's safe.
I finally got my driver's license.
I'm not a student.
So Mary was sorry.
I'm just watching the news right now.
Tom keeps checking his phone.
How's your wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom's not rich, Mary's rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone's late, except me.
Stop it!
It's a book.
I'm not planning on scattering the boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom's got a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed in your efficiency.
Didn't you have a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you learning?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Hello.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She totally ignores me.
Tom's going to the party tonight.
I did.
She was on her way to the airport.
She studies Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this would happen?
What is it?
If natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, esperanto can be compared to a plastic tree that was created artificially.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's going to Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a nice garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you were just doing your job.
We'll go on foot.
Tom said what happened?
I finally realized I'm not in love with you.
Did you just say that 'cause I was kidding?
That's why it was so boring.
Tom said I was beautiful.
I'll be at the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
Do they suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Take the trash out.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a Boston map?
Your sister is as wonderful as ever.
This will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed by fear.
Do you like these parfums?
How terrible!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him to work, you should consider his youth.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.
It's his obsessive idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom reluctantly left the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe that.
I was in a white dress.
Check again.
Tom has a son doctor.
I know it won't be possible.
Do you have something from the headache?
Children imitate friends, not parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play outside with his friends.
Whatever happens, keep calm.
Tom sent a message to Mary.
He's always happy.
When Mary reached the bus stop, the last bus was on its way.
Tom's wearing a black coat today.
I'll wait until 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We used to speak French.
Bananas taste good.
They're eating.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they're worthless.
Have you tried talking to them?
It was much harder to do than it seemed.
Her friends made fun of her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I said.
I doubt Tom can win.
The aliens are coming and taking our work away from us, Earth for the Earthers, let's deport the Martians!
Don't worry.
Bell invented the phone in 1876.
You want to go with the train?
Tom said Mary was great.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still sleeping, right?
Is that why you still like Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad and never came back.
Put your toys together.
It was much harder to do than it seemed.
I think I did a good job.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I feel better.
Are these people crazy?
That's why it's interesting.
Have you finished your job yet?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's not hard to do.
Tom's dead.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but taller than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask for your help?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I've never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was difficult.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I wanted to sell it anyway.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't.
You missed something.
I called Tom right away.
You looked interested.
It'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We don't really have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to achieve his goal.
Ken has two cats.
I realized what my mistake was.
I love trips.
The phone's not working.
That's what we want.
Tom's in the sunglasses.
Tom's a good painter.
All you have to do is press the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can you rent a Halloween suit?
Tom's busy, and he can't help you right now.
We're not a couple.
A student wants to see you.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm getting hot.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Tom really thinks someone's listening?
No change!
Tom's nice, I suppose.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I should've gone sooner.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like her?
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's got a grudge.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
You know what I mean?
Tom wasn't rude to me.
How do you say "thank you" in Japanese?
She's asleep.
Tom’s wife asked him to quit his job.
Would you mind opening the door?
Are you comfortable?
This chair is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted an orphan.
I played baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got my ticket for nothing.
You're such an unbearable man.
What's going on here?
Tom said you spoke French.
I did my best.
No, sir, she's free.
I am very interested in studying French.
Be nice to the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight I could borrow from you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't believe anyone.
I'm glad you're happy with your job.
Do you work around here?
You admit it, don't you?
I've got things to do tomorrow.
I'm unholy.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but I grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to not understanding.
I'm sharing everything.
The options are obvious.
The only person Tom ever talks about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was cancelled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom's okay.
I don't sleep well.
Wouldn't you buy that?
Women are beautiful.
Wouldn't it be great if Tom did?
You did it?
I'm having trouble sleeping.
Tom's annoying me sometimes.
I'm a pretty good dancer.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.
It's obviously cheaper for you to spend the night with us.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
I never said no.

You don't have to rush.
What's the boy's name?
I always get up at half by eight.
Is that what I asked you to do?
That's what Tom finally did.

Just keep doing what you're doing.
You made three mistakes.
There is no rule, but there are some exceptions.

I lost my pen.
I'll keep working.
I was at the meeting last night.

I tried to help you.
I didn't try.
No one's taking me to work.
Don't you want to have children?
Iceless tea.
Philosophy is not a thing you can learn for six months.
You want to lose weight?

My father's too busy to go for a walk.
This place should be visited twice.
I'm just going for a walk.
He sells cars.
They were my friends.

Did you live here?
Maybe Tom's tired.
I don't think we can do that.
Tell me because I'll call you back.
We'll try.
Tom shared Mary's pain.
They're sick of playing.
I can't forget her smile.
I hope Tom didn't do what you asked him to do.
I don't like fish.
I'm not who I give up.
I feel tired.
I've got food.
Mary asked Tom to let her drive.
Tom’s excuse was pathetic.
Warsaw is cheaper than London?
I'm ashamed of my bad English.
Are you hungry?
How did you get out of prison?
You can't prove anything.
You're a success.
I have a guinea pig.
You have blue lips.
Who did you go dancing with?
Thank you, I downloaded all six files.

Good work!
My cat is so cute.

He came personally.
I'm really hungry.
Tom died in the same year as Mary.

Did Tom believe that?
Actually, he's never been to New York.
Tom thought Mary and John might be involved in arms smuggling.
I was sober back then.
Here's your turnout.

I'll wait here until he gets here.
Tom can drive.
I read novels on purpose.
I was going to tell Tom, but I forgot.
I'm a hero.
They love us.
I really need your help.
Tom betrayed you.
I got up about six.
I don't want to brag, but I'm pretty smart.
Does it matter?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Tom may not even be on the team.
I ask myself if I can trust him.
What happened to her?
Are you drinking?
I got angry.
When did he arrive?
Where's your teddy bear?
What's up, Tom?
Maybe this year we'll finally win in Europe.
Where could Tom do that?
I think you're wrong.
I'm paying attention.
Do you have a passport?
I was able to forget my wallet.
Cats catch mice.
You can go.
Tom said he wouldn't mind doing it for Mary.
Where's Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I made Tom do it.
What kind of wonder would Tom like to do that?
Birds can see the earth’s magnetic field with their eyes.
Do you need a car?
It's Tom's signature.
What really happened here?
Oh, my God!
Don't come in, I'm naked.
Are you planning on doing this somehow?
Am I clear?
I'm free today.
Tom will probably be punished for doing this.
No matter what, Tom is happy.
There's no need to hurry.
Are you satisfied?
I didn't believe him at first.
The phone's not working right now.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Come inside.

I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.

I know I'll learn a lot.
I went fishing on Monday.

Have you seen his new movie?
I'm good at it.
Why did he quit?
Tom said Mary's gone.
I don't have enough money to buy this.
Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My unbiased idea is that it's a terrible movie.
You're very elegant.
Whatever you want.
I could change.
It's real.
Are you trying to be funny again?

How often do you do that?
I hope you'll come back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
Love can't be bought.
If you didn't want to come, you had to say something.
I'm ready to work.
What kind of theater is this?
Did you see the protein?
Mary said Tom told her.
Tom wasn't a very good witness.
I went to visit my grandmother.
I hate weddings.
I heard the door in the door.
I can't keep up with you.
Mary's a great dancer.
My grandfather's from Osaka.
I want massage, I need to relax.

When do you think Tom's gonna be here?
Is it snowing tonight?
Do you care?
Are you seeing someone here?

You're from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You're good at doing this, aren't you?
These apples taste good.
Can I have your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
