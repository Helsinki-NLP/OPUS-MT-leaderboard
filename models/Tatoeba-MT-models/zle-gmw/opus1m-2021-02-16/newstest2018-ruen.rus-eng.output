Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law imposing administrative liability for the violation of the time and procedure for the payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for State and municipal needs.
This law is intended to address the very acute problem of non-performance by customers in public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation in which entrepreneurs could not receive payment under already executed State and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the Russian President instructed the Office of the Attorney-General of the Russian Federation to take the problem into special control.
Because businessmen themselves could not cope with unfair customers who had entered into unfunded contracts, tried to avoid payment obligations and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has submitted 9,700 submissions, resulting in disciplinary proceedings against 4,500 officials, administrative proceedings against 533 officials, 75 cases of investigation and 46 cases of investigation.
As a result, more than 66 billion roubles were owed to entrepreneurs.
These huge amounts have not been accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multi-billion-dollar contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts have led to huge debts.
Here's the case.
The manager of the small company won a competition for social transport services for several million roubles.
The man invested all his working money, fully fulfilled his obligations, but did not receive the money on time.
The result is an increasing financial coma of salaries, taxes, loans that would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not sought the assistance of the prosecutor.
The problem has now been maximized in a number of regions.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total debt on State and municipal contracts identified by the prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office operates under manual crisis management.
The Attorney-General personally holds visiting meetings with representatives of the local authorities, at which all violations revealed by the prosecutors and measures taken to address them without delay are dealt with.
Such operational meetings have already taken place this year in Yaroslavla and Yekaterinburg.
The implementation of Federal Law No. 189-FZ “On the amendment of the Code of Administrative Offences in order to establish the administrative liability of the employer's officials for the violation of the time and procedure for payment of goods (work, services) in the procurement of public and municipal needs”, signed by the President of the Russian Federation last week, will improve the public customer's pay discipline.
The draft law was drafted by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Attorney-General ' s Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences with an article which provides for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 roubles for breaching the time limit and procedure for payment of goods, works and services by the employer in State and municipal procurement.
If an official had already been administratively punished for a similar offence, he would be disqualified for a period of between one and two years.
All prosecutors of constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure that these legislative innovations are applied in practice.
Civil Rights Unit announced a travel warning in Missouri.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People issued a warning to colored people travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement is as follows: “The warning to travelers of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, valid until 28 August 2017, encourages African American travelers, guests and citizens of Missouri to be particularly careful and cautious in travelling around the state in connection with a number of suspicious racist incidents that have recently taken place throughout the state and which have been brought here.”
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the recent Missouri law, which made it more difficult for people to win discrimination claims, and the fact that State law enforcement authorities disproportionately targeted minorities.
“You are subject to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of their skin colour, beaten and killed,” said Rod Chapel, President of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population of Missouri, newspaper Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints more often than ever.”
This is the first warning of this kind announced by the organization to the U.S. state.
The Group referred to incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at Missouri University and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas on a state trip, and Missouri State Police arrested him without charge of a crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Attorney General of Missouri State that the probability of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for white drivers.
“The aim of the warning is to keep people informed of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri”, said Chapel.
“People must be trained in one way or another, whether they will take the bail money with them or tell their relatives that they are traveling through state territory.”
According to the latest FBI hate crime report, 100 hate crimes were reported in Missouri in 2015, making the state the sixteenth State in terms of the number of such violations.
A travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri State Act, which will make it more difficult to prosecute a legal entity for housing or labour discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued warnings to travelers in Texas and Arizona after these states had enacted new immigration control laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which ACLU believed should have increased the number of racial checks.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Two people died as a result of shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown people fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reporting the Reuters with reference to the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
Two people, including one police officer, were killed and three injured during the shooting.
All wounded have been taken to hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the vehicle, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the intruders was detained and the other managed to escape.
Rostourism supports the law abolishing free baggage for non-return flights
The head of Rostourism, Oleg Safonov, stated in an interview with RBC television channel that “positively” refers to the adoption of a law abolishing the free shipment of baggage on non-return flights.
“There is a need to create conditions under which a person without baggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one with baggage”, he stressed (TASS quote).
Mr. Safonov noted, however, that, despite the fears of citizens, it would not be necessary to pay for the carriage of top clothes and a mobile phone in a handcuff.
"It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and to declare it, to say it's for the top clothes, the umbrella, the mobile phone, the iPad, or even some computer," said the head of Rostourism.
Formerly, Russian President Vladimir Putin had signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the provision of free baggage on a non-return flight.
It is said that airlines can determine for themselves the number of places and weights of baggage included in the non-return tariff.
Vladimir Putin commissioned the elimination of Baikal pollution
Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting on the protection of Baikal, reported that in recent years significant areas of the lake had been severely polluted.
It mandated the identification of sources of funding, plans and implementers to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin has also commissioned a full recovery of contaminated areas.
“There is also a need to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, and most of them have been damaged,” quotes the President's RIA News.
He added that the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation should conduct an investigation into the identification of environmentally harmful activities.
He said that there were problems in the lake area due to the emergence of natural landfills and a number of environmental disturbances by recreational workers.
"I want to emphasize this: not everyone has to check, but the measure needs to be known here too, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and to take appropriate action," he stressed.
The Attorney-General ' s Office had previously reported a decrease in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had proposed an increase in the number of facilities subject to environmental supervision.
Recall that on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, in a direct line, stated that there was a need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of a special security regime.
He was informed of problems in economic activity by the inhabitants of Olhon Island, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The Head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergey Donskaya, immediately proposed a solution to the problem by clarifying the limits of the Baikal water protection zone, but the Buratiy Government recalled that such a change was not sufficient because the restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
Previously, in the Ministry of Economics, a proposal was made to address the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
There will be a new temple in Southera.
In the village of Sosová, members of the community from the minority indigenous peoples of the North, “Rahtnya”, together with the inhabitants of the Berezovsky region, participate in the construction of an Orthodox temple in honour of the saint Nikolai the Miracle.
Its location is the river bank, and the temple will be well seen from a distance, so it will serve as a travel light for fishermen.
According to the community, construction work will be completed this year, the domes are now installed and church bells are available.
The game fleet of the fleet provided transport escorts.
The temple is named after St. Nikolai the Miracle Creator because he is regarded by the Orthodox Church as a patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosova, fishing gives settlers jobs and feeds them.
The locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and the children even write about it in school writings as local sights.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why Singapore’s Laws?
I'm talking to local businessman Chang sitting in a diner in the open air.
In commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, but carefully puts cigarettes in an iron box taken from his office.
After the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn, which is 100 meters up to it, and throws bulls out there.
A fine for garbage in a public place of $500 local, reports Chang.
You know, I've had a reflex since I was a kid. You can't throw a candy fan on the bridge, you'll be fined.
And now there are video cameras everywhere.
And indeed, Singapore's pavements in the middle of the city are clean as if they were in a museum.
Chang says three months ago, an 18-year-old son of his neighbor painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to flogging.
What?!
Imagine that.
He was hit 10 times with a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
We don't get corporal punishment at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standards of living and the most severe laws, the observer of AIF has dealt with them locally.
No one here is thinking of abolishing the death penalty,” explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
For a long time, the government has not cared about the views of both the EU and the US on this.
If a person transports or trades in a large quantity of drugs, he will have a hanging.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian was arrested at Changi airport, carrying 400 g of cocaine.
It was defended by the Australian premiere, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope.
But the guy was eventually hanged anyway.
After that, the drug couriers of our country are diligently traveling around the country.
The point is: Singapore requires laws to respect everyone in a row, not just the modest and the poor.
It doesn't matter if you're a millionaire, a vice-premier, a famous artist or a resident of the EU.
One option is, if they find you a pound of cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you're walking around Singapore and you're seeing a bunch of warning signs everywhere, you just wonder how many bans there are in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and it can be bought strictly by a doctor’s prescription (!).
No gum will be taken from a tourist when he arrives, but if he puts a rubber in the subway, he will be fined $1,000.
In four days, I met two people with white signs around my neck, "I was trashing."
In addition to a fine, the urn’s thrown at the urn is often sentenced to a “purchase to the jars”: cleaning parks and beaches for a week.
6,000 roubles is paid by the “offender” who forgets to wash his water in the public toilet, and when an attempt is made to make a small need in the elevator of the house, a special detector is activated, the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Exotic laws include prohibitions on feeding pigeons on the street, public singing of songs, and even excessive flooding of room plant (!), which are considered to attract mosquitoes.
To avoid fires, smokers are not allowed to carry lighters in the subway, or they will be fined 5,000 Singapore dollars.
Anyway, the thought is, no matter how hard you try, you're gonna break something.
It's not like that, but it's trying to discredit me, Mohammed Kabir-Qajaria, the owner of the local travel agency.
Special fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last 20 years, I haven't seen anyone get involved for violating them.
Why are they kept?
So citizens don't relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
Let's say that if a minor is sold a cigarette in a kiosk, he will be punished in a chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge sum, the intruder himself will be struck with sticks on the back, and the seller will also be beaten and imprisoned.
It is because of such harsh laws that offences are very rare in Singapore.
Is that true?
As early as the 1970 ’ s, we were in chaos on the roads — motorists ignoring traffic lights, driving as they wanted, driving drunk.
After the year's fines were imposed, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, drinking whiskey, knows that if they stop, the policeman will not let go for bribes, impose a fine on the cost of the apartment, and they will be sent to jail for years.
For many foreigners, the city-state in South-East Asia seems to be a form of concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Death Island", a guest from the United States of America, horrified the wealth of the inhabitants, "a frighteningly clean airport" and "cultural nature".
Disclosure, such things are unnatural, they look artificial, and they shouldn't be.
The first days in Singapore, and you're really afraid to throw your paper on the sidewalk, you get caught in the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the Little India area, and suddenly, the pattern breaks, and the bus stops with plastic cups.
"What do you mean?" you wonder.
And like this, the Singaporeans laugh.
Things happen.
Not every crime like that will be caught on the spot, but you should know that if you're identified, you won't get cleaned up because you broke the law.
More often than not, it's enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, Singapore’s power is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh, I traveled very carefully — motorcyclists often take smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
Downtown Paris is full of filthy hobos and beggars.
Not everyone on our streets is trying to throw garbage in the trash.
Singapore, however, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (until the death penalty) laws, has become the most peaceful, clean and secure city on earth.
You'll think about it.
This is the human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one was seated behind the wheel until the fines started.
Although Singapore is not about fines, it is about voluntary enforcement.
And we have to think that in Russia, people would also like to see clean streets, no garbage in the subway, and welcome the arrest of those who mix the elevator with the public toilet.
That's corporal punishment, thank you.
Otherwise, Singapore’s laws are at least worth looking at.
Nothing sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Freedom Statue.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he starts fighting the statues.
The Americans understand this as well as everyone else -- from here to the deliberate theatrical demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of Trump’s key ideologues, no doubt knew what he was doing when he brought the symbolic ax over the Statue of Liberty during a violent dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the President’s proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try the statue himself.
The men of pleasure boat owners and artists who depict the Freedom Statue would lynch him if he tried to do it.
But he tried to make sense of it, and especially of what was attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the monument ended, when Emma Lazarus’s poems were added to the pedestal.
As Miller groaned at Acosta, "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem you're talking about was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller put the facts right, but as he said, it's not really about history.
It's about the current resounding words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming of sighing freely / the miserable waste of your vast shores."
Never before have "unhappily scum" been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature-- he made it clear that in America, Trump didn't expect these people.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus, and her friends, who fought to put her words in the middle of the statues after her death, were very well aware that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to indicate the connection between the French and American republics by means of a banal classical figure, a female image of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract; she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The combination of poems and images was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack against American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right ones changed it back.
Lucid Rush Limbo, a sort of John the Baptizer who announced the arrival of Trump in 2010, reasoned that Freedom did not invite anyone, rather she was an early neoconservative carrying the flames of America lying in the darkness of the world: "Freedom is moving forward.
She carries a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch isn't needed to light the way to the U.S.."
Against the practice of Limbo, it's really a point here.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the point of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by exhausted, unhappy but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
It means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Its statue answers them with the words of hope and hospitality they wish to hear.
And, of course, that's not the prospect Miller and Trump would ever want to admit.
Their torch is not needed to light the road, but to stir up hatred, which is the only source of their power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Blake highly appreciates the Scottish members of the British team.
Aileed Doyle remembers a time when there were only two Scots in the UK.
Neil Blake, director of the United Kingdom Light Athletics Federation, stated that a 16-member Scottish team at the World Cup would make a “significant contribution to the team's game”.
The record number of Scottish light-athles was selected for the 2017 London Championships, which began on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland, something special is born and that the UK Light Athletics Federation should take that into account.
"We know that and we're trying to understand it and we're going to keep it as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
"I spoke to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish Light Athletics Federation thinks that what they've done has to be done.
The British Federation of Light Athletics: What they've done has to be done.
And the people on the street think the same thing.
I don't know why this is happening, but it's brilliant."
Some of the Scottish athletes claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert, who will compete with Sir Moe Farah at a distance of 5,000 metres; and Aileed Doyle has chosen the team as his captain.
"Aileed is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," says Blake.
"Many light-flyers, whether Scottish or not, and wherever they live or practice, left this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Aileed put into it were wonderful."
The winner of the silver medal of the Commonwealth Championship, who will run 400 meters in her fifth World Cup with obstacles, says that 16 Scots in the British team are "unimaginable".
The previous record for the world championship was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Muir, who specializes in the mid-distance race, scored five British and two European records last year.
She'll run at 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who is going to be in the 1500 meters race, is another Scotsman who needs attention: behind his back, he had a successful season in which the British team won the selection competitions and the Annual Competitions.
Doyle recalls his first world championship, when Lee McConnell was the only Scot on the team.
The team captain says she's "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots not only joined the team, but in some cases they'll claim medals and fight for the finals.
"The captain of the team is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that your comrades voted for you and chose you -- for me, it's a very special thing," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who joined the team.
This shows how much we've achieved.
And they are all well-prepared athletes who will seek to reach the pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was pretty good.
I just noticed that we're very lucky to have the World Cup home.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we're going to be back at Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go to his arena and take part in the competition, and the atmosphere would be great."
Blocking critics on Facebook: You don't have to go to public office if you're not ready to listen to voter criticism
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism, of course, annoyed him.
But he didn't shut his critics up.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "We can be taken away from our freedom of speech, and we deaf and dumb will be led as sheep to slaughter."
Now I'm going to go to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should have tried to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's subsidiaries called the lawsuit a nullity, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "so and what."
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people will say.
But it's important, too.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He's an amazingly popular Republican governor in a democratic state.
He's ranked second in the country's 50 governors' approval rating.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He demonstrated a firm hand in managing the state and his commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook as a primary mode of communication with his constituents and shows his bald head on his page after chemotherapy.
It is therefore unnecessary and ultimately harmful to block people who come to the Governor's page -- which is described as an official public forum and administered by the administration on the basis of taxpayers' money.
In an interview with the Washington Post, press secretary Amelia Ches defended the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was just their moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers, and haters who are angry on the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people Hogan blocked.
And these are real people, not trolls, a teacher, a businessman, a pastor, who turn to their chosen leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, informative and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lakshmi's lawyer, Sarma Ramana, from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the section of the commentary to the article in the Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same subject, some people immediately say it's a so-called trick instead of admitting they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
What governor's subordinates call "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "active life-threatening position."
In the Facebook era, it is easy to edit your image simply by blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
It's a much less dusty job than it used to be when it had to send people, collect and burn newspapers with critical headlines, or arrest and silence protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, only in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for refusing to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users, who were booked on his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on this topic was taken this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge of Alexandria, James C. Kasheris, the president of the Laudon County Observatory violated the First Amendment by beating the voter in her Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, the Republican Governor Matt Bevin filed claims against the American Civil Liberties Alliance for his Facebook and Twitter behavior.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington’s era of affordable postal spending, it was about the same as the Internet today.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers had quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters had severely undermined its credibility.
Even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the aliases of Juricola, Valerius, Belizarius and Porcius wrote letters to newspapers that mock Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington Documents online project, his office was overwhelmed by petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lie at the very heart of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty's looking forward to living comforts at the Renaissance Club.
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lotian hosts the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
A Northern Irelander, who was the leader of the Archerfield Links Club next door, and moved towards the final round last year, until he lost to Paul Ilse, was attached to the new site and served as a representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarvadi Club.
“I've seen the Renaissance Club build, and we've seen it succeed with this event,” Rafferty said.
“The players will see this field at its best moment, it is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job doing this place.
He's a strong supporter of this game and proud of his achievements here.
It's a great demonstration for this field.”
The Englishman Ilse looks forward to the opportunity to stand for the first time in his 32-year career, despite the fact that he won both the European Challenge Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"It's really a special feeling," said a Southport player.
"I failed to try to win "Extremadura Open" again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
It's magic to return to this corner of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time, and we will always remember it.”
Returns to the battle in Gary Orr's home country, who joined the European tournament for older athletes after he was 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the 2013 "Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open" tournament.
“When you play at home, it's always a little more important,” said the resident Helensborough Orr.
“You want to speak well, but you feel this extra burden.”
I've played with great pleasure again, and I've shown a good golf.
I'm happy with the way things work so far."
This trio will be joined by the former winners of the Masters tournament, Ian Woosnam, and the major champions for senior athletes, Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former captain of "Ryder Cup" Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmair, and Ross Drummond.
The tournament is free of charge, and the parking lot is 5 pounds an hour if there's one person in the car and 10 pounds if there's two or more people in the car.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
The kind of tunnels above the highways that can absorb carbon monoxide emitted by cars are already being tested on British roads.
The country ' s transport agency reported on the positive results of a 100-metre tunnel test installed on a road in the north of the country, according to Autocar.
A six-metre-high tunnel is constructed of some recent polymeric materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in the vehicle exhaust.
However, building a whole network of tunnels like this is only part of the massive measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British are going to expand the electric vehicle chargers network, implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic, increase the use of commercial electric transport and upgrade the heavy truck fleet.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is related to transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsud changed the penalty for disabled Mamaev to a fine.
Mosgorsud changed the penalty for disabled Anton Mamaev, who had been sentenced to four and a half years in a colony, to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
TASS reports this.
The Public Prosecutor's Office had previously asked the court to change the sentence to a conditional one, explaining its request to the effect that Mamaev's disease “is preventing him from being imprisoned”.
The 28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment in a general-regime colony for robbery against a former Special Forces combatant.
On 19 July, the court released the man from detention at a visiting hearing at SIZO.
Poverty and death in Indonesian “Golden Land”
Bardin Deguei doesn't use a stove when preparing lunch.
She doesn't even use a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County, in the rebel Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually just puts sweet potatoes, which are called a note here, in the furnace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
The Degei sits on the ground floor – she doesn't have any furniture – and that's where she does her housework, like washing her clothes with vague water from a nearby swamp.
The bathroom serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She's the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she wasn't assigned to the field.
It's common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“No one decides to walk in the village after 5:00 p.m.”, she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was joined to Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote in public to raise their hands in front of the occupying forces.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which maintains strict control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Anarotali is a city as remote as an abandoned city; it includes a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Jayapura, the provincial administrative center, to Nabir, and then a five-hour shake in a hired car.
There's no public transport here.
A city with a population of about 19,000 consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust in a variety of red colors.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners, have arrived.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, popuas mee pago worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
“It was unusual for us to wear these clothes,” says Deguei, pointing to his bright, hand-wrapped turban, dark skirt, and bright shirt.
“We used to wear only leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population lives below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold land.
The largest gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran in Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Pania, a high-rise province about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
It was only in 2015 that Freeport produced about $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can boast forest reserves estimated at $78 billion.
These riches, however, cause one misfortune for the Papuas, guaranteeing that the powerful Indonesian armed forces retain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation into The New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local troops and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands for greater autonomy on the part of the Papuas threaten the existence of this golden vein and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papuas have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacres in the indigenous highlands of Papua in the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything,” a report published in 2016 by the Brisbane Diocese contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture – especially, as stated in another report, rape and electric shocks – and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is hard to count the number of victims because the incidents occur every week,” says Andreas Harrison, researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
Gaiks have been protracted as Papua's resources have attracted the influx of displaced persons from other parts of Indonesia.
The 3.5-million population of the province is 83 per cent Christian, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from densely populated Indonesian islands – Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
Yavan shops, “warungi”, sell fried chicken and a mixture of gado-gado vegetables served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to stand up to competition.
“Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the natives of Papua”, explains Abeth Yo, a twenty-four-year-old Paniai, who moved to Jayapur, the provincial capital, for work.
“This has resulted in the loss of the market for indigenous Papuans, Mother-Mama (Women) of Papua.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, known as the Jokovi people, vowed to address inequalities and violations of rights in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the President's Palace in Jakarta, a former carpenter obtained support from 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But there has been little change in Papua, and locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, expecting him to fulfil our hopes for justice,” Yow says.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Jokowi Paniai survived a tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street singing Christmas anthems at a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the dark.
The frightened children told them they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, one soldier was offended by their tone and returned with four soldiers some time later.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk chased children and beat them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Emo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a government office nearby, and the next day the situation escalated.
About a thousand popois men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed the White, the pago dance of the popuas, running in circles and playing bird singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation escalated, soldiers were ordered on internal radio communications to “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them”, as claimed in an official document that was seen by Time magazine correspondents but not published in local media.
The 50 - year - old Jeremias Kayama, head of the Kogo Koto district in Enarotali, felt the danger and called for calm, asking the crowd to leave their homes.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I turned around, a bullet suddenly hit my left wrist,” he told the magazine “TIME”, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but he says the bullet came from the shreng of the soldiers gathered.
"There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots," he adds.
A local resident of Alfius Jowa was shot three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, said.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” Johns, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told the magazine “TIME”.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General Yotge Mende, Chief Inspector of the Papua Police, told reporters that his officers were merely "protecting" their base because it was attacked.
“We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said the police spokesman of Papua Commissioner Pujo Sulistio in 2015.
“It's a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and far more wounded.
The news about the murders only got to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi gave a fervent speech in Jayapur expressing condolences to the victims' families and vowing to address the historical abuse of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be settled immediately, never again in the future”, he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security, Viranto, said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately, we made excuses.
“Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s or at the beginning of zeros.
The point is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed,” he said.
Then Viranto retracted his words when he spoke to the magazine “TIME” on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he did not plan to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All things will be decided through the courts."
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people during the bloody East Timor independence vote in 1999, said that 11 human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims from Paniai faced such statements with a gloomy distrust.
“In the past three years, I have been questioned four times, but there has been no change at all,” says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later, he's still living in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
“I'm afraid I'm going to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'm going to be shot.”
His brother Jacobus also expressed the view that the residents of Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“The soldiers came after me after we buried the bodies,” he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in the nearby Pania district of Deyay.
In a confrontation between the villagers and the construction company manager, who refused to help bring a man unconscious to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
A 25-year-old man, Ravianos Dove, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company’s construction site office.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at officers who responded with warning shots.
But the locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian SWAT) started shooting at the crowd and killed one man.
“We were in such a panic, we were afraid of retaliation,” reported the 29-year-old Domingue Badia magazine, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded rushed in.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament demanded that officers involved in the incident be called to account and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Paniai has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is a source of dissatisfaction among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the green central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the “Movement for Free Papua” (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Pope by launching sporadic attacks and raids with kidnappings against Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Thadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Komia.
As a response, in recent years thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai and arbitrarily detained by the military under the pretext of “protecting national independence”.
Some of them never came back.
Among the population of Papua Paniai, it is considered “a sad, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
The bread is equally unavailable.
People here grow everything they eat, mostly a note, as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the crop for the family, and the rest is sold locally.
Ten tubers cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, there has been an increase in economic inequality between indigenous papuas and new migrants who have arrived in large numbers since the introduction of new flights to Nabir airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually held by more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papoeas rarely have enough money or skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no work or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
The isolation keeps Papua away from the eyes of the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of the international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudie and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for “inconsistencies with the organizations concerned” despite having been granted rare permissions to film.
According to Felim Keene, Deputy Director for Asia, Human Rights Watch, promises made during the Jokovi campaign to lift media restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“At present, foreign journalists trying to report from rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua face new dangers: visa denial and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua ' s immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands – requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “diverse and widespread violations” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have backed OPM in the past.
A representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramanata Nasir, rejected the group's statement, informing journalists in Jakarta that “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations”.
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Netherlands Human Rights Ambassador, Kiis Van Ba ' ar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, the local people broke their silence, begging, “We want freedom”, as the source claims, who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but the Papuas say they're unlikely to vote for Jokovi again.
“Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting,” says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the residents of Paniai, apart from living in the shadow of a threat from the greedy army, are in poverty, and their education and health care are in a miserable state.
Gobay says that the Paniai people, like other Papuas, consider their voice given to Jokowi as a debt that he must pay.
“They don't want money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the latest symbolic act of disobedience, burying the body of one of the victims on a plot of land opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice is likely never to be done, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” says Jacobus without raising his head.
"What else were we supposed to do?"
The second fire covers the Dubai skyscraper "Fakel"
The fire covered one of the world's highest skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of people to leave the 75-story structure 337 metres high.
It's the second fire that went through the high-rise building – which, by coincidence, is called the "Fakel" – in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no operational news of the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” told Reuters by a skyscraper called George.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Authority, fire brigades extinguished the fire around 4:00 local time (00:00 Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide asylum to victims.
The incident could put the security of materials used in high-rise exteriors around the world on the agenda.
In an investigation by the Fackel administration following a fire in 2015, it was found that the most affected was the laundering — the outer panels used for the fabrication and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the isolation system and the cry panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could have accelerated the spread of the fire that had taken place there in June, resulting in the death of some 80 people.
The increase in the tourist flow to Ida Viruma in June was minimal
A total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, or 0.6 per cent more than in the same period, benefited from the data received by the correspondent for the rus.err.ee portal from the Department of Statistics in June 2017.
However, the number of local tourists has decreased and the number of foreign tourists has increased.
In June, for example, the foreign tour flow increased by 7.3 per cent (544) to 7,994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The region has seen the most significant increase in the number of Russian tourists - 8.9 per cent or 318 more than in June 2016.
A total of 3,885 visitors from the Russian Federation stayed at the Ida Viruma Hotels in June 2017.
Andrej Malakhov made it clear to his fans who were responsible for his departure.
Andrei Malakhov insinuated his fans at Instagram who was responsible for leaving Channel One.
So far, he hasn't commented on the rumors, but today he posted a piece of an article in the newspaper Vedovosti on August 1.
Malakhov signed a "boss sucker" tag.
An article on how to prevent an employee from “burning out” and to pay attention to his condition.
When you recall the numerous reports that the host failed to get in touch with the new producer who was going to reformulate "Let's Talk," it becomes clear what he so transparently insinuated, writes "CP".
Andrei Malakhov, a television director, was reportedly currently on leave and had not signed an application for dismissal from Channel 1.
The dismissal situation could be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five military personnel were killed in a car explosion
At least five soldiers died in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, transmitting the RIA News.
According to the police, a mined vehicle exploded the night before the military roadblock in Girishk County.
We know about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new emergency took place in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The shooting between the assailants and the security forces continues.
Dyver filmed a shark who bit his camera.
Dyver and researcher Greg Skomal captured a video shark that bit his GoPro action camera.
Rolik posted a branch of the United States Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, an official of Scomal, on Facebook.
The incident took place on 2 August off the coast of the Cape Cod peninsula in the northeast of the United States, clarifying the Necn portal.
The man tried to take the shark off the camera he was holding on a special stick during the submarine voyage.
After seeing the man, an animal over three meters long sailed toward him.
The shark began to bite the camera without trying to attack the scientist.
Scomal explained that the predator did the same to determine whether the gadget was eaten.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also observed that the behavior of the marine animal was new to scientists.
The cause of the mass fight in the Ural military center became known.
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military Region arrived at the Yelan Training Centre, where a mass fight took place to investigate the incident.
Some details of this assault have already come to light.
According to Mash, which appeared on the VKontakte page, contractaries of U.S. military unit number 31612 fought violently because of an unfilled bed.
The beginning was that a private named Sayan demonstrated his disregard for the officer's order to refuel the sheet.
The officer was sided by soldiers from the sixth company.
Sayana supported the first company.
Within half an hour, 140 young guys were smashed into beds and sinks in the barracks, smashed glass.
More than 10 people were injured in a mass fight.
The CSB denied the information about the scissors.
The study found that at least one fifth of the passengers in the United States carry prohibited items on a plane.
The study found that more than 20 per cent of passengers knowingly or accidentally carried prohibited items on board the aircraft through the U.S. Transport Security Administration inspection points, including a minimum of 6 per cent boarding the aircraft with prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later found that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., covering over 1,000 people also showed that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to fly with something that was banned by the ATB, 19.7 per cent were milleniums compared to less than 15 per cent of the X generation.
Consciously passing by the ATB officers, food and water are the most commonly delivered.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they had deliberately searched sharp objects, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted to knowingly carrying banned drugs on the plane.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them had accidentally been smuggled through airport searches and how many had done so knowingly.
It is well expected that most often, knowingly or unconsciously, smuggles through searches of those most flying.
According to the company, the ATB rules are rather complicated and complicated.
People often don't know exactly what kind of fluids they can transport or how much they can transport.
So it's not surprising that most of what the ATB takes are banned liquids.
Some time ago, people thought the ATB might consider the book to be illegal.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Chapter EPA Prewitt refuses to delay the implementation of Obama's emission reduction rules
The day after the 15-state lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to postpone the implementation of Obama’s regulations to reduce emissions of air pollution and smog.
Prueitt explained his decision by saying that his agency now listens more to the needs of state environmental regulators than to previous administrations.
He did not mention the claim against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute took place around the date of 1 October, by which the States should ensure that the 2015 ozone standards were met at the land level.
In June, Prueitt announced that it would postpone compliance for one year to give its department more time to study the plan and avoid “incompatibility with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Prewitt, who, before being appointed President Trump for his current post, was the Attorney General of Oklahoma State, was long known as a consistent adversary to the tightening of environmental standards.
After moving to Washington, D.C., Pruitt repeatedly blocked or postponed the imposition of regulations opposed by the chemical or gas oil industry.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal failure of the Puitt return to old standards.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay compliance with the Obama administration’s rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, by drastically changing the course for ozone standards, he simply complied with the obligation of EPA to cooperate with the states in the integrated process of timely implementation of the new standards.
“In previous EPA administrations, it was often impossible to meet the deadline, then waited for claims from activists and others, and discussed the time frame in the course of the settlement of the case”, said Pruitt, who had filed more than a dozen claims against EPA in his previous post.
“We do not believe in regulation through trials, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take our statutes seriously and the authority that it gives us."
However, the EPA statement states that Prewitt may at some point again use his “delay powers and other statutory powers” to make sure that the rules of “jcyjdfis” are in a clear course and on all available information.
The Republicans in Congress are insisting on a broader revision of the ozone rules.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, aims to postpone compliance with the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this matter.
The Attorney General of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that filed an EPA lawsuit this week, said that the group intended to continue legal pressure.
"The changes in the course of EPA -- after our lawsuits -- are an important victory in the struggle for health and safety for 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who have been directly affected by their cities," said Schneiderman.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C.
Ground level ozone occurs when conventional pollutants from machinery, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources react with sunlight in the atmosphere.
This can cause serious respiratory problems in people who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health and environment advocates welcomed the unexpected change in Pruitt's course.
"It's hard to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from a man who's supposed to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Anne Bird of the Biodiversity Center.
"We must continue to resist Trump's ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."
Congress IAAF extended the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Light Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics (UFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAAF WFLA Rehabilitation Council, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension be retained.
166 persons voted for the suspension, against 21, handing over TASS.
The IAAF board report stated that WFLA had made significant progress towards achieving the conditions established by the re-membership board, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the WFLA at the London World Cup, Russian light-athletes were forced to fly a neutral flag.
The team was joined by 19 people who were admitted to IAAF.
WFLA was permanently disqualified by IAAF in 2015.
The report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was then published, describing numerous violations of the WaDA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
For more information on the latest report of the IAAF board, see "IAAF has extended the sanctions against VFL".
Reciprocal defeat
Within the framework of the third round of the Fonbeth-First Russian Federation, the newoskovsky "Kymik" played a retreat against the FC "Kaluga".
A little more than 10 days ago, the rivals played in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
The Chemiker did not give in to the opponent, but the second-hand relaxation at the end of the match led to an insulting goal and a fiasco.
After a recent defeat from the Kalujans with a score of zero, many predicted a simple victory for the masters.
Since the beginning of the meeting, however, the new Ukrainians have forced themselves to be considered and acted against the defence, but from a position of force.
In one inch, the Kalujans were more built and had the advantage of owning the ball.
Another very high-quality match was held by Alexei Syrotine, who repulsed dangerous blows several times and gave his partners confidence in his actions.
Unfortunately, there was not enough effort and luck in the Chemic attack to put the Kalugi's defenses at a standstill and strike the first goal on the road.
After the break, the game began to take off courses.
The New Scouts are more active in the attack.
The alarming calls for our team were defense errors that allowed the Calucians to create a number of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, the Chemic intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out a number of dangerous attacks.
But Calucian's experience has played a role -- they've done the ending in a more literal and cold-blooded manner, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, the Chemic moved the ball to the corner, the pitch of which was passed to the gates by the field owners without resistance.
The goal was written by Yuri Dubrovin.
At the reporting meeting, Chemic demonstrated a pretty good game, but suffered an unfortunate defeat.
Another departure awaits our team: on 11 August, at 7 p.m., in Moscow, in the "Torpedo" stadium of Edward Streltsov, the newoskov will fight with the favorite of the "Centre" FC "Ararat", composed of Roman Pavluchenko, Marat Izmaillov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come back to support the Chemiker!
The venue and time of the meeting of the New Moscows are 6.30 p.m. outside the Magnolia store (East, D.2, Corp.
Composition of the Chemica: Syrotin, Manohin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogya (Oreshkin), Dudayti, Rizov, Saintov, Belyan (Adojevtsev), Andreychenko (Lygin)

According to published phone transcripts, Trump pressed Mexico about paying for the border wall.
The Washington Post published telephone transcripts between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone conversation with President Enrique Peña Nyeta Trump of Mexico, he insisted that he should stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The U.S. President was beating him for publicly speaking against the wall, and according to what he said, he said to him, "You can't talk to the press."
Trump started his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and swore that he would make Mexico pay for the project.
His first telephone conversation with the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was also deciphered by a violent altercation.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the US should accept refugees going to Australia was “a funny,” “a lousy” and “dupo”, and insisted that because of the agreement concluded by Obama’s administration, he would look like an idiot because he intended to stop resettling refugees to the US.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation of all day”.
The bodies of those who died in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to Petersburg.
A plane belonging to the Russian airline, carrying the bodies of the dead Russians in Abkhazia, flew at 8:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, and handed over TASS.
At the point of departure, members of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the town hall, will meet on board, and the Deputy Minister for Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia, Astamir Ahba, will tell the journalists.
In the past, representatives of the MES of the Republic stated that all the costs associated with the return of the bodies to Russia had been borne by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to compensate the families of the victims in the amount of 500,000 roubles.
According to Ahba, the Abkhaz leadership had expressed its willingness to pay the relatives of the victims of the bombings for travel and residence in the Republic, but the relatives had only sent to the Republic the power of attorney to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On 2 August, at about 16:20 Moscow time, two explosions broke out in the village of Primorsky Gudautsk in the Ministry of Defence ' s armoury, after which large-calibre shells and other ammunition were detonated.
As a result, the warehouse was set on fire, causing uncontrollable shell explosions of various modifications.
As a result of an emergency, two Russian citizens, Elena Polakova of 1970 and Elena Timothy of 1962, who were on vacation near a hydrogen sulfide source, were killed.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were taken to the health facilities of the Republic with varying degrees of injury.
Currently, seven people remain in the hospital and the rest are discharged.
A grand jury will study the Russian influence on American elections.
Special Prosecutor for Russia, Robert Müller, convened a grand jury in Washington to study Russia's influence on the US President's election in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to examine witnesses under oath.
The materials collected will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to be charged.
Calling a grand jury gives Muller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the topics of the jury investigation, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son of Donald Trump's then presidential candidate with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselenitsk.
In June 2016, Mueller himself promised to verify the details of this meeting.
They've already been examined by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded his legal staff.
Trump Jr. had previously told me that he had been waiting for a compromise on a candidate's headquarters from the Hillary Clinton Demparty, but that no documents had been presented to expose him, and that it was about adoption.
At the beginning of August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr.'s statement that he had met with Veszlenica was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House said the president didn't dictate anything, but he just used his authority to do what any father would do.
Vice Mayor Penza was detained in the workplace.
The Deputy Chief of Administration of Penza, Irina Shirchina, has been detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigation Committee at her workplace, reporting to RIA Novosty.
No official reports have yet been received from the law enforcement authorities on this matter, but the UK Press Service has assured that they will soon follow.
There's no comment on what happened at Penza City Hall.
Irina Shirchina is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has been responsible for urban planning and land relations since April 2015.
Prior to that, she had worked for a long time as the head of the Office of the State Sylvesttech Inspectorate in the Pensen Region.
Irina Shirzyna is raising three minor children, and it is remarkable that once again as a mother a year ago, she gave up maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, Mexico has no launch vehicle or launch vehicle.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bra is a tribute to the first person to be in space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period that are being demolished in some countries, Gagarin’s monuments are, on the contrary, “walking on the planet”.
In 2012, a monument was erected in American Houston near NASA's former headquarters.
In London, a monument was erected on the Royal Observatory to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the first flight to space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in Erfut, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlov Varach (Czech Republic) avoided demolition in 1992 because of public protests and was moved from the centre of the city to an area outside the local airport.
In the year of the 70th birthday of Gagarin, a monument to Yurius Gagarinsu appeared in Riga.
That's the name and name of the first astronaut in Latvian, and he looks like he's 70 years old.
Morse Ford's murder: activists will lose Lynch's courts on stage to call for justice.
"Ford Mercury" in 1948 passed by the spectators in Monroe's village in Georgia State and rushed roaringly to the Morse Ford Bridge.
When a car carrying four black passengers and a white driver approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns prevented it from going.
The boss, a middle-aged man in a suit wearing a thin strip, pulled a cigar and looked through the windshield.
The insiders trembled with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" a man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
The piercing screams broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Luckily, this horrible scene that took place on July 22 is just a mockery.
But when Roger was put on a loop around his neck, almost all the audience really held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to replay the night that the puppets lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm, and George and May Murray Dorsey, in 1946.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's amazing that in all these years no person has been arrested -- although we see them next to us; although we know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the performance.
"It's a stain on our story and it's a stone on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of Georgia's Congress who's been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to Monroens that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want investigations, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he says.
"We can't move on to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of one of the lynching victims at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records received by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights defenders say that in the city, two linked motives of vigilantes were always well known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ' s ruling allowed for the first time black citizens to vote on the primary that was due to take place in the summer.
About the same election, according to the FBI, black user Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that according to rumours in town, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy’s wife, and that the baby she was supposed to have wasn't from her husband.
According to FBI reports, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 bail to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they were driving from prison and approaching Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and directed Harrison's murders," that's what the FBI has to say in one of the reports.
"It is also obvious that there was a collusion between state and city law enforcement agencies who not only participated in the murders but also destroyed the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt at voting rights," he says.
"They were all killed to send a message to the blacks in town: if you register and vote, you'll be the same."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Greene runs an annual performance that reproduces that lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visible, he captures the audience and speaks of the deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer in America.
It's hard to see and even harder to turn around, but Green thinks that's what matters.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own uglyness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I've been through."
This year's rehearsal began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors -- a dozen whites, the rest of the blacks -- gathered in the room and listened to the years-old review of the play.
Wade Marbo was director with Greene.
He's been the main member of the clan for several years, but he says it's never been easier.
"I think I'm dirty because it's not the man I am," Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at that time."
Indoor actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Ruscon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
Spectal begins with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Screaming back to Ruscon.
There's a blow.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all black actors) gets a laugh.
Green laughs louder than anyone else.
"What's going on" asks Ascon.
He's concerned and embarrassed.
Am I overreacting?
"No," says Greene through the laughter.
"I just don't think white people said nigga."
"Yes, yes," laughs one of the black performers.
"You have to say hard 'r'."
And the energy in the room is changing, and the discomfort changes with the sense of partnership.
Everyone has to do the right thing, not just for the play, but for the memory of the four dead.
The scene starts over.
This time, when Rascona says the word "n," it's clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of actors and sings Billy Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is broken through a word.
A hundred yards away, half a hundred viewers are wiped out of their eyes with tears and sweat.
There are almost equal numbers of blacks and whites among the audience.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York, to watch the show; many live very close.
They all endured Georgia's heavy perfume for almost eight hours while Brooks led them to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, the murder has remained history, but now that they're standing in the same place as lynching people, it seems like their ghosts are in the air right now.
When the last note of the song is silenced, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
The children bow to their heads, touch the blood paint, and the stationary bodies, and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy whispers, as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene thanks the audience, and all of a sudden it's over.
Actors throw ropes off their necks and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main doll.
Nick Ruscona hugs two other actors and suddenly, weeping, falls into their arms: the emotional pressure of the performance finally hit him.
"It's all right," whispers one of the women.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had your reasons for that."
Later, the audience sits down for dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta lively discusses the performance with the black couple they just met.
Denisa Daplinski hardly finds words to describe how she feels after the show.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, scary words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"I think the lynchings are still happening," she adds, "but now it's called what the police are shooting."
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, received general attention.
He says he's already started planning next year's show.
"The performance inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we've been through, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it."
The court fined Navalny for irregularities on the "Agitation Saturday"
The Simonov Court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny 300,000 roubles for violating the organization of the rally.
The opposition was found guilty of an administrative offence under article 20.2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, “Recurring the organization of the rally”.
Earlier, Judge Hizir Moussakayev of the Moscow Court of Simonov had concluded the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, chief of staff of the opposition, Alexei Navalny, who had been brought to justice under the same article as Navalny.
Volkoff was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In this amount, Judge Moussakayev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the “agitation Sabbath”, which Navalny's supporters held in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
Upon seeing the agitated material, the officers who followed the Sabbath were of the opinion that the organizers of the event had deliberately concealed its true nature, a public action (which requires prior authorization from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Amalgamazouev applied for the termination of the administrative proceedings because of the absence of an offence and indicated that the police had made certain errors in the drafting of the report.
Volkov was not detained on the “agitative Sabbath” itself, but he received a summons to appear at the police station to report on an event with his active participation.
The same summonses were received by Navalny and another fellow oppositionist, Nikolai Laskin.
In Mordovia, a bride and three wedding guests were arrested.
A court in Mordovia arrested a local citizen who shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported to the National Bureau of the Investigation Committee.
The incident took place on the evening of July 29.
During the fighting, 42-year-old Saranska shot several visitors to the village pond to swim.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), article 30, paragraph 3, and article 105, paragraph 2 (a), (a), (e), (and) (an attempt to kill two or more persons committed in a generally dangerous manner for hooligan reasons).
According to Interfax, the local media reported that the man had opened fire because the wedding guests decided to swim through his precinct to the water pond.
Minergo will tighten the requirements for turbine suppliers for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, such as turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines, hydroelectric turbines, refineries and oil production are launched, equipment suppliers will be required to share data on access with Minergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The draft Government Regulation has already been prepared and submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will only affect the “critical energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
The document identified potential threats such as obtaining information and access to the facility by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and entities, unfaithful partners and hackers.
The EU expanded anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
On 4 August, the EU Press stated that the anti-Russian sanctions had been extended because of the Simens Turbines scandal in Crimea.
This was previously reported by "Arguments of the Week".
The EU Council Press stated that the sanctions against the Russian Federation had been increased because of the Simens Turbines scandal, which had allegedly been brought to Crimea to circumvent the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
It was previously reported that the final decision would be taken before the end of the day, and that the decision had been taken, and the sanctions against Russia had been extended.
Pearson reduces 3,000 more jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, a British education group, Pearson, announced that it would reduce an additional 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of provisional dividends by 72 per cent in connection with the launching of another restructuring programme aimed at addressing the challenges facing their businesses.
These job losses, which, according to John Fallon’s head of company, will mostly take place in late 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to the 4,000 jobs that were shortened during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it planned to reduce spending by another 300 million pounds (US$ 394 million) in May under a third cost reduction programme to try to bring back the business that had been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning methods.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said that its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced an increase of 1 per cent in sales of the main product in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: Nato soldier killed in a suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, as reported by NATO.
According to unconfirmed local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the town of Karabakh.
This explosion is the last of the bloodsheds that struck Afghanistan this month: on Tuesday, more than 30 people died in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, a Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by an “human-borne improvised explosive device”.
All the wounded are reported to be in stable condition and to be treated at the United States military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is the main source of concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to UN reports, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, and about 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, the suicide bombing caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed that they had launched the attack.
On May 31, a powerful explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people – the most serious human casualties in the country since the United States-led military withdrew the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence emphasizes the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump assesses whether there is a need to increase the number of U.S. military forces providing assistance to troops and police in the country.
According to correspondents, the attacks in Kabul over the past weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its course of conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
Environmental Protection Agency, after legal action, overturns the decision to postpone the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The American Environmental Protection Agency overturned the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama-era law, which requires states to limit air-polluting emissions one day after 15 states have sued the agency because of this step.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “Ozone 2015 measurements”, stressing that this step showed the agency’s willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue and sensitivity with our partners in the states”, said the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone ozone measurements at which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet more stringent air purity standards by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, along with the Federal District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit alleging that this intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to reverse the wide range of environmental regulations introduced by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader programme aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has led to resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency website says that the use of ozone-containing air for breathing “can worsen the function of the lungs and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as as asthma.
The European Business Association opposed new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with the US economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and employment.
The AEB statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be limited.
The European business brings together more than 500 companies from the EU and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of State and Government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new course of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
The deputies ask the police to restrict traffic on the riverside in Pskov.
The Pskov People ' s Choices sent a message to the UVD Chief of the City of Sergei Surin concerning the problem of movement along the Great River River.
Members of the Gordum, Constantine Bolotin, Gregory of the Parties, and Valery Lesnikov, believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, driver control would help to make the area safer and safer.
The problem is that violators ignore the signs of the “Pedestrian Road” and ride freely on the riverside.
As a result, major repairs and improvements have been made in vain.
The sports and children's playgrounds are getting uncomfortable because of the cars.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, the Central Coast Patrol is patrolled by the PPS motor vehicle and the liners in the evenings.
They reduce the number of vehicles passing, but do not stop.
Putin asked the investigating authorities not to remove hard drives.
Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that the investigative authorities should not be allowed to remove servers and hard drives from working computers at the enterprises.
This was stated by the Head of State at the meeting on investment programmes in the Far East.
According to the President, “the application of measures leading to the suspension of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from computers and servers, should be excluded in the interest of investigation”.
Putin noted that if the investigators had such a need, “it is sufficient to remove copies, assure them and use them during the investigation”.
The Head of State added that no “conditions should be created to prevent the continuation of the enterprise's activities until it is impossible to pay taxes”.
Olga Bouzova told me how much she wanted to call her ex-husband.
Olga Bouzova, a television talker, admitted that she wanted to call former football husband Dmitri Tarasov.
At present, the celebrity is located in the United States, where it deals with business matters.
Just the day before Olga visited Las Vegas, she decided to publish a post on the Instagram social network.
She reported that she had not married, had not taken new tattoos, nor had she called her ex-husband to say that he had ruined her life, although she was very eager to do so.
Bouzova said she'd remember this trip forever because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played Cornelius Faj's Minister of Magic in filming a series of Harry Potter novels, died in 1992.
This was reported by the Independent on Thursday.
His family told him about the actor's death.
According to them, he lived “a huge life of success in film, theatre and television for 70 years of his career”.
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theater, he played with Lawrence Olivier in the Coriolan Tragedy.
Hardy was also remembered by the repeated performance of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of the screenshots of Agatha Christie's works about Miss Marple.
For his role in the BBC "Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years" (1981), Churchill was awarded the British Academy of Film and Television (BAFTA) prize.
Robert Hardy has also been the President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, on several occasions.
Something was rotten in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean Andre, Count de Laborde, refused to be buried with her crowning wife, Queen Margrethe.
It's a gold wedding this year, but on the agenda of the couple, it's not the preparations for the celebrations, it's a big argument.
His highness renounced the title of the consort prince, and he insulted the queen that she had never given him the title of the consort king.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains officially the wife of the Queen.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on Washington to stop taunting Moscow
In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, the Russian Federation reacted to Mike Pens’ statements accusing Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was circulated by the foreign policy department some time ago.
In its comments, the MFA indicated that the United States is increasingly using cold-war strains that are inadequate to the present-day reality.
Russian diplomats also called on the United States authorities to stop taunting the Russian Federation.
As the "Arguments of the Week" wrote the day before, US Vice President Mike Pens accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Western Balkans and organizing a failed government in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko are meeting for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive match.
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seem to be moving steadily towards the most exciting boxing match of up to £147 in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unfailing World Boxing Council champion, walked through the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization champion in the second half of the weight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over the four-weight world champion, Erian Broner, on Saturday on Showtime, both boxers are in the top five, regardless of the weight categories.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Miguel Marriga on Saturday at 7 p.m. on the ESPN channel.
When the boxers pose for the photo, manager Lomachenko Egis Clemas noticed that the potential decisive fight between them would be very good.
“I used to be a lightweight,” Garcia reminded me.
"I'm up for Broner's sake [up to £140], but I'm not that big.
I'm a little short for 140.
I want to go down to the light.
And he needs to get up to half a pound, and then we'll have a fight.
That's what fans want.
Let's do it for them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boks needs this fight."
Climas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through PPV as part of his strategy to have Lomachenko perform his debut match at a weight of 135 later this year to schedule a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, who is also interested in fighting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the title of the world champion in light weight in the Forum arena on 23 September.
“The fight may be at the PPV because all the fans have asked for it,” Garcia said, expressing later a willingness to fight the channel that offers the best financial terms.
“We are the main names.
No other names will bring such an interest.
As soon as they're ready...”
Garcia said that he considered Lomachenko to be a great boxer, and that he might attend his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko did not immediately give Garcia praise and said he thought the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry, Mikey... you asked for a knockout."
Garcia said he focused on showing the force of the strike, and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension growing before their own battle.
“This fight must take place.
No other fight is so much of an interest and talk.
I am more than happy to work on it,' said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for one of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
On several central streets, Moscow will be shut down for the weekend.
This weekend, on 5 and 6 August, traffic will be restricted in the capital, on the section of Tver Street, from the Nastasian alley to the Triumphal Square, as well as on the 1st Tver-Yama Street.
In addition, the passage will be closed on the Leningrad Prospect, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tver-Yama Street.
At all sites, the closure will operate on both strips, as reported by the information centre of the Transport Department of Moscow.
The streets will be closed from midnight on 5 August to 5 a.m. on 7 August due to improvements.
Also on weekends, traffic will be closed at the Moscow Coast.
There's still the construction of the charge park.
Putin asked the Attorney General to check on Baikal.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation to inspect the territory of Baikal for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
“Request Genprokuratura to check the Baikal territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities”, stated Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the environmental development of the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked for action if the facts of the violations were found.
New test results published to assess the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden
Recent tests of asylum-seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new medical age assessment method, show that more than 80 per cent of the tests were assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not all trust the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment in the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the real age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of the tests were estimated to be 18 years old or older, and in 25 other cases, the forensics agency estimated that the test was “probably 18 years old or older”.
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was “probably less than 18”.
Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of a person is questionable.
According to Johan Geransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with those of the past months.
“We don't see much difference in statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate,” he said to the “The Local” portal.
The high proportion of cases in which persons were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, it was “most likely to be 18 years old or older”.
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, a person had openly declared that 18 were being implemented this year.
The medical age assessment method of X-raying the teeth of wisdom and tomography of the knee joints and giving them to dentists and radiologists has also led to criticism in some authorities.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Caroline Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing human biological maturity to determine whether they have experienced puberty earlier or later.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don't think we should use the measurement methods that are being used now.
The biological age is thus very inaccurate.
If we cannot define it with certainty, we should not pretend to do what we can,” he said to the newspaper “Metro.”
However, Göransen of the Forensic Medicine Agency argued in favour of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, the risk of a child being mistakenly assumed to be an adult is low.
We face the greatest risk when the human being is about 18 years old, in which case it is about 10 per cent.”
I'll see if I can run for president.
During his work trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin was willing to consider whether he would run for the presidency of Russia in 2018, and he would hand over Interfax.
This statement was a response to the request made by the inhabitants of the village of Cheremushka in the Buryatsk region.
During a video conference on the elimination of the Buraya and Irkutsk fire, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: “Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election comes, we all ask you to run for that office again.”
"Okay, I'll think about it, thank you," the president replied.
On 28 July, President Dmitry Peskov’s press secretary commented on some media statements that Vladimir Putin’s election headquarters would be headed by President Anton Vineaux, head of the administration of the Russian Federation.
Sandov called these assumptions "nothing based on hypothetical reasoning."
"As long as there is no headquarters, until the establishment of the headquarters is far, far from the election campaign," said Peskov.
"Until it's on the agenda," said Sandov.
Governor of West Virginia said he was moving to another party.
Governor of West Virginia, Democratic Party representative Jim Justice announced on Thursday, during a rally with President Trump, that he was moving to another party.
“Do you like it or not, the Democrats have turned away from me,” said Governor Justice.
“Today I speak to you with many prayers and many reflections... today I say to you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of any use to you as a democratic governor.”
The rally exploded with applause.
“So tomorrow I will change my registration to a Republican,” Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you that the time to play is different."
Trump had previously promised that an important statement would be made at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia with a 42-per-cent win, and Justice did not support the Democratic Party candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement on Thursday evening that “the transition of Governor Justice to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more of a hindrance than working to make our country great again.”
“Taking into account only 15 governors and controlling the lowest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice’s statement is just another renunciation of a party that has no top-down leaders and is unable to find positive, unifying messages,” reported CBS News, a representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronna McDaniel.
A heavyweight cat named Mr. Beauty found the house thanks to social media.
A pet in Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., built a cat named Mr. Beauty weighing more than 14 kilograms after he became famous because of the Internet.
It's reported by Massable.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was published on Facebook, asking him to find his owner, because "it's obviously someone who used to feed him."
In comments, users noted that the expression of animal face could become a new meme.
The publication has attracted more than 3.2 thousand liquor and 15,000 comments.
In their comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to shelter Mr. Beauty.
As a result, it was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to take over her weight.
In an interview with WNCN, an American woman said that she had had a similar experience: she took a cat home weighing about 10 kilograms, and now she weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
The animal photograph post has collected more than 68,000 views.
Commentators noted that she could have made a career in the model business.
Coe praised Russia's “really” apology for the doping scandal
The international athletic expert Sebastian Coe praised on Thursday what he called sincere apologies from Russia for the doping scandal, but reiterated that this was not the time to allow the country to participate again in sports.
The Russian representative of the Light Athletics Federation, Dmitri Schlachtin, reported at the Congress of the International Association of Light Athletics Federations, which was held on the eve of the World Championship in Light Athletics, that his country’s exclusion from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who had stolen gold and silver medals at the competition”.
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Light Athletics Federations voted to retain the suspension imposed in November 2015, after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the evidence of State-funded use of doping.
“I thought today’s answer, today’s report was very sincere,” said the President of the International Association of Light Athletics Federations Cow to reporters.
“The whole council and Congress enjoyed... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it has experienced extremely hot times and is now doing everything in its power to take care of the restructuring of the Federation.”
Koh said that he also “liked” that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reconstruction.
“I believe that this has been a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that this is not the time to restore Russia's rights,” Koe said.
“In the next few months, we must do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate pure athletes from the stainted system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Light Athletics Federations, will participate under a neutral flag in the World Championship on Light Athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Light Athletics Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements had yet to be met for Russia to recover.
As he reported to reporters in London following a report on the International Association of Athletics Federations Board, drug testing is still insufficient, and suspended coaches are still doing their job smoothly.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason.
The journalist Vasily Muravitzki, detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SSA), was arrested for two months and handed over to the SSA.
A member of the Žitomir Journal of the Internet is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against a journalist, considering it to be a “barbarbarian policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to undertake a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
A patrol ship, Commander Borsini, entered the territorial waters of Libya to stop the influx of illegal migrants, together with the Navy of that country.
The decision to launch the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which, however, does not control much of the country ' s territory.
The opposing Cabinet and the Libyan Parliament based in Tobrook accused Italy of violating Libyan sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they stated that they did not believe those threats and intended to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in negotiations between Italian Premier Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the recognized European Cabinet of the Libyan Government, Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities went to the establishment of a maritime mission to combat illegal migration, following the release in July of statistics on illegal arrivals from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.
Scalable failure occurred in Skype
A global failure in Skype's service was recorded today in several countries around the world.
On Thursday, 3 August, users began to send complaints to the program's developers.
Microsoft stressed that specialists were already actively working to address the problems faced by Europeans and North Americans, and explained the RIA News.
Let's remind you that Skype also suffered a malfunction in June of this year.
Users have been unable to receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of the Ukrainian team in light athletics were suspended from participating in the CM.
Olga Grounder and Olesia Povh, specializing in short distances, have been excluded from the Ukrainian team for the World Cup 2017 in London.
This is reported on the website of the National Federation of Light Athletics (FLAU).
This decision was taken by the organization in connection with the initiation by the International Association of Light Athletics Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings against light athletic women.
Trainer Sergey Basenko was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportsarena, IAAF suspects athletes in the use of doping.
Pokh is the bronze prize of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Cup, the 2010 European champion of the 4-100-metre relay, and the 2012 European champion of the 4-4-400-metre relay.
The London World Athletics Championship will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football will affect Naimar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent the world record transfer of Neimar from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris St. Germain.
Whatever consequences may follow along the chain, the UEFA’s governing body, which controls European football, has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious championship League tournament.
From the rules of the 2011 UEFA financial fair play, it is clear that the SGW will eventually have to show that Naymar's transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Naymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Naimar’s move to France.
SGW can definitely make a difference to hire Neumar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the rich energy of Qatar's ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums of money on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to reach the profitability threshold in their football business.
FFP introduced Michelle Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
A former French footballer believed that clubs that were in huge debt in their quest for success were essentially cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on the debts of the clubs and instead shifted to tracking their losses.
As a result, the change in the business model originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential and then to spend a lot of money to improve the team and create a world brand – became a difficult plan.
For the current three-year period, the 2018 valuations can cost 30 million euros.
And even though Platini was dishonorably removed from his presidency in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to contain excessive spending.
“FFP must be alive, and we will move forward and tighten the rules,” said Andrea Traverso to Associated Press last week, who controls the FFP in UEFA.
Even though SGW will pay the buyout of Neumar's contract on a one-time basis, he may be able to distribute this amount for reporting purposes throughout his contract.
Naymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in annual reporting as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were imposed on SWF, as well as on Abu Dhabi's Manchester City.
SGW was fined 60 million euros (at that rate of $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit its team to the League of Champions during the 2014–1015 season to 21 players instead of normal 25.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to outsmart its financial inspections by blowing up their profits from companies associated with the club's owners.
Although a Qatari company could have sponsored SGW, if the amount of funding had been considered to be above standard market rates, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of funding for SWF from the Qatar Tourism Authority had been increased.
It was reported that some of Naymar's earnings in the SGW could have been paid by the 2022 World Cup Organizing Committee in Qatar.
But SWF and Qatar-2022 deny that Naimar will be the ambassador of the World Cup, and such a manoeuvre could easily be discovered by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on SVU mean that UEFA will be more closely monitoring any attempts to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, people familiar with the situation reported that UEFA did not engage in preliminary discussions with SVU about the Naimar transfer.
They spoke to Associated Press on an anonymous basis because they were not authorised to discuss the situation of SWP.
According to the latest published report, SGW earned more than 10 million euros in the period 2015-1016 with a turnover of €542.4 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have not yet been published.
SGW expects that the arrival of Naimar will provide a good basis for sponsorships, the sale of attributes, and T-shirts with the team logo.
At the club, it is assumed that turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent as a result of the recruitment of a new player.
Undoubtedly angry at the departure of one of the best footballers, the Spanish league tried to prevent the transfer of Naymar, claiming that “SWU” would violate the financial fair play.
“This is an obvious case of `financial doping', with the club and with the state,” said the Spanish newspaper AS, President La League Javier Tebas, referring to Qatar as the ultimate owner of the SVU.
Arsenal coach Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports magnate, shares La League's doubts about government funding for the club.
“It's all the consequences of equity participation, and it's completely changed the landscape of football over the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It's getting very difficult to keep a financial fair play because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The President will decide the order and place of the oath.
Where and as new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation, the President will decide - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law have drawn up the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Construction.
A week ago, the deputies planned to make a direct determination of the procedure for swearing in the law.
Children under the age of 18 will be released from the solemn oath, as well as those who are incapacitated, as follows from the amended text of the amendments to the draft law “On citizenship of the Russian Federation” (available in the possession of “Izvedi”), which the committee will consider before its second reading on 11 July.
On 6 June, President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of swearing an oath to become a Russian citizen instead of formally signing documents during a meeting with the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies drafted this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill to repeal the decision to extradite nationality to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist offences: for example, for public incitement to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (art. 205.2, para. 2, of the Criminal Code), as well as for the hijacking of a plane, train or water transport, but only if the act is linked to terrorism (art. 211, para. 4, of the Criminal Code).
According to the bill, his logic was as follows: by issuing citizenship documents, a person is bound by a promise to comply with Russian legislation - by taking the path of extremism, he is violating that promise.
In April, the Government was introduced by the leaders of the Douma factions, Vladimir Vasiliev (United Russia), Gennady Zyuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov (Just Russia) and the Speaker of DD Viacheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the deputies adopted it on first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but it has now been redrafted.
It now states that the President of the Russian Federation will set the order of the oath.
Parliamentarians had previously intended to describe the procedure directly in the Russian Nationality Act, stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting in front of the State emblem and the Russian flag in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event was to take place - a list of places where a Russian flag could be located was regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, cabinets of heads of State of entities, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive authorities, etc.
It's likely that it could also be the registry.
A solemn oath will be given to those who wish to acquire Russian nationality once their documents have been checked by the officials.
But the Russian passport will only be obtained after the oath comes from the finalized text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn in at the age of 18, not at the age of 14.
The rule that incompetent or limited persons, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or sign the text of the oath, will be waived from swearing in.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to release from this procedure and “other persons”,
The updated bill also sets out a special procedure for the admission of Ukrainian citizens who are considered to be Russian speakers.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting an application to the authorized body of Ukraine for that purpose.
A notarized copy of the statement would have to be handed over to Russian officials.
Rejection of “alien” nationality, as it is now, will not be required if this is provided for by an international treaty or if this is not possible “for reasons beyond the control of the person”.
An amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the First Vice-Speaker of the DG Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Kovlinskaya, Pavel Krascheninnikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all “One Russia”).
I think many of you know it's impossible to get a certificate from Ukraine, it's impossible.
Accordingly, there are many people waiting to decide their fate with regard to Russian citizenship, explained the previous day by the head of the Dumesian Committee on State and Law, Pavel Krascheninnikov (ER).
In addition, it has been clarified in the text that restrictions on the employment of certain foreign posts would not apply to those who have given up their “other” citizenship in writing and handed over their previous passport to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, but “for reasons beyond their control” have not ceased to be considered nationals of another country.
It is now prohibited for foreigners to hold positions in the municipal service, to be employed in facilities and organizations whose activities are related to Russia ' s security.
Also, a person with dual nationality or a residence permit of another country may not become a member of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
The law is scheduled to enter into force on 1 September 2017 and the necessary by-laws are expected to be in place by that time.
Nostalgia becomes niche in "The Hot American Fly" and "Detective Companion"
The current iteration of history nostalgically recalls the glorious days of the characters in the '80s; the era of the grunge in the '90s (sometimes at a time when outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Schovalter made a comedy of sketches for MTV); and themselves, that is, themselves, before its stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poler and Paul Rudd, went to more serious things.
As a cultural fact, it is both the elevation and the embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems anachronistic.
"The First Day of the Camp" was surprisingly good, and not just because of absurd humor (including the original story of the talking can of vegetables that H. John Benjamin spoke).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have just reached the age of majority; thus, the inability to return to the joke becomes part of the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults have already played adults, have less profound emotional roots, and its parody is more unsystemic and includes riffs from steel films of the '90s like "Cradle Rocking Hands."
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheel roller skates, and "a bunch of other things from 1991".
A lot of story moves are the same.
Good-hearted Coop (Showalter), now a writer, still has not achieved reciprocity from Cathy (Marguerite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) still has his virginity.
And there's this crazy and mean conspiracy that Ronald Reagan (also Shawalter) is involved in, which George W. Bush Sr. is now instigating.
As always, the best part of the franchise is retreating from it.
It's particularly fun to see a young Rudd sing a song by Matt Dillon from One, whose character, Andy's old man, looks like an old man now.
The success of this franchise could be random madness in the spirit of a recursive series called Seven Up, until it reaches what I think would be its logical conclusion: "The Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where in the last scene the entire company would go to the film premiere of "The Hot American Summer".
"Detective Companion" in the Amazon addresses another type of nostalgia: the memory of the American Cold War, the "Blond Explorer" or even the "Glasska" with her images of the East-West struggle.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Reese Thomas, depicts a television film: a Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The main roles of Gregor and the idealist Joseph are played by Florin Pierresik, Jr., and Cornelio Ulić, and their dialogues in English in Channing Tatum (also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are some visual jokes (police officers spend time watching a chess game, how Americans could watch football).
The band of famous voices behind the scenes, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahersala Ali and Chloe Sevigny, makes it interesting to play "think the voice."
But "Comrade Detective" is holding on to the plausible clumsy propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask -- which often looks like her.
Six long episodes are long, and it's not funny and it's not often.
If it were shortened, the Companion Detective could better deal with his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American embassy, there are two fat people sitting in the lobby eating a bunch of hamburgers.
An imaginary communist viewer, this image says that Western culture is capable of obesity from anything.
The fictional Romanian writers of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The prize fund for the Russian Super Bowl football game between Spartacus and Locomotive will be about 30 million roubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (FFL), Sergey Prukin, at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, RT reports.
He also added that, to date, there were almost no tickets left for the match.
The Spartacus-Locomotive match will take place on Friday, 14 July, 9:30.
According to TASS, Spartacus is an active champion of the Russian Federation and Locomotive is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young Ufimen cleaned the furniture room for 200,000 rubles.
The other day, a 37-year-old Ufiman with a furniture firm approached the police.
The man claimed to have stolen expensive tools from the workshop, causing serious damage to his production.
The miners were tools worth almost 200,000 rubles — two welding machines, perforator, hydraulics, and a winch.
The guards of the police began to search for criminals and soon came to the inhabitants of Bashcortostan, 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, the accomplices entered the company's territory, broke into the front door and removed the tools.
Right after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first car service they found.
A case of theft had already been brought against them, and the law enforcement officers had managed to return only some of the stolen instruments to the rightful owner.
State Department commented on Medvedev's comments on the relations between the Russian Federation and the United States
The US and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State Department, Heather Nauert, in response to Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev ' s two-State statement.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government stated that, by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the US had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared the Russian Federation a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations were “lower”, but noted that there was a need to look for “areas of interaction”.
"Look at the truce in the southwest of Syria, which has been in effect for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the US and Russia," quotes the diplomat RIA News.
At the same time, a representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the Russian premier ' s statement that sanctions amounted to a trade war.
The new sanctions bill against Russia, Iran and the DPRK was signed by US President Donald Trump last Wednesday.
In doing so, he acknowledged that the document had failed and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "created" roses from amethysts and quartz.
The jewellery unit of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - added to Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They had five new rings and three rings on velvet tapes.
In the Rose Dior Pré Catelan line, two new rings and necklaces of amethysts, pink quartz and diamonds were produced in glyptics (man-handed stone cutting) and pasta, marking the 70th anniversary of the home.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoire de Castellan was inspired by the roses he cultivated at his estate in Granville by modeler Christian Dior, and by the gardens of Bagathel and Pre-Catelan in Paris.
Trump found the perpetrators of the deterioration of relations with Russia.
President Donald Trump of the United States criticized Congressional members.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relationship with Russia is at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," wrote the president on Twitter.
On the eve of the day, Donald Trump signed the new sanctions law against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
These will affect Russian banks and energy companies in particular.
The White House subsequently issued a presidential statement in which he indicated that the law would not allow the US to enter into lucrative deals and would bring the Russian Federation, China, and North Korea closer together.
A Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank.
A businessman from Belarus, Victor Prokopenja, withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained to RBC his intention to “concentrate on our other planned investments and projects that we are working on”.
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a move would be a "best investment of time" despite the investment attraction of buying Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main bidder for a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the consortium NorvikBank Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Guceriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Peter Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One such financial organization, in addition to the TSA and the Vneshconombank, became Sberbank.
Novak gave the reason for the blackout in Crimea.
In the Ministry of Energy, the Russian Federation has identified the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
Alexander Novak, the head of the department, explained what had happened.
According to him, the peninsula was powerless due to an accident in Krasnodar territory.
The truck involved in the accident hit the transmission lines, resulting in the disconnection of Cuban and related Crimea networks.
Electricity failures in large Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The specialists corrected the malfunction within a few hours.
Initially it was reported that blackout could have been caused by an abnormal heat.
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 per cent
It is expected that the Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and declining inflation have caused rumours of possible increases to subside.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain slow and left interest rates unchanged among the growing pressures on family income.
The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with a result of 6 to 2 for keeping the rate at 0.25 per cent, with fewer members in favour of an increase this month because weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its projections to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018, and warned that pressure on family income would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in the fall.
However, the bank warned that increases in rates in the next few years would be necessary to control breczite-induced inflation, and stated that it was likely that borrowing costs would have to be raised more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to abandon part of the enormous economic development package launched a year ago as a result of breczyte.
Starting next February, the bank will close the emergency financing plan for which it provides banks with cheap loans, although it has announced that it now has to provide an additional 15 billion pounds, up to 115 billion pounds, under the plan.
In the rate decision protocol, the bank said: “According to the MPC’s main projections, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) remains slow in the near future, while pressures on real household income continue to affect consumption.”
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that a “severe tightening of financial policies” at a “severely larger” level than expected by markets would be necessary to halt inflation.
At this point, markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all promotions would be “phased” and “limited”.
The bank's projections for growth in this year and the following year are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9% and 1.7%.
The Bank has kept its projections constant by 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After that news, the sterling fell relative to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and by 0.4 per cent to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was taken after recent discouraging growth rates weakened the increased expectation of growth; GDP then increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank’s latest report on inflation gave little reason to rejoice at households that were hit by high inflation and very little wage increases: the bank said that pressure would increase before they fell.
The Bank added that financial policies “can’t prevent” audao from earning in the next few years, but expects that wages will be “significantly” restored by the end of its three - year forecast.
The economy is also determined to grow as a result of the growing demand for British goods, which is due to the low rate of the pound, which offsets part of the lower consumer spending.
The decision was taken a year after last August’s reduction to 0.25 per cent after the shocking results of the EU withdrawal referendum, which led to the fall of the pound.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last decision on rates, there was an increase in noise around the anticipated increase in rates, as inflation was increasing pressure on already under pressure households: three committee specialists asked to raise the rate to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that the decline was expected and re-compensated in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher rate than the 2 per cent planned was entirely due to the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Mortgage Brokers Coreco, said: “In view of the recent fall in Swap rates, it seems that the mortgage market will again become even more competitive, as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good end of the year.
The market seems particularly favourable to those who are approaching the end of their existing treaties, as refinancing of credit, often with the possibility of a lack of commission, and with low stakes, becomes more popular than ever.”
Public Health Service will prescribe a controversial HIV drug for 10,000 people
Beginning in September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” HIV prevention drug after a battle in the High Court for funding the drug from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that pre-exposure HIV prevention (PREP), a pre-sex pill that was proven to reduce the risk of infection in persons at risk by an average of 86 per cent, would now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year trial period by approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to finance the test after the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court decision last year, which claimed that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay for the PPE, despite her claims that it should be financed by the local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was described as “the most important innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it “the turning point.”
Prior to the full launch of the program throughout England, by April 2018, venereal dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, and more dispensaries will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PREP) is a pre-sex course for HIV drugs to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Research has shown that PEI significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When you take PEI before you have sex, there's enough of certain drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or not later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for medication include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispatchers will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender persons and persons whose partners are unknown whether their HIV status is contained by antiretroviral therapy.
People who live and are assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest sexually transmitted diseases clinic in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England has signed a drug contract this week after an international tender for purchase.
The study is designed to assess the full potential of PEI by collecting clinical data on who the target audience of the drug is, on its absorption and on a large scale.
“This critical innovation should complement and strengthen the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National AIDS Control Authority), stated: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
The PEI, if properly targeted at people in need and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the state of the HIV epidemic in England.
Beginning in September, people at risk for HIV, thanks to a study carried out in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new opportunity tool that can be controlled by a person without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many or many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Jan Greene, president of Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “The first thing to do now is to make sure that the test is quickly rolled around the country and that no one at risk is forgotten about HIV.
Now that we've been provided with an experimental PPE drug, we're going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.”
The Shadow Minister of Public Health, Sharon Hodgson, said: “We very much welcome the beginning of the PEO test, which was very late because of months of delay and delay on the part of the government.”
The data show how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PEI.
Now it is important that the test be deployed as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect those at risk of HIV and to move us one step further towards halting the spread of HIV in society.
World Tatar Congress adopted a resolution supporting the Tatarstan and Russian treaties
The Sixth Congress of the World Tatar Congress (WCC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the office of President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a positive form of organization of the highest State authority in the Republic, expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people”.
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, “he played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
We recall that the Moscow-Kazanu treaty was concluded for a period of 10 years since 24 July 2007.
On 11 July, the deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and to retain the title of the seat of head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only member of the Federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one who's called the president.
In Russia, difficulties arose in obtaining international driving permits
HICD units suffer from a shortage of international driving permits (IDPs).
In order to obtain such rights, it takes weeks to wait, which has become a real problem for vacationers wishing to travel abroad with their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with regard to international driving permits remains contradictory.
IDP was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written on the national certificate, as it was explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights were set out in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights were recognized in countries that had ratified the Vienna Convention.
In reality, however, it depends on a specific police or rental office: some require an IDP and some have sufficient national rights.
In order to provide security, drivers of international law do receive, but it is worth bearing in mind that in non-ratification countries (e.g. the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or IDPs.
There is now a problem with the forms in almost all HIELD units, reports Commersant, after conducting a study in a number of regions.
For example, in Moscow, the IGBD units have simply not issued tickets, and the forms have been missing for four months.
You can make an appointment on the public service website, but it's already been waiting for mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, IDPs cannot be obtained “for technical reasons” without entering into the details, and in the Samara region, they honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation is taking place in other cities.
Many Moscows have already faced a problem, and social media reports are becoming more frequent:
Irina Burmitrova: "Wait, why can't we get international rights in Moscow?"
That's right, 'cause all of the H.I.E.D. offices ran out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A question to people who know!"
We need to get international rights very urgently.
In Moscow, it's always far ahead, and they don't give out a ticket at all (but they can't give a ticket).
It seems like a public service portal shows that Spb's is free to shit.
Did anyone try to get in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for international driving permits have changed, so new forms are being delivered to the State Inspectorate units.
This may be the case, but it is not clear what changes are involved, and this has not been previously reported.
The forms purchase the Special Road Safety Centre (SSC) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then deliver them to the HIELD units.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with the Goznák AO: almost 200,000 IDP forms were manufactured in 2014 - 2015, 15,000 forms were purchased in 2016, 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract was concluded on 18 July with the First Printing Court SLA for the production of 70,000 forms.
There's a theory that the NPR just didn't make it in time for the tender, which caused the deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people did not travel to Europe on their own, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand, and so on.
What rights are accepted there is not entirely clear, so people are re-insuranced, and so there has been a huge demand for international crusts.
It has recently been reported that professional drivers will have to pass an examination to prove their qualifications.
Mintrans made this suggestion.
The new International Driving Permit (IDP) has been in force since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Pavel Petrenko, stated that he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
That's what he said on Friday, August 4, in an interview with the Observer portal.
No self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or a bolt in it because it risks losing its business in the EU, the US, and Japan – countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia against Crimea.
“I am deeply convinced that there is virtually no prospect of this project”, said Petrenko.
He added that Russia considered that it was unable to implement a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build smaller objects.
I know that since the Sochi Olympics, whole stadiums have begun to collapse.
“So I believe that the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that have proved to be short-sighted enough to join the project”, the official noted.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of the car arch of the Crimean Bridge.
On the Kerchen shore, a large-scale assembly of the Crimean Bridge road arch has been completed: it is closed at a height of 45 metres from the base of the structure.
“One time the bridge builders have prepared a rail arch on the fairway supports”, reported at the project information centre.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport, Maxim Sokolov, informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the site was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Province.
In Spain, an official who had not been to work for 10 years was fired.
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the head of Spanish official Carlos Recio have?
The permanent hike lasted 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was dismissed.
But not by his direct boss.
Things that don't happen in the bureaucrat world.
They seem to be getting used to all the "people's service" stuff.
Yet, officials are always able to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time the "sensation" came from Spain.
There, an archivist named Valencia Carles Resio managed to stay away from work for ten years.
He received regular salaries.
And it's worth 50,000 euros a year.
And then Mr. Recio's "screw times" ended.
He was fired by the Valencia Legislative Assembly.
In the investigation, it turns out that a violent walker came to the office every working morning at 07:00 to report to the electronics system.
And then he went home.
Once again, he showed up at 4:00 p.m. to report back to the system that he had left.
It's been ten years.
It was also reported that all his free time was spent drawing comic books at home.
The members of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia are now thinking about how to punish Mr. Recio's direct superior, who could not but know how to “actually work” in his workplace.
Judges Offer protection from Presidents
On behalf of Vladimir Putin, the Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC) has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes that the powers of the presidents of the courts be limited and that they be elected.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the HRC wishes to introduce special districts that will not be linked to territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court is also required to submit its presidential proposals.
The HRC has finalized proposals that will enhance the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by HRC on behalf of Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with the Council.
The meeting with the Council on 8 December 2016 discussed, inter alia, individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see OS of 9 December).
The work of the HRC has resulted in 25 proposals, covering both the independence of the judiciary and the identification of miscarriage of justice, as well as the financing of the courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Kremlin human rights defenders was to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts in order to enhance the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate for the post of judge had successfully passed the competition and had received the support of the judicial community, the President of the Court, in the opinion of the Human Rights Council, should submit him for appointment without the right to refuse, as currently permitted by law.
It is also proposed that the President should not be allowed to assign cases to judges.
Doing it, experts admit, maybe a specially written computer program.
The HRC also considers that the President is not entitled to “predetermine the results of the judge's qualification, initiate disciplinary action, or decide on the imposition of additional material payments”.
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to the “election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves” and to “entitle them to a relatively short term with mandatory rotation”.
All presidents of the courts (from republic to district) are now appointed by the President for a period of six years on the proposal of the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the HRC proposes to re-organize the appeal and cassation before the courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to administrative territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC states that “there is a need to ensure that individual courts of appeal and cassation are organized not at the level of the regional courts in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts”.
The experts are guided by the practice of arbitral tribunals.
They have “judicial districts” which do not coincide with administrative division in the Russian Federation, but which thus guarantee greater independence from regional officials who find it difficult to use “telephone law”.
The HRC peace judges propose to be strengthened by people's jurors to deal with certain “civil and administrative categories” with them.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, reinstatement at work, protection of honour and dignity, denial of driving rights, etc.
"These are only our proposals," explained HRC member, retired Constitutional Court judge Tamara Morsjakov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate concerned not only the HRC but also the Supreme Court, which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time to carry out the task (including the Office of the Attorney-General and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation).
To inform Vladimir Putin of the effectiveness of the independence of justice in the Russian Federation, President Vyacheslav Lebedev is scheduled to do so by 1 September.
To live a high life: half floors and clever designs turned this little apartment into a spacious home in Earls Court.
Joan Lee, a former banker interested in real estate repairs, moved from a large house in Nightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the ground floor of a pretty model home like Queen Anne, and in favor of the new design, it says that Joan didn't pack her things and move again.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger area," Joan says.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
They showed me this apartment at Earls Court, and there were also high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered her a price on the same day."
Since the first look, an apartment of 1,000 square feet has been refurbished.
Originally, it was an apartment with one bedroom of complex planning – to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage spaces and half floors to extract maximum benefit from the generous height of the ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my demand," she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill architectural design studio "Duck & Shed" to use ceilings of 12.5 feet high and to build a home that would not only be a successful project but would be for Joan to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two spaces above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-storey where you could stand at full height.
Erfan had to think creatively to handle the breeze.
“Working with steel structures is very difficult”, he explains.
“We had to place the premises so that they were one over the other, and we didn't have to bend.
We didn't just have to build a simple platform, but we had to bend the design so that it could be at the right height and allow the spaces to be used from the top and bottom.”
This decision allowed Erfan to set up two full-sized rooms one above the other in the space reserved, and a lot more interesting.
From the semi-deck through the vintage copper light window, the Retrouvius opens a view of the luxurious living room below.
Mirror furniture with gold finishes, silver accents, and vintage lighting from Serge Muy set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding sight, space, and light.
The short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a mirror protection panel seems like a window to another room.
At the entrance, the mirror closets are used to store all of Joan’s dishes.
To create a sense of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can block the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new about the folding kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's a moving door up like in the garage.
“The engineering was involved here,” Erfan tells us about the reinforced steel wood-fibrous shield door.
“It is equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slips very easily.”
Thanks to the reasonable use of storage space and facilities, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom, and improved planning.
“In the end, the floor area is exactly what you're going to sell, that is, what your real estate is worth,” Erfan says.
“Surely speaking, a real estate agent will come in and make calculations based on the floor area.”
Here they have been able to increase the floor area by using quality materials that give a shade of luxurious space.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection to home,” Erfan says.
“No one falls in love with electrical wiring in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't touch the strings of our hearts.”
This shows that with good design and an enlarged metre, an apartment can turn from something normal into something amazing.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of the Cultural Policy Commission
The Russian Government has approved the establishment of a commission on State cultural policy.
The decree is published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to cultural policy.
The Commission will also draft cultural policy strategies, clarify objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation has been appointed Head of the Commission.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, approved a plan to implement the State Cultural Policy Strategy until 2030 in 2016.
The plan includes 193 activities and provides for measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries and to preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries decreased to a minimum of eight years
Consumer price increases in G20 countries have fallen to the minimum values in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
OECD estimates that inflation in June 2016 was 2 per cent - lower in October 2009, when the price index was 1.7 per cent.
Rossstat previously reported a drop of 0.1 per cent in the Russian consumer price index.
The agency thus recorded the first week of deflation in 2017.
Inflation in Russia is calculated by the Ministry of Finance at 4.1 per cent.
The Ministry of Economics, however, believes that the target has already been reached - according to this agency, the figure is 4 per cent.
Putin warned against the illegal logging of the Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against the illegal destruction of forests during a meeting on environmental development in the natural Baikal territory.
In the course of the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergey Donskaya, noted that a bill had previously been drafted.
It allows logging during fire clearance, and the government is planning to take it in the fall.
The President, for his part, said that the project should be kept under review so that “everything will not be knocked out”.
Donski noted that the draft law involved monitoring by the MES and the supervisory authorities.
Media: VSU fighters secretly negotiate with Donbass militia
A regular telephone service has been established in the area of the armed confrontation in Donbasa.
Fighters of the warring parties communicate with each other on mobile phones all the time, and they don't know about this at headquarters.
The FSU and the Donbassa militia have established communications via cell phones secretly from their high command.
This is reported by Strana.ua on 4 August with reference to the military operation in Donbassa.
According to the publication, unit commanders are well aware of the names of their counterparts on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by telephone.
Communication is not domestic: commanders are trying to reach some “tactical arrangements”.
Frequently, such conversations result in a truce on a certain part of the front.
Journalists learned of cases in which an officer had received his birthday congratulations from his official enemy because of the front line.
WSW and NPD and LPD militia have been sitting in trenches on the boundary line since spring 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against Donbass.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is outraged by the blocking of U.N.S. statements about attacks on the Embassy of the Russian Federation.
The Russian foreign policy department is outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives, who block the statements of the United Nations in the press condemning the terrorist bombings of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
It was recalled that the Russian Embassy in Damascus had been subjected, for the third time in a month, to mortar attacks by Hiat Tahrir Al-Sham (former Jabhat al-Nusra, prohibited in the Russian Federation) and Falak Al-Rahman.
Taking into account that the international community is united in the designation of Nusra as a terrorist organization and the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council call for opposition to this structure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation stated that “it would be clear that the Nusra attacks should be universally condemned unconditionally and strongly and that there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions”.
However, as stressed by the Department, “for the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine on the United Nations Security Council, alternating the tone of objections, concealing the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the Russian Federation's proposal to adopt a standard short draft Security Council press statement condemning terrorist attacks on Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital”.
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain with those delegations.
“The most disturbing thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn terrorist acts encourages them to engage in further provocations and terrorist attacks, gives them a sense of impunity,” stated the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and added that “it would not be desirable for these barbarians to be convinced that there is someone in the Security Council who is with them”.
Vladimir Putin advocated limiting the number of unscheduled business inspections
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated during the meeting on investment projects in the Far East that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30 per cent of the number of scheduled inspections, and that the duration of inspections should be limited to ten days.
“Unscheduled inspections shall normally be carried out without appropriate agreement with the Public Prosecutor's Office; only 2-3 per cent shall be agreed with the Public Prosecutor's Office, and the rest shall proceed independently”, quotes the President of TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited from confiscating servers and hard drives in businesses.
In addition, the President believes that business associations should have the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
“It is hoped that it will make some positive progress in dealing with business-related cases or infringing the law in the area of business”, said the Head of State.
According to OS, other types of business inspections are increasing due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections.
In May, a survey was commissioned by a business ombudsman under the President of Russia, Boris Titov, which revealed that there had actually been a substitution of routine checks by unplanned means (from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), by prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), by raids (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), by citizens (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and by administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).

Brothers are fighting for a real estate empire worth over $500 million.
Two brothers fight for one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million – 40 years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colin de Lutis live at the Torak Palace three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a claim against him in the Supreme Court for the division of possessions and assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still in a violent dispute about the terms of divorce.
Together with their mother, Anna's brothers own 87 facilities worth more than half a billion dollars purchased since their family bought a shop on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew up in a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family's property list today includes office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Golden Coast and Mount Bueller and suburb shopping centres.
By agreement with the late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as the “primary driving force and dominant person” of the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's property is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the Supreme Court heard its first hearing.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - from which Paul thinks Colin expelled him.
Colin claims this is not the case, but he accuses Paul of incompetent management of certain objects.
In Colin's testimony at the beginning of the trial, he says he's looking forward to resolving the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me think of the family as the top priority," he wrote.
The court costs are rising as a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Kramer have been added; both parties have engaged the most prominent lawyers, including Royal Advocate Allan Meyers, and the best cooks.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late wife, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they have run dairy bars and malls, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a shop in Collingwood where Colin opened his first family jeans store.
Colin says he launched Westco when he was "in the last grade of school, and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, were hoping to hand over their property to their sons without conflict.
"Louigi used to tell me he didn't want the brothers to judge in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lucis' group; Colina says Mark got 10 million when he left business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the financial terms of their division."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of AFL's board of directors and, according to his 2015 biography, Eddie McGuire was the best friend of a TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded with a text message saying that since the case had not yet been tried, "I really have nothing to say."
"I'm very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and talk to the court about our family's name," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin testified that he was trying to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our father would not like to see Paul and I arguing in court," he said, adding that "still hopes for a solution to the conflict."
On Friday, that hope must have dissipated.
"The judgment in our case will soon be rendered by the court," wrote Colin.
The new Chief of Staff of Trump is planning to limit the information to the President.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do that.
In that case, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports from the media, hoping to keep the chief calmer.
That's what reporter Josh Dozee says.
"At a meeting held by the new Chief of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, with the management of the staff on his first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House of President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: bad channels of information to the President."
Kelly told the staff that the information had to go through it -- paper or briefing -- because the president would be better off making decisions if he received the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is absolutely correct, but others have already failed in trying to keep Trump at bay by tracking the information received.
President Trump's relationship with television developed decades ago -- and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, resented the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he received fair coverage in publications that could be reconvinced," said "Politico" in February by Sam Nanberg, a former electoral counselor.
Tara Palmeri wrote to Politico at the time that "the six former members of the electoral staff said that in order to control Trump's habit of tweeting, they had to make sure that his personal information contained a constant stream of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's habit of tweeting was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these election staff members know something that we don't know -- for example, that if it weren't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets Trump didn't publish.
If his staff had saved him from trouble at least a few times, their efforts had not been in vain.
But no one has always managed to keep Trump from putting oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by supplying Trump with material, reliable or not, which confirms their views.
Politico, which is exactly what this story is about, wrote in May about the tendency of the councillors to constantly give the president questionable information.
Here's an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Trump's current and former staff say that Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks of information, and will not rest until he finds out who was behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone gave the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, in which Deputy Chief of Staff Cathy Welsh was accused of standing behind the leaks in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is forever tampered with on Twitter for his aggressive behavior, that he didn't present specific facts, or that in the past he launched false accusations and then turned them down.
Trump read the article and started asking the staff about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that the then Chief of Staff Raines Pribus and the Secretary of Staff Rob Porter "were trying to build a system to control and document the flow of papers that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same.
He may be a more efficient manager than Pribus, but Trump is still impulsive, and his assistants are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
The Tumen Prosecutor's Office is fighting the HIV dissident
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the ruling of the Kalininsky Ryuda Tumeni, who had dropped the criminal case against a local woman who had died of HIV as a result of a minor daughter.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother was a HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court relieved her of responsibility for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished without setting a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a Tumeni resident was initiated under article 109, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (death due to negligence) in April, following the death of her three-year-old daughter from HIV infection.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
“The woman was not treated herself and refused to treat her daughter in the belief that there was no HIV infection”, explained the Tumen district prosecutor's office.
The criminal case came to the Kalininsky Rye Court of Tumeni, which decided on 25 July to discontinue it.
The father of the deceased girl pleaded, explaining that “he has forgiven his wife, has no claim against her, has made amends and has apologized”.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office disagreed with the court ' s decision and filed an appeal, demanding that the dismissal order be revoked and that it be referred to a new hearing.
The girl died, and there's no way to make amends for the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of the doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her against a dangerous infection”, reported the Public Prosecutor's Office.
According to the oversight body, she should be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents would follow her example.
According to the Tumen AIDS Center, there are now about 12 children living with HIV in Tumen province who do not receive treatment because of parental failure.
"And this situation has already improved -- in the year of the work of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV changed their minds -- they let them diagnose them, they started taking medications," said Elena Loseva, a press secretary at the AIDS Center.
According to her, it was not possible to influence parents in a legislative manner, and as a result not all HIV-positive children were found, mothers were not allowed to examine them, were hiding and were running away with children from hospitals.
The risks of HIV dissidents
At the end of last year, Petroburg's sociologists presented the results of Russia's first study of the so-called HIV dissident movement.
HIV dissidents are called people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Health professionals and activists in AIDS service NCBs call such views anti-medical, and their spread is seen as a serious threat.
A terrible photo session, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the Greek railway station in Khmelnitsk.
A cheerful company of drunk young people walked over the railroads, where a freight train was standing.
One friend had the idea of making an imaginary selfie on the roof of the wagon, told FACTAM in the police communications sector in Khmelnitsk oblast.
The guy started coming down from the bridge to the train, but because of his indiscretion, he clinged to the power line and immediately got electrocuted.
Fortunately, this incident was reported to the station controller, who immediately called an ambulance.
Prior to the arrival of the victim, the doctor was transferred to a safe place and then hospitalized in the burn section of the Khmelnitsk District Clinical Hospital.
The men were diagnosed with body burns of 1-2 degrees.
His condition is now assessed as stable.
Law enforcement officials recall that recently extreme selfies on rooftops, bridges, and transport have become increasingly popular.
The police call on people to be vigilant and to prevent such photo shoots, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists allowed the oceans to exist on ancient Venus
There could be oceans on the ancient Venus.
That was the assumption made by French scientists.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the formation of water on the surface of the planets, writing Science News.
It turns out that in Venus, at the beginning of its history, there were oceans with 10% more water than it is now on Earth.
Previously, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that, according to the scientific hypothesis, the ocean could have existed on Mars four billion years ago.
Foreign experts concluded in their research that the water facility was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured in a park in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were shot and transferred to the Associated Press.
The incident took place in Dolores Park, where a significant number of visitors were present.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them grabbed a gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the intruders could not be seen, since they had all but their eyes closed.
Another medical treatment was provided, after which he was released.
The third wounded is a minor, no details of his condition.
The Dolores Park Hill is a popular place for local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured while shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured trying to leave the premises.
Luna's rock band will present a new album at Barnaul.
The Louna rock band concert will be held in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album, "The Wild New World", which is one of the most expected releases of the year.
The team is preparing a concept show that will be the brightest in the band's concert history.
"The Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Luna.
Its name is related to the famous novel antiotopia of O. Huxley's "O Wonderful New World."
New songs don't rehearse the book, they talk about a society that lives by the law of anti-Utopia, "blind by the faith of propaganda and imposed values."
The band was helped to collect money for recording the album: on the Planet.ru website, the project was supported by more than 1,200 people.
Her first album, "Make Louder!", was released in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the record "Time X", and in 2013 they recorded the album "We are Luna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, Luna performed a symphony orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the "Peace Songs" program.
Lusine Gevorkian (vocal), Vitaly Demidenko (bas-gitara), Ruben Kazarian (gitara), Sergey Poncratev (gitara), Leonid Kinsburski (drabana).
The concert will take place at the Barnaul Club, Faraon, on October 17, at 7:00.
The price of tickets is between 1,200 and 2,600 rubles.
Luna is one of the required groups on the Russian rock scene.
The collection was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The band won a number of different hit-parade nominations to the Black Duty.
The gypsies overcame the trench and returned to the "millionaire street"
Some of the richest landlords in West Midland are again in conflict with the strong Roma who have overcame the moats that have been dug by the municipal authorities in order to re-enter the field near their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihalla street, which received the funny name "Millionaire Street".
With horses, infants, and lots of wheelhouses, they returned after being kicked out no more than in May, and were not prevented by the moats dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactful company found a break in the defense structures and shredded its vehicles through a section that left unsolved to leave space for the path.
The angry residents attacked the city of Solihallah, saying that it was “unable to solve the problem.”
An anonymous local woman said, "They came here Monday night after they were driven out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by."
The municipality should be shamed and forced to act because it is completely incapable of solving the problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they were banished, and they came back again.
More gypsies arrived last night, and maybe even more today.
“The municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like that I keep paying municipal tax, and the municipality can't even stop it.”
One local resident who wanted to stay anonymous said, "This is ridiculous, we just saw these gypsies leave the previous time, and here, please, this attack continues."
This time there were more, and we even saw a horse climbing on the meadow.”
A representative of the municipality of Solihallah stated: “We know about an illegal camp on land near Streetsbrook Road and are cooperating with the Solihal police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them away as soon as possible.”
To help us gather evidence, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police on the phone 101.
This gives us an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares the New World Champagne Wine Plant.
The PCO of the Republic of Crimea, the “New World Champagne Vine Plant”, has decided to take action by transforming the “New World Champagne Plant” into the OAO, following an order from the Minister of Property and Land Relations, Crimea Anna Anuhina.
100 per cent of the company's shares will remain in Crimea's public domain.
The equity company will have a fixed capital of 595.5 million roubles and will consist of 5.955 million shares of common stock with a nominal value of 100 roubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Crimea, stated that if funds were not found for upgrading the plant in the next three years, the plant would be at risk of shutting down.
The production of basic funds in the enterprise is between 60 and 70 per cent.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion roubles. Because of its institutional and legal nature, it is obliged to pay 50 per cent of the income to the budget.
What remains is not sufficient to implement the modernization plan.
"It is difficult to get money from the owner, to talk about borrowing large credit organizations," said Sergey Petelin's head of the Crimea Minselhoza in April this year.
The Crimea Parliament included the enterprise in the privatization projection plan for 2017.
It was suggested that he should be stocked and tendered.
Interfax's source in Crimea government estimated the possible value of selling the business at $40 million, investor investment in modernization at $30 million.
The New World increased the production of playing wine by 2.8 per cent in 2016, compared to the 2015 level, to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New World intended to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lion Golitsyn as a gambling wine factory in the New World estate he acquired.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Suburban third graders destroyed more than 40 gravestones
Members of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the district of Nizhgorod have identified the citizens who have destroyed 46 gravestones in the cemetery of the town of Lyskovo.
Intruders turned out to be third-class students.
The first claim that the gravestones were damaged by unknowns was received by the Russian DMVD in the Lyskovsk region as early as 27 June.
A total of 24 people contacted the police in this regard.
As a result, criminal proceedings were instituted under article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, “Destroying, damaging or desecration of burial sites”.
As a result of the investigation, the police identified suspects, who were two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing monuments fall, and that prompted them to commit hooliganism.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone with regard to NGO ships that rescue migrants.
Italy warned NGOs owned by rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue unless they complied with the new rules governing their activities.
“If NGOs fail to comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to tell whether they will be able to continue their activities”, said Home Secretary Mario Minniti in an interview with the Turkish daily Stampa.
The warning was given by Minnichi the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rette on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has worked for only a year, has declined to comment on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Kartozio.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue to operate in the search and rescue zone," states the organization's statement on social media.
"We will only be able to assess all the charges now, after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been following the Juventa ship belonging to Jugend Retette since October.
His crew is suspected of having taken migrants on board by lifeboats, who were sent directly to them by traffickers, and allowing smugglers to leave with boats they could use again.
At least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as stated in the prosecution file, the content of which was published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the orders of the Italian coastal authorities, which control rescue operations in the area, more on humanitarian grounds than on any other grounds.
The Code of Conduct presupposes, mainly, that the “Juventa” type of vessels will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue have agreed to comply with the Code: Save the Children, Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa Open arms from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new regulations unnecessary but acceptable, provided that they did not cause any “significant change or interference” with its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is the Nobel Prize-winning MSF.
Meanwhile, Minnichi said that the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we don't want to be associated with either side of the conflict."
The authorities of the Russian Federation have recently significantly intensified their policies in the Libyan direction and, with visits to Moscow, delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have become more active.
The head of the Russian contact group on the internal Libyan settlement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the State Duma, Assistant Head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Degov, told us what the objectives of Moscow in the region were and on whom he was betting.
The contact group on Libya, which you are chairing, is almost unknown.
Let's say the contact group on Ukraine -- everyone knows about it.
And here is a veil of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The Contact Group was established at the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Its activities are overseen by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov.
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin.
The reason for the formation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker Mechanique Chebotarev (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board).
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, was set up and supported by the Head of Chechnya, Ramzan Qadirov.
How come you're the one who led her?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group.
Our activities have not been limited to the release of sailors from Chebotarev's Mechanics.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major factions opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government is based under Faiz Saraj. - "Oz") and Tobrook (the parliamentary section that opposes the Government and supports Marshal Khalifa Khaftara, who controls the eastern parts of Libya. - "Oz").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (the Libyan Vice-Prime Minister) we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
It was then decided that, in order to make better use of those contacts, a contact group should be established.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, and engage with all parties to the conflict.
I wish to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to be associated with either side of the conflict; we are engaged in dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
The contact group now includes five people.
Among them are people with experience in the security forces, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to include in the regional team the representatives of the Institute of the Middle East Rana.
There is no permanent presence of any of our staff in Libya, which is not yet necessary.
Are there Russian military advisers, instructors in Libya now?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group includes ex-military personnel...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
Like when we go to hot spots.
Or cities that have been closed to a certain point for us, such as Misurata (where militias are based, which have played a role in overthrowing Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi in 2011 and which have significantly intensified in the years to come).
We arrived in Misurat in January this year.
We were scared, told that there were Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there ourselves, to examine the real military potential, who was responsible for what the rumors were about, what the real role of Islamists was.
In Misurat, we met with all the elements involved in the destruction of the IG in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was taken away from the Russian-prohibited “Islamic State” - UO).
We wanted to see them, meet these people, check out information that they played a decisive role in the destruction of the IH in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these to himself.
And what conclusion did you come to?
Is it not Haftar who won the Islamic State in Libya?
He didn't do it.
Haftar had operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And the IG in Sirte fought the structures that were subordinate to the government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we've invited the people who did this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they arrived -- the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, in Douma, MIDE and Rosgwardia.
You, as we understand it, are in all Libyan regions, and you probably imagine the moods of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think that the ceasefire agreements, the elections that Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj reached at the end of July in Paris can be implemented?
Or again, as has been the case many times in the past, agreements will be disrupted, hostilities will resume, the parties will try alone to seize power?
The fact that Saraj and Haftar have agreed to another meeting has been a good signal to us, not long ago.
In the recent past, both leaders have been very negative about each other.
As for Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Khaftara, and many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misurat, and Haftar was on the same day on board a Russian carrier, Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurat, they didn't believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people who came to us today."
But our challenge is to show that we do not support only Khaftara, but we are engaged in dialogue with all key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar spoke.
Does mutual understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level make it easier for him to study twice in the USSR?
And by the way, does Haftar speak Russian?
Russian, if he knows, it's very relative.
But the fact that he learned from us, of course, makes it easier to talk to him.
And by the way, it's not just him.
When we talk to the military in Tripoli and Misurat, we meet the generals who studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And now they speak Russian very well.
And they're reaching for Russia, and they're kind of nostalgic about it.
Do you consider the immediate lifting of the arms embargo imposed on Libya to be possible?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
Interested, of course, but, as I said, we do not take sides in this conflict and do not want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
With regard to the arms embargo, there have been constant calls from the Libyans for Russia to contribute in some way to its lifting.
The process of drafting a constitution is now under way in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromises and reach an internal consensus.
Then the election will take place, as was said at the Saraj and Haftara meetings.
If elections are held and legitimate power is finally elected (and none of the parties now has that status), the question of lifting the arms embargo can be raised in the UN Council.
To raise this issue now is pointless and dangerous, it will only escalate the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees sailing from Libya, felt abandoned by EU allies.
Can Moscow, in this situation, help Italian partners by using its ties with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is it that the Haftar forces will take control of the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers moving immigrants to Europe?
That's a very timely question.
We're actively working on it.
The Italians need Russia’s support because Moscow has a dialogue at the same time with Haftar, Saraj, Misurat and the south.
The tribes in southern Libya play a major role in this matter, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it a question of southerners stopping the flow of migrants on long-distance fronts?
You mean, on the contrary, they've turned back the buses that Nigerian migrants are driving?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in continuing these flows.
We hope to help bring the South together in the negotiation process between Sarajé, Haftar and the tribes of the South.
But first, we would like to see a common view on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is regarded as an Islamist, a supporter of the implementation of sharia in the country.
How radical is he?
Would that not be an obstacle to establishing relations with Russia or the West?
I'll tell you my personal opinion of him.
In my view, he is opposed to radical Islam.
But Islamists are part of his coalition.
Yes, but it is his own position that Libya must be a perfectly normal country - a moderate Islamic, open world.
And he's also actively fighting terrorists.
How did he get that reputation?
It is created by those countries that do not want Russia to communicate with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, and there is a legislative, executive and judicial power.
There's a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in keeping us out of it.
And we mixed all the cards with them and started to interact actively with both Tripoli and Tobrook.
We are already reaping the benefits of this work: Rosneft has entered into a cooperation agreement with the Libyan oil company, NOC.
The director of NOC, Mustafa Sanallah, with whom Rosnefti's head, Igor Sechin, made a deal, is directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, there was the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess we'll re-sell.
What other economic interests do Russia have in Libya?
Plans to re-sign the contracts concluded at Muammar Qaddafi.
These include, inter alia, previous transport agreements (railway construction), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay for?
Well, they have oil.
So this is, like Iran, the oil-for-service scheme?
I don't know what the pattern will be, I don't do these things directly.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We're actually doing peacekeeping work there.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, help the Libyans to negotiate among themselves so that they can establish order, and Libya has ceased to be an enabling environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libyan people and pushing the terrorists out of there.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that no Russian or other former USSR country was there to date.
He said that he had about 50,000 phone records of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya - OS) and no Russian speech there.
And what nations are these fighters from?
I don't want to go into that detail.
Then we'll put the question differently.
How many of the Islamic militants in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are virtually no Libyans among them, not more than 5 per cent.
The rest of them are incoming.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan negotiations on the example of Paris?
That's the plan.
We are engaged in intensive negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and have offered to visit Moscow or Grozny again.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say right now.
Several visits have yet to take place, and I hope that the time and place of the negotiations will be clarified.
At the Czech Museum, charities raised money for a expensive gift to a sick boy.
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Machola, who has a DCP, a hydrocephalus of the brain and a complete blindness, will receive a special runway on 5 August as a gift.
Sashe, Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region, Oksana Kosareva, and Director of the Museum, Constantine Bobkov, gave a useful presentation.
The money for the gym was collected during the charity marathon "Don't Get Tired of Doing Good" which was held in Melihov on July 15, on Chekov's Day of Remembrance.
On the eve of the museum's marathon, a letter was received from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushino Chekhovsky, saying, "I have no eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get a runner to make my legs strong, and I'd learn to walk a little bit."
And then Sasha's dream came true!
After the performance at the conservatory museum, there will be a concert postscriptum, a well-known pianist, a well-deserved Russian artist, Alexander Gindin, who will perform popurry from popular classical works.
During the charitable marathon in Melihov, the Gnesen Dawid Desert choir, the callers of the Ilya Drozdichin workshop, students of the Moscow Conservatory of the P. I. Chaikovsky and the Russian Academy of Gnesin, and artists of the Melihov theatre of the Czech Studio.
An auction was held for visitors, a book fair and a charitable sale of souvenir products with a marathon logo.
The Melikhovo Museum took the initiative to make Chekov Memorial Day a single day of charity in all museums in Moscow on 15 July.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevska Žitomir oblast near the local football stadium shot several times at the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was aroused by the noise, informed by FACTAM in the communication department of the Gitomir State Police.
The man then entered a café nearby.
He had a conflict in the building, during which a man used rubber bullets to shoot him, wounding one of the visitors.
A 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care and there was no threat to his life.
Police officers and ambulances arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled by then.
Law enforcement officials identified him and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
The man couldn't explain his actions.
He's got a rubber bullet-shooting device that was sent to forensics.
In accordance with article 296 of the Criminal Code, criminal proceedings have been initiated.
The detainee is liable to 3 to 7 years ' imprisonment.
In Kiev, there was a shooting attack in Lukyanovka near Tatar Street on the night of 28 July.
Michelle Carter's conviction for reporting Conrad Roy's suicide.
A resident of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment for using text messages and phone calls to induce her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five more years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She was facing a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy were suffering from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, shook her hands and lowered her eyes.
"She killed Conrad Roy by her actions," the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She didn't accept responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a tragic case that she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monice said that in his opinion, her “age, maturity or even mental illness did not have a significant effect on her actions”.
The Prosecutor read out the statements of Roy Lynn Roy's mother, which says, "It's not a day since I didn't mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I handle it - I try to support his sisters despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Roy's sister, Camdin Roy, said that she was indissolubly motivated by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become an aunt of his children.
"To be with the man who has always been with me since I was born is the pain that will remain with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case is likely to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that would hold a person responsible for counseling a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in the car with symptoms of carbon dioxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case drew the attention of the entire country when it became known that he had been forced to commit suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don't know how many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before she killed herself, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad," and "You just have to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monice said that Carter wanted attention by means of Roy's death, and he barred her from talking to the press to keep her from getting what she wanted.
The opinions of the lawyers on this matter were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for the murder of her British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
A 30-year-old Knox published in the Los Angeles Times her dissenting opinion, saying, "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Evgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a high-flying bird."
One of the best basketball players in the U.T.B. Single League, 33-year-old Keith Langford, left UNICS.
The departure of the American defender of the "Ivestiam" was commented on by the President of UNICS Evgeny Bogachev.
Keith made this decision on family matters, told Evgeny Bogachev.
He's got a little kid, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played UNIX for three seasons, and in each match he showed a high level, 100 percent.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and his game career.
Keith Langford played at the club for three years, winning the silver of the Single League 2015/16.
During the 2016/17 season, he won the award to the most successful player in the Euroliga season.
He averaged 21.75 points per match.
This result is the second since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in the history of Euroliga to receive the prize more than once.
Langford is about to sign a contract with the Chinese Shenzhen, informing Eurohoops.
The American is expected to enter into a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be the second Euroliga star in July to enter the Chinese championship.
Previously on the Chinese CBA, Jannis Burusis moved over the Panatinaicos ex-centre.
A sunburned tourist from Podskovya was evacuated by helicopter in Adigei
Today, Adieh’s rescue workers evacuated from the mountainous area of the Republic a Moscow tourist who had suffered severe sunburns.
The man was resting at the Fish House, at an altitude of 1.6 thousand metres.
A 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure as well as difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescue team was approached by the head of the tour team, who told them that the man had been burned on a camping trip.
Audi is to be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW announced that it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The president of BMW stated that the company believed that “there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions”, referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is located – that were considering banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler announced on Thursday that he would modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their step a review.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with CO2 emission regulations.
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automotive manufacturers of equipment that neutralizes diesel cars is also increasing and it is difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German automakers are under close scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has also been accused of being accommodating powerful car manufacturers and ignoring signs of a problem.
Companies try not to repeat the mistakes of Volkswagen, which concealed the use of so-called “default devices”, which, during testing, could adjust the amount of harmful gases emitted to conform to the rules and were deactivated under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several leaders of Volkswagen have been convicted, while others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in Germany, a former head of the thermodynamics department was arrested as part of the Audi engine development team.
Former manager, Zacheo Giovanni Pamio, Italian, and therefore not protected from extradition and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was subjected to a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission regulations and expanded the investigation, which had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may pose serious problems for Volkswagen: the producer of elite cars is the source of a disproportionate share of the income of Volkswagen.
In Astrakhani, a visitor to the cafe paid for his fake money.
The police received a report from a bank employee about the discovery of a suspicious five thousand roubles worth of money from the general service.
A study conducted at the Forensics Centre showed that it was false.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the region of Astrakhan, the banknote was paid by one of the visitors to the coffee shop who bought the saurma.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with an authentication device.
At present, the police are identifying persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a known forged Russian Federation CB ticket.
Such offences are punishable by up to 8 years ' imprisonment with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs encourages residents of the Astrakhan Region to be vigilant in their financial transactions; it is recommended that traders should install instruments to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers have found a hellish planet where even iron can melt.
After first studying the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysics were greatly surprised by its temperature, which is capable of evaporating iron and other metals.
Experts have noticed that water molecules are so warmed up by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Telescope has captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature makes the water in the planet's atmosphere glow infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to so-called hot Jupiters, gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the solar system, but tens of times closer to the parent star.
It only lasts a year on an exoplanet for 1.3 "earth" days, and its gas casing is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens the lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but there are now fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavanda has grown worse because of dry weather and insect diseases; this has caused constant headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the Provence agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, says: “Lavanda in Provence is indeed at risk because in recent years the plant has experienced the effects of climate change: in the spring and especially in the fall, the rains have been much lower.
It affects the lifespan of the lavender.
And there are little cicadas that jump over leaves of insects that carry microbacteria; in very dry weather, there are a lot of them."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very much needed in perfume and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says, "Besides very long ears with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened, or absent.
That's why we don't have any more parts that contain air oil."
The solutions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as plant spraying with a protective mixture of clay and water and producing more drought-resistant varieties.
Ambassador of the Winter University of 2019 met with Redyar students
Two-time world hockey champion, Ambassador of the Winter University of 2019, Alexander Semin met with the start-up hockey players the day before and gave autographs to fans.
The meeting took place at the 2019 Winter University tent in the context of the thematic week of hockey with the puck.
Any visitor to the tent could have skated in an artificial ice field.
In addition, relays, quizzes and games were organized with a student play of souvenirs and aerobics.
Fifty schoolchildren participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much sports as possible, and stressed that the most important thing at the start of their studies was hard work and the great desire for hockey.
"It's great that there's a platform in Krasnoyarsk like the Winter University 2019 tent, where the beginners can ask questions directly to the team coaches," said the champion.
Note that ambassadors of the Winter University of 2019 are helping to promote student sports and healthy lifestyles among redheads.
The university tent will operate throughout the summer season until September 25, reporting to the Directory of the Winter University 2019.
The State Department commented on the words of Medvedev.
United States State official Heather Nauert, commenting at the briefing on the words of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of the Russian Federation, said that there was a need to find “areas for interaction” with Russia.
Such areas, she said, must be found to “improve bilateral interaction”.
As an example of such successful cooperation, Nauert described the Syrian Armistice Agreement.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the diplomat.
However, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev’s claim of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
“If Russia has said that, it certainly has the right to say it, but there is nothing else I can say about it,” said the representative of the State Department.
Previously, US President Donald Trump had signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, the Head of Government of the Russian Federation, Medvedev, stated that Washington had declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that US sanctions would be in effect for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister believes that Trump's U.S. establishment has been "purely beaten."
The missing man in Pod Moscow was found in someone else's house, lost his memory.
Bodibilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25, under very picky circumstances: he left the car's salon to go to the bathroom.
Seven days later, he was searched unsuccessfully by acquaintances and locals.
And I found Chamil on a stranger's dam in Ramensky.
He was found naked in his bathroom by the owner.
The Dagestan athlete could not explain how he got here or what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was missing.
I.D. was helped by his missing persons reports.
The doctors who came to the bell recorded Hanmetov's partial memory loss and brain injury, reports the Mash public.
There are probably other surprises waiting for athletes.
The intruders who kidnapped Chamil were probably already in his apartment, whose keys were also stolen from him.
July oil and gas revenues exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion roubles
The actual oil and gas revenues from July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion roubles, reports the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as explained by the agency, was due mainly to a higher exchange rate of the United States dollar per ruble than the monthly average of June used for the valuation, as well as to the excess of actual gas production and the projected levels of oil exports.
“The deviation of the federal oil and gas revenues from the monthly evaluation in accordance with the Federal Federal Budget Act 2017-2019 is projected to be +40.2 billion roubles in August 2017”, says the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Thus, the total amount spent on foreign exchange purchases on the domestic currency market between 7 August and 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion roubles.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency would be equivalent to 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in foreign currency purchases by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.
Every working day during this period, the CB will enter into foreign exchange purchases on the organized tenders of the Moscow Exchange on an equal basis during the course of the trading day.
The foreign currency acquired will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury at the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist underscores that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
The weekly newspaper Riodos usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa State related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about safety.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children with them to the office where they had already thrown a grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the board in the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They asked journalists to give names for each column - no evidence, suspicions and internal feelings would be enough.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held by the government or cartels, a whole list of scumbags that make it dangerous to cover the chaos in Mexico.
Violence has not given rise, and there are more and more journalists in the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people have been under federal protection since the attacks and threats; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspiration, co-founder of the Riodos, Javier Valdes Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdés wrote in one of his many books on violent drug crimes.
His absence is very acute, although his presence everywhere is a large picture of Valdés showing his middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" on the front of the Riodos building; two reporters in the 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smile, face wearing glasses or his special panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor ' s office had been set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases had been investigated so far, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As in the case of most of the thousands of murders committed each year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists' killers are rarely brought to justice.
The Riodos press insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they have suffered grief, even though they are more dangerous.
Without information about murderers, without justice from talking about security at meetings, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
In the morning of May 15, Valdés left the office of Riodos in Kuliacan State.
He was only able to travel a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of his car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "the 12th River."
The shooter drove off in his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He still has a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to spread quickly over Kuliacán.
But most people don't talk about Valdes.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions are struggling to fill the vacuum.
Let us not say that one or more people are killed every day in the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with two-story mausoleums of drug kings that are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a minute that the state of calm is just when one of the cartels takes control of the maritime state with important ports and drug routes in the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdés was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, was devastated by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He thinks the murder helped two mistakes.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso López, the leader of one of the rival cartel factions that is fighting the sons of Guzman.
The publication could have angered the sons; the people alleged to have been members of the gang bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he had not forced Valdés to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper had been seized, which had written about the same story.
Valdés was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was regarded as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been out of danger for so long, and his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Northeast, and in 2003 he founded Riodos with five colleagues, selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the subject of drugs," said Bohorkes.
In time, the newspaper earned the reputation of being bold and honest in publishing, selling, and advertising.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to the fact that they could read about what no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riodos won the prestigious Maria Moores Cabo Prize for Reportership in Latin America.
That same year, Valdés won the International Press Freedom Prize for the courage to investigate Mexico's drug trafficking wherever it went.
He openly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to move on," he said at the CPJ Award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "this is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompepiento TV.
"You must accept the tasks that lie on you as a journalist, either that or you're just fooling around."
I don't want to be asked what you did when there were so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?
The staff of Riodos miss Valdés, a joker who fought like a port porter, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to fight alive.
They relied on his order.
He had to always wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, a bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask, ‘ Has his love for one order destroyed him? ’
His death led them to question their calculations of how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
"They don't like you knowing about their wives, children, their legal business, and underground airfields to transport drugs.
"These things were beyond the line," said Bohorkes.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says the editor of Riodos, Andrés Villareal, is that "fear can be fooled... and then what happened to Javier."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer operate in Sinaloa – as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states, where there is a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak government institutions, and corrupt officials.
Landscape changes all the time.
In a room where Riodos' staff gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to bring cell phones in: days earlier, it was known that spy programs sold exclusively to Governments were being used in Mexico to monitor journalists and social activists.
Outside, two policemen hide in the shadow of a wood from a temperature of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They were tasked by the state government to guard the office of Riodos, which is located in a four-storey building in the Kuliacan bourgeois district.
Some half-joined journalists asked whether the police officers were among the 50 per cent of the police officers the Governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that was de facto controlled by drug trafficking gangs.
In the nearest issue, Riodos had three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of Julio Cesar Chávez's former boxing champion's brother.
They also had to expose government spending concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of Kuliacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official announcement of who was abducted or how it happened, so care had to be exercised when the time came to write that everyone in town knew that it was a favorite restaurant for drug dealers and the authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a policy belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which had dominated all levels of government for almost the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo Guzman escaped the raid on the military.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for Valdes' column with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
"We would have known what had happened before," says 46-year-old Villareal, for his skinny bodywork, called El Flaco.
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources have been cut off."
Valdez’s office is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting against the killing of journalists, because employees have become what they never thought to become: activists on behalf of the press.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went the next morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office dedicated to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in Michoacán in the west of the country three days after Valdés was killed.
Found the burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., seeking international support for the demand for justice in the Valdés case.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdes Ramirez, she accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then requested that no more tasks be given to her to cover the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Valdés has said many times that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime, its accomplices in government and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that reporters were killed not just by gangs of drug traffickers; they did so on the orders of politicians and security agencies conspiring with organized crime.
The Articulo 19 Press Protection Committee considers that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out on the orders of the police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up," says Ramirez.
Of course, killing scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
There was a note on her body supposedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her head cut off.
Some publications preferred to close as El North in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslava Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on like El Manyana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed drug cartels with an editorial on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still see danger in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as evidently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015, along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance every day between risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits he's scared to write about the drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for printing, the publishers of Riodos sat on the sidewalk near the office and drank beer when their phones rang at once.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near Masatlan resort left 19 bodies behind, according to confirmed evidence.
The war continued to rage, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
While sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news via their cell phone to the Riodos website.
The next day, I had to redo the first page.
The sirens were picked up in the vicinity, another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes saw if the guards were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
While sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was placed on the lookout of all of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodos continued his work.
"How can you think about shutting down," said Bohorkes, "if the day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her outside to do a story?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, even though it is horrifying.
Researchers reported that the first found remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhino found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved that the experts called it "My Lisa among the dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his scales was redish brown – and to say that he had, in a way, a dark past.
A report published in Modern Biology described it as “the most well preserved in the history of the discovery and one of the best dinosaurs in the world”.
It is a fossil, a recently found copy of a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the chalk period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly good state stunned the researchers who called it “very remarkable.”
This herb-eating thyreophorus is the most well-preserved fossil of this species in the history of the discovery, according to articles in National Geographic.
He was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the Sancor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in North Albert, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled upon something that seemed different from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, an animal was found inside an earth lobe with a mass of 2,500 feet (100 kg).
Now that all this hard work is done, the final result can be demonstrated.
“It's only worth a little squeezing, and you can almost believe he's sleeping,” said the lead writer Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrell Paleontological Museum, where the creature is shown.
"He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and most well preserved dinosaurs, Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs."
Researchers have discovered that it is a herbal, despite being covered with a shell and resembling a walking tank, that it appears to have been exposed to significant risks from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful shell-covered dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used protective techniques known as protective paint, which many animals today also use.
This would allow him to blend more quickly into the environment and avoid encountering his enemies, say experts, assuming that he was being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This creature, 110 million years old, has been widely publicized in May, and is now exhibited at the Royal Tyrell Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and given him the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the museum laboratory, Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group who spent over 7,000 hours digging him.
The remarkable preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the drawing and shape of the scales and the shell plates on his body.
They found a protective coloring, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although the protective coloring is very common, the discovery became a surprise, because the size of the dinosaur Borealopelta is much larger than the size of the living animals with the protective colour.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution chose to disguise confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with protective colors – such as reindeer, zebra, or armored animals – are much smaller and more accessible, indicating that nodozaur had to struggle seriously for survival.
"The serious threat from predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur shell shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Melt Period were," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the shell of the dinosaur also indicates that his skin was to be red brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the remaining contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he sank and lay his back down to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread far further into the deeplands than they are now.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is completely covered by the remaining shaved skin, while at the same time being completely preserved in three dimensions, keeping the original shape of the animal,” said Brown.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked back then, in the Early Mele Period.
You don't have to resort to imagination to recreate it, you just need to snuggle a little bit, and you can practically believe that he's asleep.”
The mellow period is a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, wandering around the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of his fearsome ancestors may have hunted a thyreophorus.
These include the acrocantosaurus, a monster with a length of 38 feet (11.5 metres) and a weight of six tons.
Scientists, whose latest discoveries are published in Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after his death and was mummified in the sea.
The creature was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the millenium mine near Fort McMurray in North Albert, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to museum staff, this is the world's best preserved thyreophorus, along with the skin and the shell, and it's intact, from the face to the femur.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five metres) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic was two 20-inch spikes coming from their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herb - edible thyreophorus was hard on what Canada is now, until the spilling river took it to the high seas.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his shell to the smallest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the bulwark shell plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Gresko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, the degree of security “is rare as winning the lottery.”
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
Fossil residues of the skin still cover the ragged shell plates that surround the animal’s skull.
His right foreleg is stretched along the side, and his five fingers are turned upside down.
I can count the scales on his sole."
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without an I.D.
Mikhail Saakashvili, formerly head of Georgia and then Odessa province in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
In doing so, he did not have the documents to prove his identity and citizenship.
Saakashvili's arrival is reported by the Polish edition Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his performance on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili addressed an event to commemorate the Warsaw Revolt against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not speak Polish, although he tried to speak in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician referred to the topic of Georgia's cooperation with Poland, as well as Ukraine.
That the Ukrainian migration service had deprived him of his citizenship, an opal politician had learned when he was in the United States.
It is not yet known how he was able to make the transatlantic flight without papers.
Previously, the former Governor of Odessa province, Mikhail Saakashvili, stated that his signature on the questionnaire for the acquisition of Ukrainian citizenship had been forged.
The politician stressed that he had not completed any forms.
The investigation of Weinzeher and Olkhovik has been extended until January.
The preliminary investigation of the co-owner of the Renova Group of Companies, Evgeny Olkhovik, and the head of the T Plus Energy Holding, Boris Weinzeher, was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court is considering the extension of the accused ' s house arrest.
The UK representative informed the meeting of the decision to extend the pretrial investigation for the last time.
“The particular complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and examine a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigations in the territory of several constituent entities of the Russian Federation”, the investigator stated.
He added that suspects regularly bribed Komi’s leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion roubles.
According to the investigation, Winziher, Olkhovik, as well as Mikhail Slobodin, the former head of the Integrated Energy Systems, who led the company Vimpelcom until 5 September, paid bribes to senior officials of the Republic of Komi for setting the highest possible rates for heat and electricity, as well as for creating an enabling environment for business.
Winziher and Olkhovik were detained, staged in Siktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped the investigation and was announced as a federal wanted man.
How did one activist know the answer to the question “Who Streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked.
Just a day after arriving in New York, on a tourist trip, St. Louis was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, looking at the facebook tape on her phone.
She ran into someone from high school.
It said, "Police just killed an 18-year-old child, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
After noting that none of her tapes had ever posted that information, which was puzzled, she closed Facebook and opened a tweet.
There were a lot of postings with @TheePharaoh in her tape.
A real-time rapper from Greater St. Louis tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of Brown's lifeless body, spread out in the street, where it would be for four hours.
"It's wild," Ferrel thought.
But death wasn't new to her and her circle.
She put off her phone, and then later in the evening, she went back to the tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of signal tape and people screaming and a man claiming to be Brown's father, who had a poster saying, "Ferguson policeman just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, pulled the trigger of a rifle and shouted, "I'll kill you all... animals!"
"It's a non-standard situation," according to her own memories, "Ferrel said then.
“It's not a murder like the ones we're used to and can be described as typical.
At that moment, I felt cold.
I was angry and weeping."
She took a flight back and flew home the next day.
When she landed at 11:00 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next almost three years was the theme of the new documentary film "Who Streets?", which will be released on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the point of view of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrell was on her way to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower dress and a wreath of color, they remembered a conversation that had been conducted up to this morning countless times, “on the experience of blacks and their condition.”
She remembers saying, "Remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now because a policeman killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong.
"I couldn't help but take it," said Ferrell later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of what has happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and be raised on it.
It must not only be well aware of activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of experience of blacks and their position, and what we must do to become free to be free.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she herself will not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done her a bad favor if I had protected her from it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made the first stop at South Florida Road, a site across the street from a police station that became a sort of tent camp while activists were waiting for reports of Officer Darren Wilson's final innocence.
There, Ferrel and his daughter joined the local businessman who prepared lunch packets.
They collected bags and helped hand them out to protesters.
A little bit in Ferrell's mind has found a new form of activism.
“My activism has changed completely since August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at Missouri St. Louis University, she was president of the Association of Health Students, National Minorities, and worked on food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
“I had no experience as an organizer.
It has come to pass."
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Folyan, one of her co-directors.
Foleyan said that she and her chief operator, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer, “just wanted to document” the events.
Ferrell came up with the question, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?"
This scepticism was engulfed by numerous people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from his pain and endurance.
As Foleyan explained in a recent interview, “We heard that the voices of people who were born and grew up in Ferguson are not the focus of attention, and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folyan had already joined with her co-director, Damon Davis, a local artist known for her activism on the death penalty.
His participation sparked sympathies for the project with Ferrel and with six other local residents, with whom the team of the "Whoa Streets?" project had been in touch for years since Brown's murder.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, we say it ourselves," Davis said.
“It was the most important thing to me, as these people will be represented, because it is how I will be represented.”
Although the project was not about focusing on Ferrell’s experience – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the champion leader, but about how the community is united,” as Foleyan said, it was the most open member of the film.
As a result, "Who Streets?" shows the unexpected personal aspects of Ferrel's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time I saw a finished product.
“But I understood that when you do this job and humanize black people, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell's history rediscusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the Black Lives Movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- the ones who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after the murder of the black teenager Treyvon Martin in 2012 -- are considered to be homosexuals.
“Black homosexual women in leadership support this movement,” Ferrel says. “All because we fight on several fronts all the time.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden.”
Folayan agreed with this statement, noting that “the movement is actually supported by black women and many gay black women”.
However, she insists that “this is not a case of positive discrimination” and that Ferrell was not chosen as the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
"She was the man who awakened this energy," she said.
“On the other hand, it is not a coincidence that she was in the first place because when ”
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, there have been no cameras in Ferguson for a long time, but complex racial links between the community and the police remain.
Ferrel will be on probation for another two and a half years for blocking the highway during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of a place called home, simply: “Bardak.”
She's still holding on to the talk she learned when she walked out on Ferguson's streets three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
Two Salvadoran footballers were disqualified for biting US players.
The footballers of El Salvador Henry Romero and Darwin Serena received long-term disqualifications for unsportable behaviour.
During the quarter-final game of the North and Central American and Caribbean Confederation of Football (CONCACAF), Salvadorans bit American players.
Henry Romero's protector was the first.
The Salvadoran bit the attacker Josie Altidor, then pinched him by the chest.
Then Serene, a midback defender, bites Omar Gonzalez, the U.S. defender, when he applied an angle in his square.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three games and Serena for six.
The meeting itself ended with the victory of the Americans with a score of 2:0, transmitting Goal.com.
A similarity: The artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA.
In the middle of the hall in the Friedman Gallery in New York City, people's faces are hanging from the ceiling on the wire -- white, black, and brown, all inconceivable.
These 30 portraits were made by the painter Heather Dewey-Harborg from the cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent clippings from Fort Levenworth Prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving 35 years for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition on August 2 is called "The Rise of Similarity".
This is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art combines technology, informatics and art, and Manning, a transsexual woman and a famous dissident, who Barack Obama commuted her sentence just three days before the end of her presidency.
Using a computer software analysis of DNA from Manning and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of individuals who could have had such a genome, Dewey Harborg created a deep, though difficult, manifesto about not only the plasticity of DNA data - different ways of interpreting them and the inherent determinization of these interpretations - but also the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born in Bradley Edward's name, but was a teenager who openly claimed to be a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Spy Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her pictures in the prison were not available, so only one photograph of her was known: a grainy black and white selfie, where Manning, in the platinum shade of a wig, clearly felt uncomfortable, was driving a car; with that picture, she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg successfully completed his 2012 project, Visions of Strangers.
In it, an artist made portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence such as cigarettes and chewing gum, extracting DNA from this rubbish and creating images of how these people might look.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a preliminary screening of the new press exhibit.
At that time Chelsea was not allowed to visit and photograph, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait of her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her imprisoned muse became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a comic book entitled "Depressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who painted a picture of how the president would mitigate Chelsea's punishment in the future and be able to visit the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama really decided to free Manning just a few days after the book came out was a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There's something deep and strong about the exhibition opening right now, when Donald Trump is declaring war to people who reveal classified information in government, and inventing new ways to incite Twitter animosity that he's supposed to soften.
When Dewey Harborg was asked about the timing of all of this, she said, "Nothing happens accidentally."
In an artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's huge signature at the bottom (with a heart over "i" in her last name) calls for an end to "automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the opposite side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar from pencil C, G, and A.
With 200 letters (or nucleotides as a scientifically elegant artist), Dewey Harborg was hoping to show how surprisingly similar we all are, at least by our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open the genetic data for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey Harborg; her 2007 video work "Fog Memory" is also shown here.
"The DNA can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exhibit in the same room is the novel mentioned above in the comic books.
It shows Manning in King Kong style over the United States Correctional Cazarm building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they'll win," it says.
"So don't ever shut up."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says an artist welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I still have the creeps when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person yet - as it was visually depicted in comic books - but when it comes, it will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genome simulations, gathered like crowds of protesters.
It's also premeditated, just like everyone at the exhibition up to height (5"2, Manning's height), where the pencil painted genetic helogroups.
"I'd rather put them on the walls, but now I want them to look like a crowd of people," says Dewey Harborg about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like a mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like a movement that stood behind her release."
Professor of Northwestern University and staff member of Oxford University, wanted by the police on murder charges
According to the police, there is a nationwide raid on a professor at Northwestern University and an officer at Oxford University who are wanted as suspects for having been found dead in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to the Cook County Court records, arrest warrants were issued on Monday for premeditated murder without the right to be released on bail from 40-year-old Wyndham Latham and 50-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the records, 20-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after being stabbed multiplely.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, came to the Grand Plaza complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and detectives are now investigating the death by stab wounds, considering her to be a murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Latham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwest since 2007.
Alan C. Kabbage, Vice-President of the University of Communication, reported in an e-mail application that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was not allowed to visit Northwestern University campuses.
“It is now a criminal case investigated by authorized persons, and the University of North West cooperates with the investigation”, said Kabbaj.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
A university representative and Somerville College stated in an e-mail statement: “We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigation authorities.”
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to surrender.
The Chicago Police Liaison Officer, Anthony Gullelli, said he strongly advised the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have any idea where they are, but our attempts to find them are intensifying,” Gullelli reported.
According to Guillemi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Guillemi, the police received a call from the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious report that something had happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene terrible.
Gullelli said that it was unclear whether the incident had taken place on 27 July.
According to him, the security cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were in a relationship,” Gullelli said.
The Grand Plaza guidelines issued an address to the residents, which stated: “The police are currently working on a chronology of the incident, gathering information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident”.
Russian Vice-Prime Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the VADA road map soon."
Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) set for the reopening of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would soon be met.
“A certain stage of compliance has been completed, and RUSADA has been authorized to plan and conduct tests in conjunction with UKAD (the Antidoping Agency of the United Kingdom).
The VADA road map was updated accordingly,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the road map of WADA to restore compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of the work of RUSADA and was recently published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that would present difficulties for Russia.
"All has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA shortly,” he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian antidoping structures should publicly accept the results of the VADA-ordered investigation of Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who claimed that doping in Russian sports was controlled by the state.
With regard to this issue, Mutko said: “We are investigating because our antidoping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no government programs, and we're not going to admit what didn't happen."
Mutko echoed the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian independent public antidoping commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of the Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged earlier problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from carrying out doping controls in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June this year he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Antidoping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the Moscow office of the organization in July, the Director-General of WADA, Olivier Niggley, stated that RUSADA was “in the right direction” to re-establish its work.
Fire extinguished in the 79-story tower in Dubai.
A major fire, which occurred in one of the world's highest residential buildings, The Torch Tower, was extinguished and handed over to the Reuters.
It is noted that firefighters managed to handle all fires by 4 p.m. local time (3.00 msk).
The local authorities reported that no one was injured as a result of the incident.
As the fire was extinguished, the streets surrounding the skyscraper were closed down.
The reasons for the incident are not yet known.
It has been reported that there is a 79-story skyscraper in Dubai, The Torch, which is one of the highest buildings in the world.
All the tenants were evacuated in time.
The unimaginable outfit of the Booze has shaken the fans: pants that don't cover the panties.
Olga Bouzova, a skandal reality host of the "Dom 2" reality show, struck the audience of the Europa Plus Live festival with dances in her underwear.
In front of thousands of fans, a newly introduced singer with a duet from Natya Cudri performed the song "We're gonna be hot."
Both girls came on stage in provocative braces, stitched up in such a way that the underwear of the singers was visible.
Buzova and Cudry were written on their trousers.
Previously, it was reported that a specialist in a Moscow plastic surgery clinic commented on the changes in the appearance of Bouzova.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of NATO-Russia relations
Radio 4 reported this on Friday, 4 August, with links to foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO also criticized Russia for its situation with Crimea and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine”.
However, Stoltenberg assured us that dialogue with Russia was still possible and that further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump stated that relations between the US and Russia were at a dangerously low level, and he blamed the US Congress for this.
The Yekaterinburg Metro is learning a new way of paying.
In October, the Ekaterinburg subway would be able to pay for a bank card, said the CEO of the UAO "I-Net" Pavel Vedernikov in an interview with the "District Gazette".
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 World Cup the same subway system as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Lower Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the Mundial, to use the subway with their bank cards without getting badges or standing in line," he said.
Startups that will help your company avoid becoming another Uber
Aimee Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among his startup staff in the area of electronic commerce, but the polls didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, untrue.
And even though she promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust the process.
“He was never consistent and objective,” said Errett, the manager of a 75-person company in San Francisco, “Madison Reed, which deals with electronic hair-care trade.
She therefore sought assistance from third parties.
A new type of startup in the area of personnel is now emerging, helping companies to find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software that is designed to measure staff involvement, they allow companies to carry out rapid surveys, address certain teams and population groups, offer anonymousness and hotlines to staff, and in some cases allow informants to pass the top management and direct referral to the directorate.
"Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, and where is Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Glint startup in Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
Errett said that she had reached a better understanding of what her employees thought and felt in three years of Glint use.
In addition to the express polls and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers the company's heat map and illustrates which units have more complaints and which managers have a low rating of approval, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are somewhat aware that they need to control the workplace, or they will become another Uber who was involved in the scandal when a former employee posted a blog describing the aggressive environment in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For startups like "Glint", this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for profitable business.
The “Let's Talk About Pay” Internet portal, dedicated to financial technology, estimates that the global governance, regulation and alignment industry could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The launch of Convercent from Denver, Colorado, helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year, against the background of the decline in Uber’s reputation.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently emerged as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized feedback polls, collect confidential answers in real time and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager gets involved, the complaints go straight to the directorate.
“The Court of Public Opinion has seized power from the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company treats employees badly or is unethical, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of client boycotts, staff outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan reported.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, used Convercent for over a year to make sure that the staff were aware of the rules and procedures, and to suggest a simple way to contact the company's headquarters.
Previously, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to look for a telephone number or a head office e-mail, file an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
Often, it was a frightening and awkward experience, reported James Vitrano, the head of the legal office of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to monitor staff complaints.
Now that the company uses the Convercent service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, charisma and unfair pay – can be quickly detected and addressed.
“I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of staff,” said Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management Team of Ruby Today.
“And we protect our shareholders from litigation with staff.”
According to Queenland, companies began to take the ethics, values and involvement of employees more seriously in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed because of ethical irregularities as a result of the Dela Enron.
But it was only when “social networks became widespread” that companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from spreading the virus online.
“Before using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both "Glint" and "Convercent" offer their software as a service, charging companies regularly to use their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity endorsed by venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, "Convercent" received funding of $10 million from firms such as "Sapphire Ventures" and "Tola Capital", bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Besser Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than they did before.
In markets with strong competition, such as Silicon Valley, high wages, and interesting projects, they are just the minimum necessary.
The employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to companies with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in a company, feel that they are being heard, and that the work they do is producing results, they are more committed to making such a company a success,” says Nina McQueen, Vice President for Global Benefits and Satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors earn income when companies from their portfolio are doing well; business from companies is doing well when employees are loyal and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase the dedication and involvement of staff members, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to culture experts in the workplace, it is important to have data on staff involvement.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from its employees, it may give the impression that change is coming.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or if it doesn't come at all, there may be frustration, and the staff lose interest.
“If you're going to ask for 4,000 offers, you should be ready to hold 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Rut, president of the management firm of Kotter International, who had to see companies make a mistake relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don't go to the end, the staff will wonder, ‘Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly staff interviews, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports the problem with the help of Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees, dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is learning more about its employees and hopes that in the long run it will be better able to retain its staff in an industry known for high turnover.
“If you do not try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose clients.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
They're opening a new asphalt in Barnaul on the Krasnoarmey Prospect.
Barnaul has taken decisive steps to address the cause of the failure of the Asphalt on the Krasnoarmey Prospect.
The place where the pits were created twice on the newly paved carriageway (intersecting with the Youth Street), it was decided to open up.
Recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tramway was caused by the swept of the land in an unsustainable, unexploited area.
According to Ivan Garmat, Vice-Chairman of the City Committee on Road Management, Upgrading, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be conducted to survey and eliminate the preconditions for collapse.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is anticipated that the shelling and concreteization of unsustainable communications will be required.
This is reported on the official website of the capital.
The Bruins team has to work longer because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled training twice a day.
The time is approaching at 11:00 p.m.; a crowd of football players from the University of California in Los Angeles is delayed to chat on one side of the team's new training fields on campus.
Some of them pulled their T-shirts off their backs, shining from the sweat after the tense first day of the sports camp.
For many of the team's players, these moments of idleness are a break in the middle of the day.
Players recorded for summer classes, after three hours of training, will go back to the dorms to prepare for final exams, and the next morning they will return to Vasserman's football center to meet at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, the coach of the Bruins team, Jim Mora, said, "The next three days, these guys are waiting for a meat chop."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on the players, actually extended their working day – at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
So the start of the first three trainings at the University of California in L.A. was scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to fit into an already tight game schedule.
The side effect of the lack of two trainings a day has been more days with one training, and Bruins is moving the start of the camp for almost a week compared to last year and is conducting summer school training for the first time in the six seasons of Mora in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have 18 trainings up to and including August 20, before starting official preparations for the first game in the season against the Texas A&M team in September.
Maura said that he supported the change of rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that he had created another point in the game's dense schedule.
"For three or four days, we're giving them this huge burden, this is a serious test," said Maura.
"And they just got over it, they're working, they're great guys.
I think that when we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's gonna be really great."
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make training closed; this is a difficult task because its fields are visible from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, a expensive hotel that has already been bombed with footballs that have crossed the protection grid beyond the gates.
The Breens players should be occupying the hotel from this weekend, but Maura admits that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
"We'll have security," said Maura.
"It's a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger, assuming that someone can rent a room, sit there and record training on video.
If you have a video of the training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security in parking lot number eight.
We'll do what we can with what we have.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
All victims of the terrorist attack in Petersburg were discharged from hospitals
All victims of the terrorist attack in the subway of St. Petersburg were discharged from hospitals in April.
This was reported to the press service of the vice-governor, Anna Mithanina.
At the end of July, three people remained in the hospital, transmitting TV to the Centre.
Let's remind you, the explosion in St. Petersburg's subway took place on April 3, this year.
The bomb was blown up by a suicide bomber, Akbarjon Jalilov.
The attack killed 15 people, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 persons were arrested, including the alleged organizer of Abror Asimov.
Recall that the previous day, Rosmesnadzor recommended that the Metropolitan of Petersburg review the transport security plan, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook reinforces the fact-checking in the fight against fake news.
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of mystifications to independent experts and show their findings under original posts, and announced on Thursday the world's largest social network, which is trying to fight the so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible mystifications, send them to check and possibly show the results of the fact-checking under the baseline.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news that many believed had an impact on the 2016 US presidential election.
This issue is also actively debated in Europe after French voters have been misled by false reports before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany before the September elections, they have expressed support for a plan to fine social media if they do not quickly remove hate posts.
On Thursday, Facebook, in a separate statement in German, reported on the testing of a new fact-checking algorithm, which was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which messages are challenged by independent checkers, people want to have a broader context to make sound judgements about what they read and what they share," wrote Sarah Sue, Facebook news manager in her blog.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of "linked articles" and work on other changes in the news feed to solve the problem of fake news.
Create a novel comic: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's tiny castle was filmed in a music video called "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s served as a shelter for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy spot in the Bule Valley in Kent County, he watched a turbulent history around him, and now he inspired Jamie Rhodes, a yorkshire with a filthy hair and a tendency for historical documents, into a novel-comics.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says with enthusiasm.
"You feel it in person when you hold this letter in your hand."
The castle in England covers the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells about families who lived in Scotty; each story was illustrated by a young British artist, Isaac Lenkevich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhoades, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "The Tooths of the Dead Man and Other Stories", a collection of British Library documents; this project suddenly touched him deeply.
"I could have been touched by a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites," he says.
"It's his fingerprint."
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those days there was a fire to light.
And in 300 years, in the future, you think you're there too.
Oh, I love archives!"
For a man so passionate about old papers, getting support from the National Foundation and the English Arts Council and living in a castle for four months ("I've been there a little bit") seems too good to be true.
Rhoades spent all day studying the "new" Victorian castle, walking through the archives and looking at numerous treasures of property and antique things -- for example, the heads of hyenas on walls or bottles that lay in the hole for centuries.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talked to the foresters, the gardeners, and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then at night, he "dranks whiskey and sits down to write."
The history of Scotty Castle is not very well known because the National Foundation only gained full access to it in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassy, died.
When Rhoades arrived ten years later, the staff were just beginning to deal with the archive, which he described as "what the aristocrats had fallen into the attic for centuries."
The journals, the letters of the British Empire, the maps showing who owned what you think land disputes are boring, Rhoades says, but two families fought for this berth.
It happens, guys!"
In some of the stories of the compilation, the castle becomes a starting point for broader research in English history: for example, in "The Workman", the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Krestian Revolution.
"There is evidence of a riot that took place at the castle in 1380, in a book called "The knightly families of Kent and Sussex," Rhoades says.
"The Crusade Revolt began in these places, and I thought the riot was a good start.
Or were they bound together?"
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle, such as "The Priest", which tells of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Smuggling" about an 18th-century smuggler, Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (which was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug up).
The Darrells are the favorite family of Rhoades who lived in Scotty: "The Gentlemans seem to have been a perfect cheater, always in debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women -- I imagine them as a company of handsome guys who know how to take care of big estate heirs."
After completing his work at the castle, Rhoades is looking for other opportunities to gain unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphical novel about Eliamyanmeaki, a place where there was a sanatorium at the beginning of the 20th century, and then it fell back into the woods.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this, damn it, I have to get back to my real life."
The top 15 banks choose Russia.
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, WTB, WTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank and FC Open, seven other credit organizations are about to leave this public organization.
Thus, exit organizations will account for at least 80 per cent of the market.
But this is not just an option - all banks that have declared a break with ARB are negotiating with another social organization that brings together credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks “Russia”, which is headed by a well-known politician, Anatoli Aksakov, the chairman of the State Committee on the Financial Market, recognized, by the end of the last session, and the most effective leader of the Doum committee and deputy in the number of draft laws prepared.
The conflict within the ARB was initiated during a debate in the Federation Council when new draft laws were considered by the Interregional Banking Council, including a new classification of banks according to the size of the capital of the statute.
At that time, Garegin Tosunyan, President of ARB, stated that the Association believed that the bill was being adopted for the benefit of the largest banks, which were thus trying to limit the capacity of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clients.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, did not always justify the withdrawal of licences from some banks, which was, indeed, objected to by the representative of the CBG: many of the heads of the bank that had been swept, such as the Westprombank, were part of the governing bodies of the ARB.
It seems that this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment has provided a visible reason for the 15 largest banks to start preparing themselves for the association “Russia”, noting that “the effectiveness of the work of the ARB will be low and constructive dialogue within the banking community does not actually take place”.
The depositors are better off.
What's the end of the case?
Immediately answer the fundamental question that arises in the slightest disruption or conflict in or near the banking sector: depositors are not at risk; rather, the reliability of the banking system will improve.
He leads Russia by Anatoly Axakov, who is known to be sensitive to the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: virtually all CB leadership is present at the annual activities of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through expert assessments of the “regions”.
Also, there are apparently no major human and organizational shocks to be expected.
Undoubtedly, the ARB finds itself in a difficult financial and management situation once such powerful and influential actors with their contributions and lobbying capabilities are lost.
However, this oldest organization, established in 1991, has a great potential to continue to improve banking legislation and monetary treatment in general.
It is not possible to say that in Russia's open-ended association, Anatoly Axakov, who stated on 21 July, at a briefing to the Parliamentary Newspaper, that “literally the following day, representatives of ARB banks asked me to consider building up the potential of our association Russia”.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of the bankers in the Association's Council, as well as to give more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiating process is under way, the proposals of both sides are being studied, and an agenda for an extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared, to be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of an international banking forum.
That's where we'll figure it out.
Also, Anatoly Axakov, emphasizing that “the chair is not holding”, called the possible new leader of the renewed “Russia” association, George Luntovsky, who is leaving the post of Vice-President of the Central Bank in September, highly characterizing his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Axakov, who is now resting in Crimea, plans to suspend his leave for one day and to arrive in Moscow at an extraordinary meeting of the Russia Association Council, which is scheduled to consider the agenda for the “Russia Extraordinary Congress”.
The entry of petrol engines into the major cities of Russia will not be restricted
The deputy head of the Ministry of Transport, Nikolai Asaul, stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of petrol-fuelled vehicles into the major cities of Russia would not be restricted for the time being.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we should gradually raise the environmental class.
And that's where the concept goes straight to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, since when?
It's like this at the slogan level of the phrase - let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Shall we shut the whole town down?
"In 20 years - I don't know, maybe this will happen," quotes the Minister's "Prime".
The newspaper Izvezia previously reported that, by 17 August, Vice-Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich had been instructed to study proposals on possible options for the control of electric transport submitted to the Government by the CEO of PAO Kamaz, Sergey Koggin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, are the use of UXO vehicles in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a green card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that a new US immigration plan would be adopted to change the rules for receiving a Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and are supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so by changing how the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law would reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will give advantage to candidates who speak English, have the cash resources that enable them to support themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said, according to the American media.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should bother us.
Before we thought that 2017 could no longer get any worse, there was a new report on technological advances in sex robot production.
Yeah.
Sex robots are at the center of attention right now.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharky, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and FRR co-founder, we must take them seriously.
Users can choose the color of robot eyes, the shape of nipples, and the type of nails.
"People are giggling about it, but firms are already sending it to consumers in large numbers, and we're about to see a lot more of them," said Sharky at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable companions to robots with silicon skin, warm to the sense, and almost human lines controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robots by choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples of the robot to the shape and colour of the nails.
But the fact that a lot of robots have "personality" in comparison to which the Stepford Wife would seem very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix Robot allows users to adjust the quality in robots that they find attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxy Gold sex robots developed by "True Company", which are supplied with an already programmed personality, such as "Cold Farrah" seems shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "smart" character.
"Roxxy Gold has a character that suits yours perfectly," the website "True Company" exults.
So she loves what you love, doesn't love what you don't love, and so on.
She's in a different mood during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she may be in the mood!
The emergence of sex robots is a matter of concern - not least because they replace real human relationships - but most concerned with the subjugated image of a woman, an association with rape, which causes the acquisition of the Cold (read the resisting) Farah.
On the "True Company" website, Roxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and growing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a shift from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex, subject to the option.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still on the margins of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are neither stupid nor aggressive until the free market gives them an opportunity to do so.
It's not a coincidence that these complex sex robots came into being exactly when women's rights around the world were threatened when the White House had a president who boasted that he was harassing women.
The scariest thing in the TV series, "The Story of the Servant" is not graphical images, twisted bodies, and ejected eyes, namely, how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it doesn't seem that big.
The purpose of the sex robot industry is to achieve the physical image of real women (only with porn star ratios) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to look like human beings, to replicate the movements of the human body.
But it's the robots that don't look like real women with their "characters."
They cannot break up with or leave their partners.
They don't have a life or a biography -- nothing that could point to independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, they're beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
A native of Los Angeles, Eugene (Puch), Jeter, who has been a member of the Ukrainian team since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which will start on August 31.
In an interview with the BeBasket portal, the general manager of the blue-yellow Andrey Lebedev reported this.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but unfortunately he's not coming for family reasons.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
With Jeter's direct participation, Ukraine's team won the sixth highest in Eurobasket 2013 and first entered the World Basketball Championships, where the yellow-blue was unable to break the group stage, and the U.S. national averaged 15.4 points, 3 rebounds, and 5 shows.
Jeter has ceased to stand for the Ukrainian team since he resigned as the chief coach of our national team, Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
The male Eurobasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Finland, Turkey, Romania and Israel.
The Ukrainian team will hold their group tournaments on Earth as promised.
There will be five contests in group B, with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3 September), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparations for the tournament, our male team held two control battles, giving way to the Dutch and the Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
It seems very reasonable to pretend to be Mita Romney.
In the Trump era, it was common ground that political disputes that polarized the American electorate had broken up some families at the micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the United States newspapers made columns about how to deal with the terrible relatives who vote for Trump.
I think we're all so tense we're about to burst.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, the left-handed poet from Chicago, who was a long time with the Republicans in her family, came to see me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting in the fight against a common enemy could have a strong effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including her Republican brother, with whom she argued about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely ended up on the same side.
At dinner, it's certainly good; but I can't help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed power into the left flank, but the distorting effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we're talking about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we're not gonna get hit by his tricks.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the background of its standards, will suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself really missing Mitt Romney's old-fashioned madness today -- with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like) -- compared to Trump and both seem very little evil.
When Trump's gone, the next Republican candidate will just be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Parks Department, and the best way in town to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
Horses are formidable and huge, glass fiber pictures on the central drum -- grinning clowns and animals, who look in horror at their backs -- are extremely ominous, and ringing music, strangely, is thrilling.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: the skyscrapers are getting old, the silhouettes of the buildings are too much to cause trembling, and the reality of the city has failed to keep up with its dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still worried about the day I found out that the Suisse Cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet (the "Ye Old Swiss Cottage" thematic pub) but a large roundabout in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old, 11-year-old and 2 women in 40 can have a great time.
If I could put the carousel on the score, I'd put a five, but luckily, no one asked me to.
And at the department store this week, I was asked to evaluate my "experience" purchases on a scale of one to five stars before I had a card on the terminal.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, the same plus the option of 15 percent tip rating is for ordering at the counter.
As a result, not only does the neutral interaction slow down, but it also has to be personalized in a situation that does not involve it.
The poor saleswoman in the department store smiled confuseously while I was tired of evaluating my experience in handing her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital because of chest pain.
Pistoryus is leaving prison because of a second visit to a doctor.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital to treat the cartilage cuts that the prison authorities claimed he had received as a result of a fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office for an initial sentence for manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the door of the bathroom in his house in Pretoria.
Pistoryus said he thought his girlfriend was a night thief hiding in his bathroom.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office announced its intention to lodge another protest, this time against the six-year period of Pretoria, which it said was too soft.
The Attorney-General ' s Office stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be heard this year.
Pretoria could be extended by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect in beating a NTV journalist has been selected for a non-removal subscription.
Metropolitan law enforcement officials chose a restraining measure in the form of a non-removal subscription for a man who attacked a NTV journalist, Nikita Roszhaev, during a live broadcast from Gorski Park on 2 August.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Irina Volk.
“In the context of the investigation of a criminal case initiated under article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (“Boys”) against a 32-year-old man who struck the face of a TV correspondent in the Gorky Central Cultural and Recreation Park, the suspect has been subjected to a preventive measure in the form of a non-removal subscription and good behaviour”, explained Volk.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative report had been drawn up on the suspect for insubordination to the police.
On Wednesday, 2 August, a drunken man approached the correspondent during a live broadcast on VDW Day and punched him in the face.
As later turned out, the bully had nothing to do with the VDW.
On the other hand, according to Kozvan himself, the paratroopers tried to apprehend Moscow.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tenting.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people were detained in Sitonia, who provided tents in an unoccupied location, including two Bulgarian citizens.
They were released the same day, while the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the BTW television channel that Bulgarians were then released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camping and have already imposed severe fines on all those caught while parking in a place not intended for that purpose.
The tests will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia accused the US Vice President of rhetoric during the Cold War.
The statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pens were criticized by Russian MID.
“It is regrettable that Washington is increasingly drifting towards the primitive ideological strains of the cold war, which are completely detached from reality,” states a statement by the Russian foreign policy department.
This is how the MIDA reacted to Pens's words about the “Russian threat” and the attempts he had made in Podgorica to force the crossing of borders.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed to the destructiveness of the choice of “or with the West or with Russia” and the invisibility of the hypothesis of the alleged non-alternative accession of all South-Eastern Europe to NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to remove Kosova from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
“Inviting American colleagues to stop the scoffing of Russia and its foreign policy lines, which are always based on respect for partners and willingness to work together in a constructive manner, on mutual consideration of interests”, states the statement of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Feldsher was injured in an ambulance accident in Podskovje
The accident occurred in the Moscow Stupino, and a paramedics officer was injured in a collision between the inomarc and the ambulance.
Today, about 8:10 a.m., a Mitsubishi car clashed with an ambulance in the city of Stupino of Moscow.
“As a result of the collision, the ambulance turned over,” said TASS in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Moscow region.
Law enforcement officers work at the scene of the accident, and the circumstances of the incident are being investigated.
In Odessa province, a woman threw her newborn son into a plastic bag on the construction site.
On the evening of 3 August, the Division of Police received a report from a local resident that he had found a bag of a baby in an unbuilt private home.
“The law enforcement officers and the doctors who promptly brought the child to a medical facility arrived at the scene of the incident” reported to the Odessa Chief of the National Police.
The doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before he was discovered, as evidenced by the navel.
A 36-year-old local woman was identified in the priority operational and investigative activities.
It has also been established that a woman has three other young children.
As noted in the Head of State, the family has not previously been placed under the purview of the law enforcement officers and has not been placed on special account.
Police officers are currently identifying the circumstances and reasons that forced the woman to do so, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under medical supervision.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature child into the garbage pipe.
Gregory Leps: "I'm fighting, though 55 isn't 30.
One of the most successful artists in Russia, Gregory Leps, will celebrate his 55th anniversary on Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke to the news columnist.
I remember your "potink" on the show.
Special tent in the Lunatics, Gloria Gainor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over Moscow River.
I bet you were pretending to spend your next five-year-old.
Plans come true?
As far as the profession is concerned, it was a good time.
I worked hard, traveled through the country three times, gave 120 to 130 concerts a year.
He released two good albums.
Of course, I'm not what I was, say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock isn't tricked.
Singing the way I sang at my 30s is getting harder.
Still, I'm fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, and I think I'm going to a different level.
That's where you're recording the new album, the first in three years.
Yeah, we're working on it right now.
In fact, we've already recorded everything in my studio, and now we're sending him to a subpoena in Los Angeles.
It's called "Why are you so serious?" by a single song written in conjunction with Timothy.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't put her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we film it.
We'll present the album in November to a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow's Crocus City Hall.
A great American drummer, Chris Coleman, put his hand on your new record.
You think you wanted to get him into your tour team, too?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to see me at the studio, recording his batches.
I asked him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson did.
But for a long job in Russia, they set, to say the least, excessive conditions.
It was about fees ranging from Y35,000 to Y45,000 a month.
Then I thought I'd find decent musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found a great drummer, Max Littleev.
It's better to feed your own people.
Sometimes I want to pick on one of them, not on anything.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly quoted internationally.
It's written by Western music magazines, and it's invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wei, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists came, with another performing technique."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you still can't come to the U.S.?
Are you trying to lift that ban?
I'm not doing anything right now.
There are a number of lawyers dealing with the matter.
As a musician, I'm really sorry I can't get to America.
I've said more than once that I'm studying there.
The more you talk to real professionals, the more useful.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years have not been given the tasks that American musicians have always done.
They sought the best possible sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has refused me entry for ten years.
But I'll still apply for a visa every year to the British embassy so that I can go back and work there.
The rest of Europe treats me well.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a booked concert, but a poster, right?
Yeah, there's a good gym in Monte Carlo. I've played it once before.
Now we've been invited again, and as far as I know, all the concert tickets have already been sold out.
You want to go to "Randew of Lima Wykule," which will start on July 20 in Jurmal?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lyme is a great singer and a great woman who can present herself with a beautiful voice and even a whisper.
After the tour and the anniversary concerts, as far as I know, it's the time you want to go to Vladimir Vysotzky's creative work.
You already have two albums with his songs in your disco.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be quite different.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Wissotzki in about the same performance as he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
There's no other arrangement.
Our famous musician Timur Vedernikov will support me.
I'll try to get Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum on the album.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see what happens.
You and Boris Grebenskov's songs have gradually entered your repertoire.
Why don't you write down his stuff album later?
Boris Borisovich is a great man and a great musician.
I ran into him several times, and I asked him, "Can I sing a song of his?
He said, "Grigory, I'm writing songs to perform."
Please try, sing.
I think it's interesting to write that album.
So far, I don't have a task like this, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn't mind, I might be doing a project like this.
If you don't focus entirely on your production center.
I suppose before you realize his potential, you haven't signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There's a number of performers I'd like to have under my wing, but they're independent people.
You mean Sergey Lazarusev?
Serezha is a brilliant singer, and I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and has his own development strategy.
And now there's Alexander Panayotov in my center, who I was driving at the Voice.
We made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It would be truly regrettable if he did not reach the heights he deserved.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, I'm filming videos.
I hope it's a good outcome.
I'm also trying to promote other artists in my center: buying them songs, paying the poets, sometimes their tracks are in the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they don't reach high altitudes, I'll still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On their way out, they'll get a recorded album, a few clips.
And then, if they want to, they can go their own way, and I won't insist that they return their money.
Although I'd like one of them to make a commercial success and pay me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not gonna shut down the oxygen.
Let everyone work, get through, prove, like I used to prove.
If tomorrow they offer you a tour tour of Ukraine and guarantee you entry into the country, will you go?
I'm still being invited.
These are mostly closed activities.
And as for the big tour...
I was a man of my country, a Russian, convinced to fly to Syria on the same plane that crashed.
If they say tomorrow they need to fly somewhere else in the interests of the state, I will.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret the situation with Ukraine.
Because I think we're the same people and we should be together.
I'm sorry it's not going to work, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40 to 50 concerts in Ukraine in a year.
We met like nowhere.
A very grateful audience.
And with several Ukrainian artists, Ani Lorak, Light Loboda, Artem Loick...
There are a lot of talented people in Ukraine, and it is truly regrettable that they are not now fully able to throw their talents into a broad Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I'd love to invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, like Slava Wakarchuk, and do a concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at this point...
Andrei Opskova was moved from the cosmodrome.
The technical director of the East Andrei Opackov space station began work at the Chrunicev State Space Science and Production Centre.
He had previously de facto been involved in the construction of the Oriental launch site, but due to disagreements with the management of the Centre for the Exploitation of Ground- and Space-based Infrastructure (CENCI), he had been transferred to an enterprise in the Moscow Fields where production would be coordinated.
Mr. Opackov will not have a changer: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished and the function will be dispersed into the units of the Centre.
That the technical director of Eastern and the Deputy CEO of the Centre for Technology Development, Andrei Opackov, had moved to work at Hrunicev's GKNPC, “OJ” was told by the top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as by an employee of the government apparatus.
"He's been working on a new post for a few weeks," they've explained to the industry.
It was not possible to obtain an operational comment from the Centre on Thursday and Mr. Opskov himself was not available for comment.
However, OS has been officially confirmed by HCNPC.
He decided to take over the post of Director of Production Coordination, and said at the plant.
Mr. Opackov moved to work at the Centre in 2013 with his space troops, particularly in Baikonur, and in Plesetsk, on the “north” launch site, held the post of First Deputy Commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Opskov became a criminal figure.
The investigation accused him of being bribed: allegedly, since his submission, regional merchants had been paid for government orders but had failed to fulfil their obligations to clean separate parts of the carrier rockets in the Archangel region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
Its technological development responsibilities in the CENCI extended to various projects, but the main one was the construction of a space launch site in the Far East.
The Federal Space Agency, then led by Oleg Vaspenko, in an interview with OS, explicitly stated that the situation in the East was "critical as early as October 2013.
The fact is that a strategic error was made in planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were planned for the same time, at the end of 2015.
In order to complete the launch by the end of the year, the completion of the construction was decided six months earlier and postponed from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, it had to be tricky: the specialists of the Centre had begun to install the technology equipment in parallel with the non-converted facilities.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Opskov.
Despite the risks and the transport that took place (instead of December 2015, Soyuz only left on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, says the source of OS on the cosmodrome: “We would not have carried out a single launch from the East until now, but would have been engaged in construction.”
Vice-Premier Dmitri Rogozine, who oversees the creation of the cosmodrome, made a joke by calling Andrei Opackov his "space Susan" but he's the one who almost always asked for information about the progress of the construction.
Mr. Opskov remembered and was straight: for example, in an interview with OS, he suggested that the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Specstre) should be removed as the only actor in the East and work directly with subcontractors: "Why do we have to put all eggs in one basket of Special Construction?"
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, the Centre has assumed the responsibility of a general contractor to complete construction and construction work at the start-up and technical complex by the planned launches in the fourth quarter.
According to OS, Mr. Opackov's transition to a new place of work was due to disagreements with the leadership of the Centre on how to complete the construction of the facilities and complexes of the cosmodrome and how to work with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be the best for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in building the East.
The government official, in turn, calls the decision strange: “He was one of the best specialists, finding an equivalent replacement would be difficult.”
According to OS, this will not be necessary: the post of technical director of the launch site will be abolished and its functions will be distributed to the units of the Centre.
A two-professional programme will be introduced in music schools
In the future, children ' s music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture of Saintoslav Blueenko, it is possible to re-read repeat disciplines to students, and the question of paying for the rest of the second degree is to be resolved through special grants to RIA News.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow for two specializations, but at the same time will not contradict existing legislation in the field of education”, said Blueenko.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin's “Non-Child Talk” with the children of the Sirius Children's Centre, a student, Maria Andreeva, reported that she had to pay for recurrent subjects in a second specialty in the CMS at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me that she was in violin and piano class and had competition awards in both directions.
The Head of State recognized her issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian was detained on the wall.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian named Cyril N., who climbed the wall on the roof of a high building, reports the El Universal portal.
The incident took place in the capital city of Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, climbed a three-metre fence into the Nestle office building complex and himself climbed one of his towers.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance or rope.
Got a young man on the roof already.
Officials of the Ministry of Public Security dropped him on the ground by helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Migration Institute.
They find out if the young man is lawfully present in the country.
Meanwhile, videos of a young man climbing to the high ground became popular on the Internet.
Users called the young man a Spider-Man.
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help to ease the WBC.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
However, recent studies suggest the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help to alleviate the symptoms of inflammable intestinal diseases.
It is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, leading to colicing and excrement, chronic or bloody diarrhea, loss of weight and extreme fatigue.
To mitigate symptoms, patients are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at the University of Washington found that the main amino acid triptophan protein contributes to the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the intestines ensure that harmful microbes coming with food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammatory processes are balanced by cells that increase tolerance by protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too disrupted towards inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory intestinal diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacterium in their intestines have increased cell tolerance.
And this bacteria needs a triptophan, one of the building elements of a protein, to trigger these cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a connection between one species of bacteria, Lactobacilus reuteri, which is part of the normal intestinal microbiomy, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more the triptophane was contained in the mice's diet, the more these immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same would work for humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a rich triptopane diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation in the intestines.
Postdock Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganwas, studying a variety of tolerance-enhancing immune cells, found that one group of test mice had these cells, while another group, which belonged to the same line but was kept separate, did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by mice microbiomes -- communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the intestine cells was sequented, and six species of bacteria were found present in mice with immune cells but not in mice without them.
Mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiomy and did not develop this kind of immune cell received L. reuteri, and they developed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then moved small portions of liquid -- without bacteria -- to undeveloped immune cells separated from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it was a by-product of triptophane treatment known as idol-3 milk acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptophane in mice’s food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the triptophane level was halved, the number of cells also halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether by-products of the L. reuteri have contributed to the development of cells in humans as in mice, but people with inflammable intestinal diseases have been found to be defective in the genes associated with the triptopane.
She says, "Perhaps we need to increase the development of these cells, because these cells depend on inflammatory processes on the inside of the intestines.

According to José Mourinho, Manchester United hired the “genia” of Nemania Matić
Manchester United hired a "genia" in the name of Nemania Matić, who considers José Mourinho after a parade debuted in a match against "Sampdory" on Wednesday night.
The player, purchased for £40 million from Chelsea, began with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last pre-season game, United, before the UEFA Super Bowl against Real Madrid on Thursday, and made an impression of being a midbackbacker, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke ahead when they wanted to.
However, since Matich did not participate in the pre-season tour of Chelsea in Asia, he was seriously short of preparation for the game, and he survived only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, required further development before the start of the premiere season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in the way he thinks -- he thinks football," said Mourinho.
“We'll help him prepare sooner than later.”
Like Matich, his new partners, Victor Lindeloff and Romela Lukaku, began playing at the Aviv Stadium when Mourinho began to form his core composition by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
"I'm grateful to the club for getting three out of four," he added.
"I'll be even more happy if they get me four out of four, but they've already done a great job for me."
Former leaders of Lithuania's social Democrats persuade them to stay in the ruling coalition.
Former presidents of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party, ex-premier Algirdas Butkjavicius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former Speaker of the Seimas of the Social Democrats of Cheslovas Jurschenas, appealed to the same party to remain in the ruling coalition.
According to the Parliamentary Gazette, tensions with partners - the Union of Farmers and Greens - have led to a discussion in the Social Democratic Party as to whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
The three senior experienced comrades addressed an open letter to the same party, which states, inter alia, that “The disappointment of the party's comrades in the election results is understandable, but the coalition with the "rurals" has created conditions for us to continue to pursue the social justice objectives that we have initiated in the Government's programme and to maintain the political dominance of the left centre over the right parties”.
In the view of the former party leaders, the debate has so far “revealed emotional expression without specific arguments”.
The authors of the letter fear that their party ' s reckless actions could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
The disabled Anton Mamaev was fined
Mosgorsud commuted the sentence of the wheelchair invalid Anton Mamaev from four and a half years ' imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
Previously, the convicted person was released from SIZO by a decision of the Timirazev court.
In doing so, Mosgorsoud confirmed that the accused was a criminal because he had arranged for the robbery and abduction of a motoraller from a former SWAT fighter.
Mosgorsud reduced his sentence to 200,000 roubles.
“Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes a crime, and accordingly such a person must be prosecuted”, explained the “OJ” by the Spokesman Mosgorsud Uljan Solopov.
In the present case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamaev, the factual circumstances of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, according to which a penalty may be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Assistant Mamaev Vasily Serostanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would have led to a change in the category of gravity of the sentence and a change of sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that he was dissatisfied with Mosgorsoud’s decision.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an excuse, intending to go on fighting for justice.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, did not exclude appeals to the Mosgorsud Court of Cassation and the Supreme Court.
“We will use all leverage up to the European Court of Human Rights”, he said, “RIA News”.
Recall that 28-year-old Moscow Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscle atrophy, became a criminal figure in the fall of last year.
The disabled man claims to have bought a scooter from a friend for 160,000 rubles to sell.
However, the owners of the motoraller, including a former SWAT fighter, claimed that the disabled and his assistant, Vasily Serostanov, had taken their property from them, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Tymiraziev District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Serostanov to three years ' imprisonment and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years ' imprisonment in a general regime colony (art. 162, para. 2, of the Criminal Code).
The Public Chamber, the Attorney-General ' s Office, the Human Rights Commissioner of President Tatiana Moskalkov, joined the case after the disabled person had been placed in the SIZO.
As a result, Anton Mamaev was released from SIZO in mid-July by a decision of the same Timiraziev court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Mosgorsuda.
UNF will prepare a report to the President on the environment
The final Action Forum of the All-Russia People's Front (FP) in 2017 will focus on environmental issues, report to the “Ivest” source in the FNF and confirm the leader of the Aleksei Anisimov movement.
According to him, as a result of the French forum, the President's report on domestic environmental problems was planned and a strategy was proposed for addressing them.
The interviewees in the UNF noted that the report to the Head of State would contain a “deep analyst” on the situation in all the federal districts of the country.
According to The News, the final forum of the FNL will be held in the autumn.
The exact date has not yet been determined, usually according to the President ' s schedule, who is the leader of the movement and has traditionally been present at key FNL events.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts in Rostovna Donu, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulaan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be made at these events, we will form systemic proposals to address environmental issues, and we have told the “Ivest” interlocutor in the FNL.
The Co-Chairman of the Central Staff of the Olga Timothyev Movement, who chairs the State Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the French would report to the Head of State on the work carried out in the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the FAA Action Forum are likely to be combined.
Over the year, we grew up with a strong team of experts on environmental issues, saw gaps in legislation, and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be part of the report we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, Frontics also reported on the work on priority FNL projects, she told Olga Timothyev's News.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues, Sergei Ivanov, would also be invited to the forum.
He had previously participated in the UNF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will be history, and the most important thing that needs to be done today is to launch environmental mechanisms to work for years.
To keep these questions on the agenda, Olga Timothyev added.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), Andrey Kolyadin, noted that, in raising environmental issues, the UNF was acting in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they offered as experts in various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the President, says Andrey Kolyadin to the news.
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded to date, which could give the regions additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the FNL, the regions will be able not only to solve their environmental problems, but also to develop ecotourism, added the expert.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the landfill in Balashik (already closed) and about the coal dust in the port of Navodka (a bill has already been drafted to prohibit the open trans-shipment of coal in localities, one of the authors being Olga Timothyev).
Ecological experts believe that the legal basis for dealing with environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been established, the question is further law enforcement, as well as the position of civil society.
A clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State is required, according to Leonid Bochin, head of the Ecology for All Charity Foundation.
HRC member Sergey Tshiplenkov, head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace of Russia, in his conversation with the Izvests, stressed that a responsible approach to society and business was needed to deal with environmental problems successfully, with few legislative efforts.
As soon as society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much better step in a strategic perspective, the situation will change, says Sergei Chickenkov.
The expert stressed that there was a need to reverse the trend that the violation of environmental law was an economic solution for business.
The British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and the car at the handshake.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip to open the door of his home, to enter the office, and even to start the car with a simple hand swing.
The 33-year-old Stephen Northham put a tiny chip between his thumbs and his index fingers and now, through his firm BioTek, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology.
He joined with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from Royal Winchester, to ensure that the infusion procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
Technology looks like a microchip that's used to cats and dogs, and it only takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also replaces locks in houses and cars with a chip compatible with 300 pounds per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House bill cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars.
According to the records of the armed forces given to the magazine TIME, the White House's decision last month to bring a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost the taxpayers $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One", when the president was on board, became a central element of the 17 July White House event at which American construction programmes were shown.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pens, and White House senior officials have been looking at technological products from all 50 states.
A helicopter made in Connecticut was placed next to a boat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a cargo truck from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the helicopter management, the White House Military Authority ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or “FRAGO”, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of a “unusual” event.
“I just wanted you to make sure that you knew because this is an unusually publicized event,” wrote Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail to his supervisor, the first Deputy Air Chief of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive in the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on 17 July to attend an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and remain there until the lawn was released between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to return in accordance with the working hours limits.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the course of the event, while the guard of the unit remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was not clear from the records received by the magazine “TIME” whether a second crew was required as a result.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using State property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the activity was in conflict with this regulation.
“We asked, among other things, whether it was a violation of Hatch's law, and we were told that it was not,” wrote the commander.
“You seem to have nowhere to go,” the Deputy Chief replied.
The event “Making America” was declared an official event by the White House and was not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance the reform of the health sector, which was at the time in the Senate, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's unusual to ask for them only in the interest of photographic capacity.
Trump was already the subject of discussion in February, when the presidential plane drove in the background during its first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was full of complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House is thrilled with the "Make in America" show, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American material,” says the deputy secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often fly around the Washington Agglomeration and on the South Lawn to train the President of the United States to transport to the White House to an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 carried out 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, the flight carried out for the "Done in America" event was counted to the crew for the necessary training flights in a month.
The unit helicopters also overflew 11 additional hours on that day as part of “non-presidential support tasks”.
According to the White House, the taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not participated in the South Lawn helicopter demonstration.
HMX-1 does not account for the presidential flight budget, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the Department of Defense's VH-3D rate of reimbursement is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records that air time in air was 30 minutes each way from its airstrip at the Quantico Marine Airbase in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“To calculate the cost for taxpayers on the basis of an estimated rate of reimbursement is quite wrong,” Walters says.
“These indicative rates include personnel, services and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual allocation.”
According to a study conducted in 2015 by the RAND Corporation, the reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but indeed take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House spokesperson Sean Spicer spoke out to defend the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to show this week the things done in America,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to build.
Therefore, of course, it is entirely appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter by inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he was definitely sitting in a driver's seat in a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump approached Sikorsky's representatives, making a joke with the press about his own fleet of products.
"I know very well "Sikorsky," the president said. "I have three of them."
Moscow will provide grants for emergency services in urban hospitals
Every year, Lifesaving Grants will be allocated to the ICUs and ICUs of the Metropolitan Medical Clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobian visited the Yudin City Clinical Hospital.
During his examination of the clinic, he gave a thank you letter to orthopedic doctor Victor Protsko, who led the most complex operation to reconstruct the adolescent's foot.
Sergey Sobian also reported on the decision to grant grants each year to the ICUs and ICUs of urban clinics.
Funds will be directed towards the promotion of doctors and nurses.
According to the capital master, the Jewish Clinical Hospital is now one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment to enable its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at the Colomen Rural Hospital.
At present, the health-care facilities are designed to receive over a thousand patients.
In addition to the ICU and the hospital, there are day wards.
The staff of the hospital is 2,800.
The total area of the clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February this year, the medical institution became a participant in a pilot project on short-term hospitalization (SPC).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
Advanced medical equipment has been used in surgical interventions to significantly reduce the time spent in the rehabilitation of patients.
After the hospital surgery, they spend only a few hours.
In the first six months of this year alone, 36,000 patients received hospital care at the Jewish Clinical Hospital.
The clinic medical staff performed 15,800 operations with varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported no buyers of the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank.
In the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), no bids were reported for the purchase of the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank.
This is reported by TASS on Friday, 4 August, with reference to a representative of the NBU press service.
The NBU confirms that, on 3 August 2017, Victor Prokopeni, a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, was withdrawn to coordinate the indirect acquisition of 100 per cent of Sberbank shares (through the Paris Bank).
“No documents were received from other potential investors to purchase Sberbank shares in the NBU”, states the communication.
On 3 August, a Belarusian businessman, Victor Prokopenya, withdrew an application to buy a subsidiary structure of Sberbank.
On 28 July, it was reported that the National Bank of Ukraine had refused Russian businessmen Said Guceriev and Gregory Guselnikov to purchase the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank.
The regulator based his decision on the fact that businessmen had not provided the necessary documents to verify their compliance with Ukrainian legislation.
Sberbank reported selling his Ukrainian daughter to Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The major shareholder of the consortium was Said Guzeriyev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guceriev.
Sanctions against the “dots” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among them Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favour of parent organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, declared in the United Nations.
Elections can be representative only when all members of society, including women, have declared on Wednesday the head of the United Nations mission to Afghanistan.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for vice-presidentship, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
The choice can only be fully representative when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Provincial council elections and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban threaten to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year's election, power is first peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to another.
Hayes stated that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters were women.
The Attorney General confirmed the indictment of Nikita the Whites
The Russian Attorney General ' s Office confirmed the criminal indictment against former Governor of Kirov oblast Nikita Belykh, accused of receiving a large bribe.

The material has been submitted to the Presensky District Court of Moscow for consideration on the merits.
In Venice, fines were tightened for tourists for improper conduct
The Venetian authorities increased the penalties for bathing in canals from Euro50 to Euro500.
Walking around the city in a bathing suit or with a bare torso will now be fined 200 euros.
For 100 euros, those who make a public picnic or ride a bicycle in pedestrian areas will be required to pass the TASS with a reference to the Association of Russian Tour Operators.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide for a fine of 400 euros for monuments and 25 euros for garbage.
Tourists will be informed of the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice through a special company entitled Enjoy, Respect Venice (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) on social media, as well as through advertisements and posters on the city council website, on billboards and at the most crowded tourists.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the Tourism Adviser of Venice, Paola Mar, fines will be transmitted to home country embassies to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she noted.
In April, the Italian city administration announced plans to limit the flow.
In Venice, the number of visitors to the city centre has already been successfully restricted.
Instead of the 100,000 people who wanted to observe the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 guests were admitted to the site.
In addition, a moratorium has been introduced on the establishment of new fast-food hotels and restaurants in the historic part of Venice.
The State Border Service detained 272 illegal persons at the border with EU countries in the first half of 2017; a total of 1,059 illegal migrants were detained.
This has been reported to the State Security Service.
Of these, 314 were detained for illegal crossing of the border and the others for violating the rules of residence of foreigners in Ukraine and other offences.

FS dismissed Lakeov from head of the committee
On Wednesday, the Federation Council endorsed the statement of the Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, Victor Lakeov, and dismissed him from his post.
He remains a senator from Khabarovsk province.
A statement requesting his release from the lakes last week.
He explained his decision on the need for rotation and his desire to change the rhythm of life.
The Senator also noted that the decision to leave was not immediate.
Since 1996, Victor Lakeov has represented the legislative assembly of the Khabarovsk province in the Russian Federation.
The Senate has been in charge of the Defence and Security Committee since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers of drilling.
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electric energy users have been beginning to bear fruit for decades.
Since 1 September, the cost of electricity in low voltage for industrial recipients has decreased by 25 per cent.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the Russian Federation, in accordance with the Decision of the Government of the Russian Federation “On the amendment of the Regulation on the wholesale market for electricity and power and on the combined forecast balance of the production and supply of electricity (power) within the framework of the Russian Unified Energy System for the constituents of the Russian Federation” (No. 842), established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electric energy for drilling manufacturers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have overstretched the thresholds of the Moscow cabinets in futile attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighbouring Irkut region with the cascade of hydroelectric power plants in Angar, which comes from Baikala, for which Buryatia is the main catchment area.
And it was only this year that the changes began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 roubles/kWh to 3.93 roubles/kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of Buritia by decision of the Federal Government on the list of wholesale market price zones for which the characteristics of wholesale and retail markets are determined, industrial consumers have emerged.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning because the population of Irkutsk region pays for kilowatt/hour 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to give at least an approximate date for new tariff shifts towards a lowering point for Buritia.
Scooter didn't get scared of the Ukrainian Attorney General's Office and flew to Crimea.
The legend of electronic dance music came to Crimea without fear of threats from the Office of the Procurator-General of Ukraine.

Previously, the German edition of Bild, referring to the Deputy Procurator General of Ukraine, Yevgeny Jenin, reported that musicians could be sentenced to up to eight years ' imprisonment if they arrived in Crimea, which is considered to be temporarily occupied territory in Kiev.
Scooter's performance at the Balaclave Festival, called #ZBFest, is scheduled for August 4.
#ZBFest is hosted by Golden Balca to celebrate International Champagne Day.
Scooter, one of Germany's most famous groups, was founded in 1993.
Ace's last album was released in 2016.
In addition to Scotter, the festival will be attended by Sergei Galanin and his group Serga, as well as Garik Sukachev and Brigada C.

The National Union of unskilled, municipal and boiler workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow.
The union requires guarantees from the managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie's in connection with his long-term obligation to produce at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has been silent about the future investment at the Chicago site.
More than 500 people work in a factory that produces, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, reports that over five million pounds have been invested in the facility over the past few years.
The company adds that, in the event of any change in the work of the facility, the employees and representatives of the union “are the first to know about them”.
In a letter to the company's head of the facility, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded that McVite's react to the concern that funding would not be used to upgrade production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy stated: “The members of our union are deeply concerned that we cannot obtain clarity from the CEO of the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tolcross.”
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is high in local society and in the Greater Glasgow; this is the most important pillar of decent work in high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, the growth of the subsistence minimum and the chronic decline in production, the East End Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of production in the McVition's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “the head of the Transversian facility only yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of GMB, and the company will respond immediately, because we appreciate our constant cooperation with union staff and representatives.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with GMB staff and representatives, where we openly discussed a number of issues.
We talked to the staff about how, like all companies working in the most competitive and unstable economic environment, we are constantly reviewing our actions – and this concerns all our facilities and activities – to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Transcosian facility, especially in production lines and improved performance.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and in the event of any change in the work at this site, the employees and representatives of the union will be the first to know.”
Putin said that the authorities would not give orders to Rosnefti and Gazprom.
Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petroleum Company (VNHC) should involve the Kremlin and the Cabinet, but no one would give instructions to Gazprom, like Rosnefti.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin’s request to help resolve the controversy.
The Head of State pointed out that the relationship between Rosneftew and Gazprom should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of a gas agreement with Gazprom for VNHC jeopardized the project's duration.
Sekin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue was ongoing.
Gazprom proposes to find gas resources from Rosnefti perimeter, but we don't have that kind of resources," he added.
Recall that Rosneft asked to be allowed to use gas from the Gazprom field in Kirin, located on the Sahalin shelf, for the Eastern Petrochemical Company.

Did SVU warn Barcelona about Naimar's transition three years ago?
A member of the La League may regret his interest in Marco Verratti.
Pari St. Germaine will not stop stalking Naimar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record three years ago?
The sensational proposal revived the summer transfer window when League 1 was ready to break the world record at the cost of the transition, more than double the previous target of returning Paul Pogba to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transition is over, Naimar will become the world's most expensive player, as well as the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, as SGW offers him a salary of more than £500,000 a week clean.
It is known that Barcelona is furious about how the proposal was put forward and how Naymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, according to a source close to the leadership of the Qatari club, the club has always done its best for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned of this opportunity three years ago by the President of SVU?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Mathuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a strong warning to any club that would like to lure one of the best players in the SWU.
“I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we're going to fight them, we're going to propose to their players,” said Al-Hhalaifi.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they'll have consequences.”
It appears that Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed an interest in Marco Verratti's SVU paramilitaries.
PSW has made it clear that it will not release the Italian player under any conditions, and it is now likely that Barcelona is experiencing the consequences of its offer in terms of losing one of its most valuable players, Neumar.

They told me about the work on cleaning the lake.
Then the boys were shown in an open container near the container, which they prepared for breeding.
First, Putin let some boys out of the sack.
Then I pulled a special lever on the lid of the container and let the others out.
Also during the visit, the leader directed the environmental situation on Baikal to be addressed and the road to Olhon Island to be built.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, one volume is required, and another volume is required.
"I want to figure out what's actually going on with the funding there," stressed the Russian leader.
Recall that during the forest fires of 2017, the towns of Buritia, Irkutsk oblast, were covered by fire, and homes and building buildings were destroyed.
In Ukraine, Russians were offered to be sent to prison for illegal border crossing
