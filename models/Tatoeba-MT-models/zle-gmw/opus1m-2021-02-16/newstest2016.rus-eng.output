The social map of the resident of Ivanov oblast is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the continuation of the public passenger transport allowance.
Since 24 September, there has been a change in the procedure for the organization of favourable travel by citizens using the social map of the Ivanovsky region.
According to the press service, the Government of the Russian Federation in the Ivanovsk region reports that the changes provide for the maintenance of the public passenger transport allowance and bring the scheme of social map calculations into line with the requirements of Federal Act No. 161 of the FZ “On the National Payment System”.
At the same time, the social map of the resident of Ivanov oblast is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application have changed.
For example, the replenishment limit is no longer set for travel as it used to be, but for money, with winter and summer periods of not more than 400 roubles in winter and not more than 800 roubles in summer for the current month.
Now, social card holders on transport receipts will have to track the cash balance rather than the number of remaining trips.
The cost of favourable travel for citizens would be 1/2 of the carrier ' s tariff.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed for the regional budget.
The schedule for the replenishment of the social map remains the same, from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new arrangements for travel on the social map will have a number of advantages.
For example, it is possible to keep a detailed record of the expenditure of funds on the social map to the point where the amounts are accurate.
In addition, there is the possibility of refunding credits but unexpended funds.
In addition, the scheme of payments with the carriers is becoming transparent, since now half of the cost of travel is paid by the citizen and the same amount is paid to the carrier.
No commission will be charged when the money is placed on the map.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Ivanov Road and Transport Department, reported that more than 33 million social map trips were undertaken in 2014 in the region, and almost 25 million in 2015.
More than 470 million roubles are included in the regional budget for the provision of preferential travel of citizens using a social map.
As at 1 September, the reimbursement amounted to more than 312 million roubles.
During the 911 call, the teacher confessed to the murder of a friend.
During the 911 call, the university professor Shannon Lamb told the police almost without trembling that he had shot his friend and that he needed staff to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that there was a dog in the house who was alive, but probably upset, and said that the family contact of the deceased could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a note that was negligently written on a white sheet of linted paper, saying, "I'm sorry, I wish I could get it all back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to the authorities that Lamb signed.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who was conducting two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had been able to travel 300 miles to a university campus where the police thought he had shot all the respected history teacher Ethan Schmidt on the doorstep of his office.
The Chief of Police at Delta University, Lynn Baford, reported that the university officials learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb had made that true 911 call shortly after.
By the end of the day, there will be one more victim: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, the authorities were still trying to put the motivations that led Lamba into one picture.
Information shared by investigators from both sides of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped to draw up a portrait of a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gauthia, where Prentiss died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote in which he expressed appreciation for the “precious people” he had encountered in his teaching life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke well about Lamb, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb had told him at the end of the school year 2014-15 about his struggle with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in university employment regulations meant that the doctor ' s degree, which Lamb had worked so hard to obtain, would not guarantee him the automatic appointment of a teacher.
University President William Laforge said he didn't know anything about the Lamb- Schmidt conflict, but "it's obvious Mr. Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
The police attacked Lamb after his escape from campus when he was on his way back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
His engine was still on the driveway.
It was not clear why Lamb had come to the house, although Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at a university with 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and teaching.
He received a doctorate in pedagogical sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and fun man.
Carla Harston told me she was 15 years old and Lambu was 20 years old when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool older guy who for years tried to teach her how to play guitar.
In those years, he was a success for women.
All the girls were melting when he was around," says Harston, who is now 40 and lives in Jackson, Brandon's suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss must have met for a while.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there's no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gothia in a brick house, whose back side goes to the canal.
According to the police, the dog's fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Sean O'Stin, reported that they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends, and that they had a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's completely depressed," said O'Stine about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and was playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Stin told me his daughter wrote music and sang.
Prentice was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator in a gloomy-lighted bar in the Gothier suburb, said that he had last seen Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and lip harmonics for a few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were having fun and making fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, a dead teacher, conducted freshmen's seminars and specialized in the history of Native Americans and colonial America, told Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three little kids.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student self-government.
At Delta University campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university professors, staff, students, and community members, participated in a memorial candle lighting ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang the Bright Morning Star and the Amazing Grace.
The classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforge.
Crisis over.
It's healing day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped prepare the Assocated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in response to the police statement that Lamb's 911 call came after Schmidt's murder, and that although Lamb spoke of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season.
Toys R Us reports that he will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as he did last year, and that the toy and toy retailer will assure him that he will allow regular staff and temporary staff to work longer hours.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work at shops and wholesale bases throughout the country, which is less than the 45,000 that were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would start interviewing applicants this month and increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although it is only a few months before the holidays, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to have enough staff in shops and on the sale, shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is making jokes about dating Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Rear to the Future" was a big event for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons, too.
"We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the royal family to arrive, and I noticed that the place next to me was free, and it came to me that Princess Diana would be sitting next to me," he said in the trailer by the soon-to-be-screen documentary "Rear in Time."
The film starts, and it comes to my mind that I'm literally at a distance of my arm and in one fake yawn from dating Princess Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary on the film "Rear to the Future" includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemekis and executive producer Stephen Spielberg.
The film premiered 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spielberg, "it is undoubtedly the greatest time travel movie ever made."
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and some cinemas in October.
UN Head states that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon states in response to Russia's military support for Syria that there is no “war solution” for almost five years of conflict, and the increase in armaments will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN head again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations in order to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon stated at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council — the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France — during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the differences in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, had made the situation “unsolved”.
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they had shown in addressing the issue of the nuclear programme on Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 poll results that show Donald Trump isn't kidding.
Some tried to label him a provocateur.
Others turned away from him, taking him for a joke.
And some people want a scandal.
But no matter how many Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's high profile in the polls, they have failed (for the time being).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Trump's two-digit advantage, and some are starting to ask seriously what this means to a real estate magnate in terms of the chances of being nominated.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to nominate a Republican party.
Experts point out that at that time in 2011, Rika Perry gave up his popularity to Herman Kane, none of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there's a lot of reasons why he'd fight in the general election.
But external groups, such as the "Political Activism Sub-Committee" of Jeb Bush, and the economic conservative group "Growth Club" recognize the unrelenting power of Trump and begin to get their dollars to overturn it.
Here are some of the polls that indicate that a real estate magnate is not just an intermediate phase:
The sympathy ratings for Trump have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University revealed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive attitude towards this real estate magnate.
By mid-July, that was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, this was 52 per cent.
Now, six of the 10 Republicans have a positive attitude toward Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators are at the top of the initial stages.
A quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of the Republicans were positive about Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters would have Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said that they were either "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of ten say they'd be "dissatisfied" if he were a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they'd be "excited" against 40 percent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
Next to the level of excitement?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republicans say that they will be "unsatisfied" or "dissatisfied" if Jeb W. Bush's favorite student becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temperament is a problem.
While Trump has been widely criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent of voters across the country believe that the Magnatus has the right temperament to be president, as the ABC News/Washington Post poll on Monday showed.
The same figure appears at the country's first closed assembly in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the same person who could be the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he's not the person who can be effective in his post, and almost six of the 10 independent voters say that his temperament is not appropriate for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to that thought.
When they wear their know-how hats, the Republican voters think Trump is serious.
Asked who was the most likely winner of the GOP nomination, four out of ten said Trump was the favorite, according to CNN/ORC last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of ten bets on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters had never had the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported a possible candidate, Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign to be convincing.
Even if the Republicans were united around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that such dispersion is likely to have the advantage of Trump, while those who do not support Trump are evenly distributed among more than a dozen other supporters.
But a survey conducted by Montmouth University in early September shows that in the hypothetical one-to-one competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always receives majority support.
It's 13 points ahead of Carly Fiona, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush 19 points ahead, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points ahead.
He's got a tie with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who's around him?
Ben Carson beat a businessman to 19 points in a hypothetical one-to-one competition.
A little more than half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their mind.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of the voters supporting Trump say they're confident of their votes.
Obviously, much can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, Trump's most intense competition at the moment is with an outsider colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their minds are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” two months ago in his campaign opening speech, immigration has become the most relevant topic in conversations in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s sham has turned key voters of Latin American origin away from the Republican party and prevented rebranding.
But according to the ABC/Post poll on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration attracts attention, Donald Trump seems to remain in the same position.
The government's disappointment is gaining new momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now rely on the support of about half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their outside status.
Six of the 10 Republicans on Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider rather than a man with government experience.
And they're also offended by Washington.
A survey of Des Moins Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were disappointed by the Republicans' activities in Congress, with 54 per cent “unsatisfied” and 21 per cent “in rage”.
The government will decide the fate of the pension indexes in October.
Vice-Prime Minister Olga Holodec of the Russian Federation stated that the government is currently looking for options to implement the 2016 Pension Indexation Act to the real inflation rate, and is transferring it to the WG.
It noted that a solution should be found by 8 October, by the time the draft budget for the following year was submitted to the Government.
In addition, Kabmin is discussing the option of extending the decision to freeze the accumulated pension of Russians.
The hungry noted that the amount of pension savings is 350 billion roubles.
About the same amount as the indexing of pensions in full for the following year.
According to the Vice-Prime, there is not yet a final decision on who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
The hungry person believes that it is not entirely fair for a person not to work on his own initiative and not to treat socially vulnerable categories of citizens.
The media have previously reported that two options for balancing the State budget are being considered in Kabmin.
Why are the eyelids often irritated and redned?
The optalmologist Tatiana Levasov responds:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from many small particles that settle on them.
By forgetting to cleanse the century regularly, we often contribute to the development of bluffing.
The exit is simple:
Do not trim your eyes with dirty hands and carry a special wet napkin for the century;
At least 1-2 times a day, clean up the edges of the century from the harmful substances stored in them in the day.
Cleaning procedures should also be supplemented with warm compresses with herbs (salvey, chamomile) that lighten the dense secret of the saline glands and then massage the edges of the century, which should be carried out in circular motions of the fingers;
Do not use alcohol by washing your makeup.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and further dense the secret of the saline glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear men have created a nuclear warhead.
The North Korean authorities have reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the Yongben nuclear complex, is operating “at full capacity”.
This was reported on the country's Central Telegraph Agency's website.
It is noted that the DPRK is prepared at any time to respond to “the US aggression and nuclear threat” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “by quantity and quality”.
The last nuclear test was conducted by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
However, no plans have been made to resume the full operation of the reactor since then.
Pyongyang claims he managed to create a nuclear warhead.
The DPRK has also tested medium- and short-range missiles on numerous occasions, writing politic.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded that the reference to brotherly peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
LDP leader Vladimir Zhirinowski believes that the reference to the union of brotherly peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He announced this during the State Duma meeting, reports the Russian News Service.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can't stand," said Zhirinovsky.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all four-point members containing this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinowski stated that the current anthem needed to be changed to "God save the king", and the Russian tricolour replaced by an imperial flag, writing politic.ru.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, it must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that the root causes of the problem need to be addressed.
If Europeans care about refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That is our opinion on this issue.
"That's the essence of the refugee question," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to achieve consensus.
However, if we are to make real progress, they will not be possible as long as people die, as long as the bloodshed continues and as long as the people do not feel fully secure.
“In this way, we can reach consensus, but we can't do anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria”, stressed Al-Assad.
Let us recall that some 500,000 migrants, including those from Syria, have arrived in the European Union during this year.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world had been the largest since the Second World War.
It may be that thousands of militants of the extremist group “Islamic State” may be among the migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia may use the situation to create their cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The inhabitants of the German city have organized a holiday for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become a leader in hosting refugees, although it has recently strengthened border controls to contain their influx.
The authorities estimate that some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts refer to significantly higher numbers.
More than 90,000 refugees have already arrived since the beginning of September.
A BBC correspondent, Jenny Hill, visited Darmstadt, whose residents offer a very warm welcome to migrants.
Jeremy Corbin debuts on the Prime Minister's questions session.
Following the election of Mr. Corbin, his debut at the question-and-answer session is expected to be very much awaited by the Prime Minister.
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, will soon speak for the first time at the Prime Minister's question session, for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will address the first of the six issues in the afternoon; he will most likely be closely followed by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He made a call for “lower theatre and more facts” at a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could miss some meetings, leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbin ' s first parliamentary test as leader, following his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Tread Junior Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour leader to stand silent during the performance of the national anthem on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, provoked criticism from a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several leading articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
Mr. Corbin's Spokesman stated that he had “stayed in respectful silence” and recognized “the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain”.
However, Mr. Corbin's shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem “independently” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play on Mr. Corbin's team, expressing differences on economic, defence and international politics, while less than one sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant said that political differences would also “couple” the Labour Party after Mr. Corbin was appointed to the European Union and government restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Treadunion conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at eliminating the very idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Shadow Minister of Labour and Pensions, stated that there was “full clarity” in the party that it had been opposed only to the Government's plans to reduce the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party to meet David Cameron at the "courier box" in the last 10 years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Leader, who promised a different approach to politics, stated that he had “involved collective resources” to gather ideas for Mr. Cameron's questions and had received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from the Ailington North district stated that the Prime Minister's questions were causing excessive confrontation and that he would refrain from the witty answers and the exchange of thorns, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Economy in the shadow office, would replace him with the Prime Minister when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also offered the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercoe, to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to leave the political style of the “marginal balagan”, often associated with the procedure, to the Prime Minister, but he acknowledged a few years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister’s questions have become a key indicator of the leader’s views, their ability to run the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires extensive reforms.
"Shopping in Yoburg." Homeless young people who learned to be photographers.
The Johannesburg Business Center is a difficult place for homeless people.
But a group of former streetmen found a way to master the craft and earn a living.
"I've been filmed in Yoburg," a non-profit studio that trains homeless young people to take pictures of the neighborhood and make a living on it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound sterling increases as wages rise in the United Kingdom
The pound grew against the background of the increase in wages in the UK, with the FTSE 100 index rising as a result of an offer to purchase SABMiller.
Between May and June, British earnings, less bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate has been the highest since 2009 and was welcomed as an earlier shift in forecasts for possible increases in quotations.
The Pound sterling grew by more than 1% against the dollar, to $1.505, and 0.84% against the euro, to be 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
Against the background, SABMiller shares grew by 20 per cent as a result of a purchase offer from AB InBev's competitor.
The deal would bring together the two largest brewery companies in the world, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artoys, Peroni and Grollsch.
Burbery stock grew by 0.9%, with encouraging news from a competing group of suite producers, Richemont.
Recent sales data on Richemont exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China - in the key market for Burberry - have begun to rise again.
Glencore stock grew by 5% after a mining giant announced that he had managed to earn $2.5 billion through equity, as was done as part of a debt reduction strategy.
The stock of the Mondi paper and packaging group was leading the drop in the index by 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs lowered the group's rating to "sell".
The JD Sports stock grew after the sports clothing company reported an increase of 83 per cent in the pre-tax income to £46.6 million in six months.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages can prevent expansion.
The executive director of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers”.
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in labour costs, he says.
Costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a bottom-up campaign to fight Aldi pressure
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi pressure in South Australia and Western Australia.
A bottom-up wholesale food supplier launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the forthcoming injection of Aldi 700 million dollars.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of the 120 stores in South and West Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relations with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and on "Adelaide Show".
Retailers and IGA suppliers are joining the campaign, such as the producer of Simmo's ice cream from Dunsboro, who offers a taste in IGA stores, and shop owners who sell tickets for South Australia's football league games with discounts to regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on 29 September, the day that this wholesale supplier of food, alcohol and household goods will be spending its annual investor strategy day.
In South Australia and Western Australia, IGA stores account for almost 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and West Australia are known as traditional routers, so the market is more favourable for IGA retailers than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA, compared with about 14 per cent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will take out 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening their first shops, taking out sales from all players present, but mostly from independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst of Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA Ritters may lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in SA and 30 in WA next year, making sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
Loss of income and sales of food at a high constant cost of Metcash may cost the company some 13 million income prior to payment of interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass' leading stock manager, founder of Magellan Financial Group, noticed at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "could be very likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to publicly comment on Mr. Douglas's comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the board of directors of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The share of IGA in the market has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, and Metcash’s income from the food business, which it supplies to some 1,200 IGA Ritters, has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 due to operational deconversion and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million each year to equalize retail prices with those of Coles and Woolworths for thousands of items each week, and helping IGA Ritellers to remodel outlets, as well as offering a fast-growing range of fresh products and a wider selection of branded foods.
Metcash Director General Ian Morris said that price-equivalent and re-equivalent trading space was gaining momentum, and he hoped that the company would achieve an increase in net profits in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanashi Kokkinakis is supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Tanashi Kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanashi Kokkinakis suffered indirectly in the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more credit than critics, as President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy, says.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in a talented duo and often called "Special Ks", was involuntarily the focus of attention due to Kiryos' shameful confrontation with Stan Wavrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly thereafter, during a hot qualifying match at Cincinnati, the judge at the tower had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, and Harrison said, "The Vavrinca was to put on Kiryos' spades, and I was to put on this guy's spades."
Since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a racket after the cramp in his leg saved Richard Gaske from a possible defeat on US Open, Healy loyally defends Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be second after Bernard Tomić in solitary confinement in the semifinal Davis Cup v. Britain.
"I'm really worried about one thing, namely, that Tanashi got involved in a conflict," said Healy.
He really broke the racket when his leg went down on US Open, but he's not the first player to break the racket when hopes collapsed, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very good in quite provocative US situations, with Harrison, and so on, and I'm sure he's trustworthy.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he's working hard, he's got a great fit for the team, he's never had any problems with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's in intensive training, he's in excellent shape, he's a very focused and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match that began on Friday, believing that mutual consent was the right option for everyone, but hoping that the Canberra guy would return to the team as a long-term player.
"Before all, we want the team to focus completely on the match, not the controversy around [Kirios]," said Healy.
And I think that Nick gained power very quickly, as people like Federer and Marray prove, he grows up in front of the public, he makes a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary to get him out of focus for a while so he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration Crisis in Europe: Hungary declares an emergency, closes the border, apprehends migrants
After declaring a state of emergency, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on the southern border on Tuesday and detained those who were attempting to enter the country illegally in order to contain the flow of migrants.
There had been riots on the border, with hundreds of migrants congregating on the border territory, which had been sharply repressed by the Serbian authorities.
While stuck indefinitely on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland broke tents and settled in the area.
However, the discontent was on the rise.
When a police helicopter circled over them, migrants shouted "Open the border" and shouted insults against the Hungarian Special Police.
Some protested against food and water.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared the expulsion of migrants back from Hungary “unacceptable” when more and more came from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
Negotiations with Brussels and other countries are needed in the coming days,” said Ivica Dačić in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serb border began the day after a bloc of 28 countries was unable to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to assume overall responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece and expressed the hope that an agreement would be reached in the future (in the next month or by the end of the year) whereby EU member States would receive an additional 120,000 refugees, including those from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a European Union emergency summit on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis affecting the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect swift action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to deal with the crisis, enabling them to block roads and speed up asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Siillarto, stated that his country was also planning to erect a barbed wire fence on the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants across the country now that it had completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were connected to urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “narrow spot” and border crossing point of the European Union for displaced persons, many of whom are refugees who are victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Victor Orban insists that most of the people who arrive in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life than refugees who are victims of the wars that are entitled to protection, and this view is strongly at variance with the views of other EU countries, Germany.
The new laws that entered Hungary at midnight now make it an offence to cross or damage a four-metre (13-foot) barbed wire fence constructed by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison sentences for human trafficking accused.
“Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares a state of emergency”, said a government spokesman, Zoltan Kovac, in the southern city of Séged.
We make it clear that illegal crossing is a crime.
Technically, Parliament is still required to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the reporters of the Associated Press, who are at the border, have been monitoring the presence of armed personnel with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Diardi Bacondi, the National Security Adviser to Orban, reported that 45 persons had been caught by the authorized authorities trying to cross the border at the border itself, and 15 had been caught inside the country.
They have crossed the border by breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
On Tuesday morning, the Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia, bringing a rail wagon wrapped with barbed wire to block one of the passages.
The riots broke out on the main passage across the border near the city of Ryoske, Hungary, as the Hungarians had set up a service space to pass people inside a metal container, and crowds pressured each other to break in.
Some 20 individuals were able to enter, with thousands remaining outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main road from Serbia to Hungary and announced that food and water would be abandoned until they were allowed into Hungary.
2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders has been halved in the national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit advantage in the Democratics race for nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is following her.
Clinton now has 47 per cent support among primary democratic voters (down from 58 per cent), and Sanders is second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he intends to participate in the presidential race, is supported by 15 per cent of the primary democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the competition in the primary elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that they have decided with the candidate who will be supported.
Clinton’s supporters are more confident of their choice than supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders has won some bonuses.
Clinton holds a great advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has declined.
Her support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind her.
Clinton’s preference for democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and he and Sanders are now equal.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton beat Sanders to a double-digit number of liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in this group.
Almost half of the primary democratic voters across the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for this party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and a further 15 per cent would support it only because she was a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
It may not be surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about it.
Among those who currently do not support Clinton, the views are more controversial – only about a quarter enthusiastically would support it.
While 48 percent of primary democratic voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same thing about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked openly why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16%), then that it's the time for a woman president (13%) and that she's the best candidate (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also speak of an association linking her to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It's also called agreement on issues and chances of election.
Since the Vice-President was considering potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary democratic voters wanted him to join the race, although one third felt he should not.
When asked who they wanted to be second among party candidates, the primary Democrats are mostly called Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half say they'd choose Biden second, which is more than Sanders'.
If Biden decides not to stand for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Baiden to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of the Democratic voters saw Clinton as the best candidate to win the general elections; however, that figure had fallen from 78 per cent last month.
In this indicator, Biden is the second-largest one, but the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in answer to the question, which is most important for a candidate, the Democrat voters choose other options than the possibility of being elected.
Like last month's situation, none of the Democrat or potential candidates is an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and credible people with good leadership.
Biden of all three is the leader in honesty, and Clinton's strength in leadership.
Thirty per cent of primary democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be fair and credible, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain opinion on it.
The primary democratic voters also generally regard Clinton, Sanders and Byden as similar ideological views.
By all these standards, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Although questions about Hillary Clinton's personal mailbox and server are continuing as her Secretary-General, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and feel that this has not adversely affected their general opinion of her.
But that's a very different story for the American public at large.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided as early as March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the debate about e-mail has not affected their general view of Clinton, although 36 percent say that their opinion of it has deteriorated.
They're mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who say that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton believes that her party’s voters are honest and credible, this continues to be a problem for her among the registered voters as a whole: only 32 per cent consider it fair and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not consider Trump to be fair and credible.
Clinton and Trump, however, both have good leadership scores.
Of the six tested candidates, Byden, Carson, and Bush show the best results in honesty.
Most people see Sanders as an honest man rather than an honest man, but like Carson, many people don't think about him.
The error limit for a sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the national poll, Ben Carson was close to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson approached Donald Trump closely in the latest CBS/New York Times poll.
The two candidates won half the poll vote, leaving the rest of them looking for support under their feet.
Republican voters throughout the country continue to support Trump, whose support rate has increased from 23% in a recent CBS poll held on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27% in a Tuesday poll.
But Carson took off in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson had the support of all demographic groups, crowding Trump into a group of Republican voters with higher education.
The other candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, have turned back with Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Hackaby, and Florida Senator, Marco Rubio, together ranked third with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this recent poll is positive to minus 6 per cent, and the survey was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson's growth in the polls, showing support for 19% of the Republicans, for Trump with 32% of the support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
In response to Carson's growing support last week, Trump made several critical attacks on a former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the campaign closure in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity are charged with the death of a first-year student at Baruch College.
About two years after the death of a college student during the rite of brotherhood in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
"Pi Delta Psi brothers from Baruch New York College brutally attacked Jang "Michael" Deng during the dedication ceremony in September 2013 and failed to bring him to the hospital in time for his death," reported the police.
Officials say that a student with blindfolded eyes and a 30-pound sandbag was pushed behind his back several times while he was trying to reach his goal while walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood didn't call 911 when Deng passed out and waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, talking to the police.
They took time, however, to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the brotherhood, to ask for advice on what Chief Chris Wagner said at the press conference.
"At this point, the members of the fraternity began to hide their personal property, essentially putting the well-being of the fraternity above Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
They couldn't save him, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered some blunt injuries to his head, torso and thigh.
“Too many families have suffered as a result of the rites of brotherhood, as at least one student dies during them every year since 1970”, said Douglas Fayerberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family in his statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The Monroe County jury has opted for a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with violence against a rookie and conspiracy.
“We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has formally or informally authorized all of this, it is her,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College banned fraternity, and the national fraternity excluded the local office.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There's going to be an increase in the rates, and the bull market will trip, the bond returns will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long it will be before the offensive and how long it will continue.
Specifically for the economy, history does not explain much about time.
The recession took place only 11 months after the first rate hike and for a total of 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
So the U.S. Central Bank administration is so insistent that investors should not focus on when they start raising stakes, but on how much adaptation will take.
Indeed, there are many variables in the game.
After all, however, market participants may find that all the fuss about raising rates is exaggerated.
“The Federal Reserve’s first rate hike with the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the money era,” says Julian Jessop, the chief international economic expert in Capital Economics, in his comments to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of interest rates in the US to a more normal, but still low levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here's an overview of how some areas of the economy could react, depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, waiting for higher rates may lead to volatility for some time.
If the rate is raised, however, the consequences are usually less dramatic.
"It does not seem that the stock income will slow down 12-24 months after the first race, which again probably reflects the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes.
More specifically, the market is more likely in the last 35 years to change sharply, about 14 per cent upwards, and remains fairly flat within 250 days (average growth of 2.6 per cent), and then, after 500 days, returns to normal conditions with an average return of 14.4 per cent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the chief trade strategy expert at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends not to be more pronounced at the rate-up stage immediately, and share income is beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they are often encouraged by higher rates.
In this case, the Federal Reserve has been placed under conditions that did not exist earlier and may accelerate the recession.
Most of the gross domestic product will be at its lowest point in the lifetime of the higher rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, only twice the nominal annual GDP was under 4.5 per cent.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe that it will last long, with only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlantic Fed.
Higher rates on such a volatile economic background may be risky and raise the question of “will it be different this time”, reported Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to raise the rates of the Federal Reserve for the whole year, with their views tied to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
So far, many strategy experts and economists believe that FOMC could approve the increase at this meeting, futures trade is only a 25 per cent probability.
"In our study from 1950, all cycles of rates up to now were in a supercycle of increasing financial leverage at GDP, which overcuts peaks leading to recession very quickly after recovery," states the report.
In contrast, this was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, which has lasted 74 months and has not yet ended.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market is waiting for higher rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one sold for equity.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds, the effect will be faster than for shares when the federal system changes strategic direction.
In the case of bonds, it appears that the return changes the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond returns are dropping immediately, reports Deutsche.
Strategy experts in Charles Schwab believe that higher rates will lead to returns of long-term and short-term bonds coming closer, making the curve more flat.
High-return bonds are often better in this climate, although "we're still afraid of fluctuations in yields," says Katie Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Shwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected policy outcomes of the Federal System.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflationary expectations, there are indications that the market has been set up to look forward to a more rigid monetary policy”, she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the rate of return has increased more flat, credit fronts have increased, and volatility has increased - all market characteristics with tightened Federal system policies.
Generally speaking, companies operating their main business in the US will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International debt companies will be worse off because the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the world marketplace and their debt more expensive in financial terms.
"The story shows that `quality' shares are more effective than the market within three months of the initial increase in rates," said Goldman Sachs analysts in the client report.
Firms with stable financial conditions have been overtaken by companies with unstable conditions with each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns, as well as low volatility shares, have also shown greater efficiency than low-quality shares by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (interest points) respectively.
Duty will be a big question.
High-denominated companies with floating rates will lose most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely stock exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from a growing dollar.
Investors could also see profits through higher returns, although experts differ in how fast this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM", claims the Conservative Member Andrew Bingham.
The Conservative Member, Andrew Bingham, criticized the station for "degrading standards"
Proves it's getting less different from a commercial competitor.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award was just torn off by the Brits.
The parliamentary colleague Damien Collins, who crashed on The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 turns into Classic FM," stated the leader of Parliament, encouraging the television and radio company to prove that it was doing something that commercial companies did not.
A member of Parliament from conservatives, Andrew Bingham, also told the BBC leadership that it seemed that the public radio station was "dumping" and becoming less and less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like using the word "simplification" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else -- these are two examples that came to my mind first, in which you're actually just copying what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
Director General BBC rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience formation.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his dedication to live performances and music is not really like anyone else.
"It's also very important, I think, that Radio 3's interest in finding new music and promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davy argued that radio stations had to work much more to attract audiences than in the past, because the British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of BBC who was attacked for attacking the heels of commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
A member of Parliament from Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an indicative price of £22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because of the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in the "BBC Typical Style".
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit in her own home stable" next time she started the entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent future purchases of the Voice seasons or the use of the money of those paying the licence fee for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales grew as slow as possible in August, and it could be Black Friday.
In the first three months of 2015, there was an increase of 7 per cent in online sales
Last month, there has been the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sales intensified three years ago using mobile shopping devices
Experts are convinced that November's Black Friday could have helped contain the waste.
For about ten years, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs of levelling online sales after the latest data show only a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total cost of online shopping in August showed minimal growth since it began to be recorded in 2000, increasing by only 5 per cent.
Experts say that there are now signs of levelling online sales after the latest data show only a 7 per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to 2000, they've always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkehi, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do it under any circumstances, like sitting on a couch.
But now it's on the plateau, and you can see the decline.
The Black Friday Phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowing down of sales.
The experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying on the eve of the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers rushed to the computers to take advantage of the lucrative offers, bringing down a number of sales websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers take a real fight for lucrative purchases, could make people refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Real Consortum, a little more than £1 out of every 5 is spent online.
With regard to products such as television and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through Internet stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more readily than in fashion stores in central streets.
Muslims bury those killed in the fall of a crane in Mecca, and the Bin Laden family is being sanctioned.
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead in the streets, as the first funeral begins in Mecca.
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed Saudi Binladin Group for the accident.
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 persons were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims flowed all over the street to bury 29 of the victims who had lost their lives as a result of the collapse of the crane on the main mosque of Mecca.
Dressed mostly in white, those present at the funeral flooded the carriageway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went on their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession passed by a sacred place where only a few days earlier a building crane had broken through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parish.
The bodies were issued for burial, while the King of Saudis fined the construction company belonging to the Bin Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 parishioners killed in a crane crash at the Main Mosque were carried down the streets.
Among the dead were the father of four children, Kasim Akram, from Bolton, the Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Main Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left an arrow in the crane raised when the crane was not functioning.
The Arab version of the decree, published by Saudi Press, states that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English news agency did not mention the details, but reported that the company’s leaders were not allowed to leave the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out why the crane had fallen into the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had flown to the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the crane’s collapse, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and improper coordination with the Meteorological Service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Mecca Main Mosque, as part of the extensive construction work being carried out by the Binladin Group.
The Bin Laden family has been one of Saudi Arabia's close ruling families for decades and has been running major construction projects.
The late Al-Qaida leader, Osama bin Laden, was a traitor son whom the family disowned in the 1990s.
The accident took place with strong winds and rain just a few days before millions of people came into the kingdom to engage in pilgrimage, which is mandatory for every working Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about 174,000 pounds) to the relatives of the victims, and the same amount was irreversibly crippled.
The remaining victims will receive half of this amount.
Chapter B&Q states that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European craftsmen working for small money.
According to Veronica Lori, the British are increasingly hiring repair workers.
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores throughout the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent, Daily Mail
They say the British put hammers and paint brushes aside, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do housework.
If you know how to use a hammer or how to paint walls, you seem to be in the minority these days.
Because, according to the B&Q company, the British are still hiring masters to do simple housework.
Veronica Lori, the new director-general of Kingfisher, who runs a network of house-building services, reported that this trend is followed by a substantial influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open an additional 200 Screwfix stores specializing in craftsmen's products, while closing 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Lori said that she would like to see more women in B&Q shops, as eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store were made by women of the weak sex.
Currently, the majority of staff are men.
According to her, recent demographic trends, with an increase in the number of single-woman households that were more concerned with housing than in the past, could not be overlooked.
Ms. Lori said, "Our shops are still dominated by men.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on goods purchased are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women at the helm of the leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE 100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team to equal numbers of men and women directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with exactly 50% of managers being women, including the CEO and Financial Director.
Ms. Laurie said, "It was a deliberate decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women on the board was easy.
After the group took over the costs of closing the shops, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales in six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores.
Time to decide on the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching the Federal Reserve Bank's meeting, which discusses the most important decision within two days, whether to raise interest rates for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists by Reuters revealed that just over half of those who thought last week that the Federal Reserve would do so now believe that it would delay and keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, since it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve reduced the rate to zero.
For the first time, we approach the fact that the main bank can move from zero to start the process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, a leading member of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The US economy works efficiently, the recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore the impact of the decision on the world economy.
He warned markets that they should be prepared for change, but they were convinced that all chances were against it.
The decision will be announced at 8:00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees to the EU via Croatia.
"Open!" hundreds of refugees are chanting at the Khorgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border for the displaced.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to explore other routes to the European Union.
One of them lies across the closed border with Serbia through Romania.
The other through Croatia and Slovenia to Austria.
According to some reports, the buses that transported the refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading towards the town of Shidu on the Croatian border.
Drivers were instructed by the authorities to follow without stopping.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior, Nebojša Stepanović, assures us that his country is doing its best to help the refugees, but its capacity is limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to be treated humanely.
But that's already a pan-European problem.
It is difficult to resolve, and no country in Europe alone can do it, much less a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian Premier Victor Orban is unfailing:
If a refugee is to be identified, in Serbia he or she must complete the documents necessary to do so.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed into our country either, because it's safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already built a 175-tiklometer fence on the border with Serbia.
Orban does not intend to stop at this point; he plans to erect the same barrier on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
==History==Vangelis Meimarakis has been a member of the law-centric government for several years, leading to a financial crisis in the left.
Now, as a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, he challenges Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist, Euronews.
Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by giving way to the SIRISA coalition, but now, according to polls, New Democracy is as popular as it is.
What has changed in that time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
The country is now again facing fiscal deficits and high unemployment rates.
The investors have gone because Mr. Tsipras has banished them.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had an opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what they promised with what really happened.
Day - to - day life was markedly worse than in January, when the situation improved, with the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SIRIS.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The fact is that, as we have learned in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in place, political forces and all ruling parties have come together to implement a programme under which they have reached agreement without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If you become the new premiere on Monday, will you comply with this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece’s movement along the European path, because we are well aware of the disastrous consequences that a country’s withdrawal from the EU would have.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, Junker's package, and banking assistance.
All of this would have been lost if there had not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr. Tsipras negotiating.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government wants to bring order to power in the first year, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all the commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of what leads to the recession can be negotiated again, but only after some time.
It would be wrong to believe that, already in the first year of the new agreement, we would be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they await full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their trust, we must continue to privatize, reform and structural changes that have been agreed upon, while continuing to benefit from EU financing and the greater investment opportunities that we must open for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras Government did not present any serious arguments on many of the key political issues that we have learned by discussing these issues with our European counterparts.
I can give you an example of farmers' incomes.
We explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that ministers of Tsipras never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were unprepared and poorly informed, and thus failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table with Mr. Junker, Holland, Ms. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them differ from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that before the end of 2014, we were trying to best implement the 2012 agreement by by bypassing the sharp corners of it.
We have advanced reform.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extreme circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price that the Greek government offered.
I was the Speaker of Parliament at the time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that constituted the government majority at the time.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a functioning parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations outside.
We have managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would have continued to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections that resulted from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: In recent weeks there has been a massive influx of refugees across Greece.
What do you think of this situation and the reactions of the European countries to which these people aspire?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we have to deal with after winning the election.
The reason is that the SIRISA Government did not act in the way it should.
In such matters, action should be taken ahead of you, because if the problem hits you, only emergency measures remain.
And that's what we're in now.
Even the interim government that replaced SIRIZA did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the interim Government, which has received valuable assistance from the President of the Republic, who called for an EU summit, will help to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and notice that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that happened to them.
There is a profound humanitarian dimension to this issue, and we will adhere to the position that European politicians must adopt in this new situation.
The decision must be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations must be involved.
We also need better coordination, better border control and reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU to be able to deal with this pressing problem.
Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Thank you.
In the peaceful town of Buddykovka Donetsk oblast, for 24 hours, the criminal investigation officers of the General Police Department of the region, together with the military counter-intelligence, identified and detained a suspect who was found to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the town of Krivoy Rog (Dnepropetrov oblast), who was in the evening of the joint drinks and the conflict in the village of Upper-Torocek Yasinowatsk district of Donetchina fired a machine gun at his opponent.
A 22-year-old boy was reported injured from a hospital where he was hospitalized with cross-fired legs.
According to Artem Vasitsky, Deputy Head of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Police Chief of the Region, during the course of the operational activities, the law enforcement officers proved that the figure had been involved in another serious criminal offence, the killing of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The operatives found that the same day there was a conflict between the suspect and another local resident, resulting in a fatal gunshot wound to the man's head.
The Investigative Department of the Office of the Deputy Prosecutor has opened criminal proceedings under the articles “Intentional murder” and “Intentional serious bodily harm” of the Ukrainian Criminal Code.
The detainee faces up to 15 years ' imprisonment.
The figure was detained and placed in a temporary detention cell and reported to the Donetsk police service.

Two other residents of the city were sentenced to restriction of liberty.
Novosibirsk residents have been sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicts received a restriction of liberty for 14 and 18 months.
The Leninsk Court of Novosibirsk found four citizens guilty of vandalism against the monuments of Lenin, which were located on the territory of the CPRC and on the Trikotaj Street, as well as the memorial complex of the Monument of Slava.

The civilian wife of the popular Russian actor Yevgeny Zyganov Irina Leonov gave birth to a seventh child.
The girl was born in one of the Moscow clinics.
The newborn and her mother are feeling well.
Let's remind you, Gypsies and Leonov recently broke up.
Eugenius refuses to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambition.
Eugenia Zyganov is 36 years old.
He's an actor at the Moscow Theatre of Petra Fomenco.
It's famous for the movies "The Walk", "Cosmos As a Premonition", "The Brest Fortress", "Ottel" and "The Farza".
On September 8, Yevgeny Zyganov was recognized as the "Acté of the Year" and the "Man of the Year" in the Russian version of the popular GQ magazine.
The man who opened the shooting at Delta State University left a note of apology.
After shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning, and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying that he "repent" about the first murder and wanted "all back," the authorities informed on Tuesday.
Police in Gotier, Mississippi, reports that a professor of geography and social science at Delta State University called 911 around 10:00 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his house.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there's a dog in the house that's "no one to touch," but probably upset.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but he didn't call him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the shooting.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41 years old, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45 years old, saying, "I'm sorry to return everything.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on the night of Monday, when he was surrounded by the police, he killed himself.
University Rector William Laforge reported that he had no knowledge of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb was clearly on his mind."
Despite information received on Monday that Lamb was supposed to have an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services reported on Tuesday that there was “no information or evidence” of a “loving triangle”.
Prentiss was referred to as a "good man" by Sean O'Stin, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Stin told me that he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19, and that she was "consoled."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom the Sun Herald newspaper calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home online.
Knowles told me that Prentiss had a hunting dog called Lightning, and that she was dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his family on Monday at some point to say "he's not going to jail."
On the night of the same day, when the police caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself.
According to a summary posted on a university website, Lamb received a PhD degree in pedagogical science at the University of Delta in spring 2015.
Stars Losing their Happiness
The actor (left), in a photograph with his son Redmond (right), has experienced several difficult years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his long-standing life companion, Farrah Fosette, who died of cancer.
The actor also reportedly suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United got out for a few months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a championship league match in which Manchester United lost PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is concerned about this, which will prevent him from entering the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The trauma occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless assault at the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into PSV.
He was treated in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's got a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be moved to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then he'll be operated on.
It's terrible - a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, and he's overcome a lot of trouble and he's played fantastic, and that's when it happened.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's six months, and the guy won't be able to play the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno's lucky he didn't get the red card and he didn't get the penalty.
The Arbitrator, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
You judge yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad two-legged ride.
In his tweet, Shaw says, "Thank you all for your messages, not to describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I will return even more than I was."
On the other hand, Manchester United is experiencing Luke Shaw's misfortune in losing the PSV game.
The British defender will have an additional incentive to recover to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Coke, Coach PSV, said, "This is a very serious injury."
When any player gets out with this kind of trauma, everyone's very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to traumatize the enemy.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team, led by Van Gal at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him right now, because he had no intention of hurting the enemy, and when you hear that it's a very serious injury, you feel bad," said Koku.
I couldn't see the moment myself.
The only thing I could see was a ball that flew in the other direction, so it looked like it (Moreno) touched it, but I didn't see a pod for Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to endure.
It's very hard, and I'm sorry.
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about the Laraxe?
Every parent quickly learns one thing: if your child likes a book, it's gonna take a little while before you get to know it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron, I suppose.
In response to a question from a representative of a holiday holiday company about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose Laraxe, an environmental story written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, and Cameron wrote in a comment published on the SuperCamps website, and he goes on to say, "This is a fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my children because it always reveals some kind of image or message we miss."
And everything would be fine, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to rewrite the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of the same-name film, made in 2012, with new characters and details added to make a rather short original story.
"In the high walls of the town of Thundernugville, where there was no green and even no air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart, the girls of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," we read in the text a description of the love story unknown to Dr. Seuss (the real name is Theodore Suse Gazelle), who died in 1991.
If it doesn't seem suspicious enough, Cameron's text is read almost as a summary of the film's Loraks, posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high wall town of Thundernugville, where everything was artificial and even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart, the girls of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, who is admittedly an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy learns about how a greedy tree cutter and the Necessary Hardkins wrestler destroys the environment, despite the protests of Loraks (whose name is in the title of the book), a funny creature with a moustache that "speaks on behalf of the trees".
It is likely that such a simple PR task was entrusted to an artist who never read a book about Lorax 20 times in a row.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text was allegedly received from Cameron's office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments were received.
Adam Lit was clearly at risk of not joining England, but it's still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England chose for this tour, it's not likely that the 3-0 test series that happened last time was repeated.
I wouldn't rule out winning my field either.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are players who are virtually taking twisted balls, and collective thinking strongly; they will not bring scars from 2012, but only youthful positive.
With Moin Ali's ball, he turns into a bowler with a twisted ball, and Adil Rashid, even if he's an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
On the other hand, Adam Lit retired from England's test cricket team and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to expel Adam Lit to me, his chief coach at Yorkshire, is certainly difficult to analyse.
His seven test matches had two good attacks under difficult circumstances, and the obvious but violent reality is that cricket players are judged by the judges on the outcome.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I have said so before) players choose themselves best.
A couple of semi-tones, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there'll be another opportunity.
The head coach of the England team, Trevor Baileys, spoke well about his mood, even when he didn't show what he could do, and that doesn't surprise me; he's first of all a team player, and then everything else.
The question is how long it's gonna take before the test cricket batsman leaves an impression on him is a complicated question.
Lit played seven games, just like Sam Robson did before him, and Nick Compton played nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on another man's field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lit was in the best shape, but this lost opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales shows up, and he's the Batsman I appreciate.
He's a unpredictable cricketist, which we saw at the Yorkshire Club earlier this season, when he earned 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those before him, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea of putting Moan next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would allow for the introduction of an additional spinner, keeping four speed bowlers, is thinking about it, and I'm not against it at all.
I don't see why a batterer can't hit the ball there, and this left-handed guy already showed that he's a hell of a cricket player.
Moan may not be exactly what he needs for his Woostershire County, but he's become the third number for them, and there's no big difference.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test matches with the third batsman before he was released as opening in 2001.
He won 300 at once and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a back-up spinner, and in my brief conversation with him, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his model statistics -- on average, 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball -- and think it's a risky bet, but there's a few of the spinners who vote for it, and those who choose to be young.
He'll learn a lot about this tour.
In addition to the team, England plans to make a few practical additions to the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardin, a Sri Lankan Batsman, as a consultant for test matches could be a master's move.
He's one of the best guys for a game that's gonna bring in the wealthiest experience that's ever been gained under all possible conditions and any kind of attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games where the white ball is used and will provide both energy and merciless speed in the set.
I've always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it's a game or a coaching job, and like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what was said earlier, can give new strength to the team.
Collie's teammate Durham Ben Stokes is left for a day, Ruth is given a similar break for Australia, and for example, I have no problem with it.
Although not everyone will agree, coaches and players don't determine the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The UK exit camp can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's ill-conceived policy of resuming negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU is becoming increasingly difficult every day, even without looking back at the selection of the genius Jeremy-"Is it true or not?"- Corbin's Labour leader or TUC's resentment about Europe on Tuesday.
Aliens also have their own Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that, under the current EU situation, a multiplicity of crises -- not all of them their own -- some of the member countries were fed up with the British self-centric agenda of sifting concessions and undermining arrangements for changes that they largely did not want.
Having met in Brighton for an annual meeting, TUC decided that he didn't want them anyway if they were destroying social protection.
We could even call it a selfie program for Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and Minister of Finance ride at summit and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the background of a famous local monument, a company of local celebrities, or without it, then come home and say that they bring allies to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be interested in maintaining British external contacts under the EU Tent - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - proposes that the noisy ministers and officials in some capitals reach an understanding when they don't care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the very cautious Chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation worsens for her, how she deteriorated for the 11-year-old Thatcher, Mitterrand (14) and Kola (16).
France's head François Hollande stands before re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland may soon receive a right-wing nationalist government, Spain's left-hand government.
It's hard to see them coming out of their skins to help the selphi-brits whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK -- which they don't want, too, because most people have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan to issue deliberately useless SNP-style remixes during the British referendum campaign in 2017 to boost Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, my friend suggests.
"Revision was an idea-fix" and "British has received nothing valuable from the resumed negotiations."
Europeans know what kind of predator Fleet Street can be, and how sceptical media-magnets are toward the EU, unlike Tony Ben's referendum in 1975, which supported our entry into 1973 by a ratio of 2:1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, a hardened Euro-opportunist, famous for his “direct EU bananas” by a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In spite of his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a small company of tax- fearing cheaters, foreign phone hackers and pseudo-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair felt the same way about them, but he realized that when you're in a cell with a violent gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her and stop her from eating you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was more committed to Blair than Blair himself to opposing Cameron’s idea of a referendum, because Blair acted in favour of the abrogated EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him any of this.
But the mile Jeremy Corbin, who was friendly with me in Westminster on Monday -- I told him he didn't have time to waste it on me -- seems to risk repeating Neil Kinnock's strategy "Bocott Murdock" from the '80s -- a mistake both then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy to interact with the press, not with me, but definitely with Andrew Marr, on whose Air Force couch he was sitting on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside of the traditional Ukip trend and the wider range of “small England” tories may say yes to that.
It's the same thing as Hilary-Benn, but not Bennit-Benn said on radio and TV this week, and his inner boy scout refused to admit that Corbin's appointment of the infamous John McDonnell as the shadow minister of finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his father-father fought hard on TV for being disloyal to colleagues in the Labour Cabinet without going too far or losing his position in the Cabinet.
Hilary's battle was more appealing.
But the struggle to stay "in all circumstances" -- Benn's phrase -- is not what McDonnell said, or what J.K. said to the Perams and Members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, in general opinion.
Whatever the Democrat and "his boyfriend" Corbin wanted to tell me -- remember, he touched even me -- the discipline of messages remains important in the 24-hour television age seven days a week, especially in the whirlwind of social networks, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It's wise to keep Cameron from getting rid of Europe so easily, allowing him to accept as appropriate the support of Labourists during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbin's main misconception about EU membership - within the Bennite economy of besieged fortress - is no longer a question of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for whom narcissism, born of little distinction, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his misconceptions about Nato - Tom Watson, it is unrelenting that J.K. will not be able to appeal for his exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey this to their leaders at their home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital -- they also have suspicious voters -- on British concessions when it could be meaningless?
The US is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tory Government is in power to cut the costs, as I was reminded on Monday at lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
The government-funded agency claimed that cigarettes were 95 per cent less harmful than smoking, and 12 people, some of whom were related to the tobacco industry, were reported by researchers.
Experts published in British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published an important report, the turning point last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of evidence."
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the relationship of some experts to the tobacco industry.
The editorial in Lancet's medical journal last month criticized the “extremely shaky argument” on which PHE built its main opinion.
In article BMJ, two other researchers questioned whether these statements were “hard or frustrating”.
Martin McKee, a professor of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, reported: “The fundamental principle of health care - rules must be based on evidence of effectiveness”.
They said that the public expected PGE statements that “the current best estimate indicates that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco smoking” were based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this emerges from the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a model for multicriteria analysis of decision-making in order to synthesize their views on harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKey and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also confirmed BAT health certificates in the sustainable development report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer without mentioning the funding that he reportedly previously received from the Philip Morris tobacco company.
No reasonable explanation has been provided for the selection of board members, but there are several known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of whom have also announced funding for the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether the other participants in the meeting have the experience of managing the tobacco business.
The head of the tobacco department in PHE also visited the meeting.
The scientific article published by the group “simply agrees” that there is a lack of “hard evidence of the harmful effects of most products according to most criteria”, wrote McKey and Capewell.
However, none of these links and restrictions were addressed in the PHE report.
McKey and Capewell said that PHE statements that “there is currently no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smoking” were premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the PHE health and well-being course, explained that BMJ applications had previously been answered.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two smokers died of his addiction all his life.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote consequences.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public of what this evidence proves and does not prove, especially where the public has doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people per year die from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs NHS 2 billion pounds per year.
Clearly, while electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only cause part of the harm caused by smoking - we do our tasks to the nation.
Former head of Channel 4 believes that BBC should stop the EastEnders series.
Former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop producing programs like EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would have paid a lot for such successful shows as the soap opera on Albert Square.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should only be used to create programs that are not produced by other British radio companies.
He criticized BBC for putting public broadcasts, which are probably only a small part of the audience, on peak airtimes when competitors are performing a high-rated show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson observed that he had tried unsuccessfully to cooperate with BBC for six years while working at Channel 4.
"I can't help but think that BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting programmes that could be shown by competing companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told the members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of the BBC's future.
If you keep the licence fee, which I don't think is a good medium- and long-term solution, then companies should only keep on the air those programs that are not produced and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice show is aired on the prime chair because creators want the best possible support for the future.
The idea of no one else showing it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to finance transfers that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, the EastEnders is the other; they are known to be their own production.
Other channels would certainly have paid a lot for it.
I don't understand how this can be public broadcasting.
I don't think that would've lowered the BBC.
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of pursuing ratings "for the ambitions of employees and for their belief that this is the best way to get support for a long time."
His comments on BBC's most popular show were those of Sky Executive Director Tony Ball, who in his McTaggart Memorial Lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 offered BBC to sell series like EastEnders.
Johnson observed that the more unfavorable public BBC broadcasts “continue to go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate audiences, but the function of the company has been performed, and this can be presented as an argument in the practitioner's sermons justifying 4 billion pounds of royalties: "Well, of course, we do all these incomprehensible broadcasts that no one is watching."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
With regard to the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I encourage you to find a more regressive system as to who gets the most from it.
Of course, you all think we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people who have 150 pounds a lot of money, I wonder, they think that's because they don't really watch and listen to BBC.
Former executive director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, David Elstein, who also addressed the committee last Tuesday, said that the BBC should review Rita's mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He noted that only a small fraction of BBC production was now formally classified as educational - he said it was 1% of television content and 0.1% on radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto “inform, educate and entertain”.
On partnership issues, Elstein noted that BBC should do more in such areas as Promenade Concerts (only a few of them he says are on TV) and join alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available online.
Soogenetics allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves.
The video shows how the nematodes change direction when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have extracted worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change their direction at a time when they are affected by sound impulses, too high for the human ear to hear them.
Impulses are influenced by activation of neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
On the subject: Researchers manage brain activity with light
Scientists said that worms were demonstrating the potential of a new technique called “sonogenetics”, the essence of which was to use ultrasound to excite certain brain, heart and muscle cells, with the source of ultrasound being located outside the body.
Srikant Chalasani, a researcher at Solka Institute, La Hoya, California, told Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure whereby electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Nematod worms usually don't react to ultrasound, but Chalasani discovered that they started to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles reinforced ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves affect structures called the "ion channels TRP-4" found in the membrane of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and inflame the cells that are connected to them, as reported in the Nature Communications report.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani has made genetic changes to worms, so their motor neurons used ion channels TRP-4.
During the application of ultrasound to modified organisms, sound waves were reinforced with microscopic bubbles and injected into worms by activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to that used in "optogenetic" - a new direction that allows scientists to switch on and off neurons with light pulses.
Chalasani argues that there may be some advantages in relation to this method of sauguinetics.
Unlike the light delivered to the right section of the brain by fibre optics, low - frequency ultrasonic waves flow freely through the body’s tissue, so they do not need to be delivered inside the skull box.
"We believe that in order to treat some neurological diseases in clinical settings, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will temporarily make human neurons sensitive to ultrasound signals," said Chalasani.
He added that, in addition, the methodology could be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment right on your doorstep!
Advertisements mocked the British arms trade
Look at Amnesty International with a protest against the arms exhibition.
Fantastic killer drones!
Destroying iron shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light-noise truncheons causing unbearable pain, but leaving no traces!
There is no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international arms exhibition, prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British government's intention to push weapons to repressive regimes by using an exhibition of defence technology and security systems at the center of ExCeL in Dockland.
Another topic: DSEI Arms Exhibition: Authoritarian Regimes Going to London
But a special campaign has also led to the sudden emergence of many posters at bus stops and on subway trains, which require another look at them.
"The important announcement on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them in the London subway fonts with the image of the DLR line turning into a tank silhouette.
In September this year, a crowd of arms dealers will enter the DLR line. Passengers are being asked to help prevent the arms exhibition.
300 posters are painted by artists who exhibited their works at the "Museum of Cruel Design" in Banksy Park "Dismaland".
A collective called Special Patrol has helped to spread them around London by using a “advertiser set”, a six-pound set of gadget keys, which is said to “provide access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stops on the planet”.
London transporters are not happy with this "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the spotlights issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Greendon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and teacher at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and eager to communicate political art to audiences outside the gallery.
Many artists are starting to work with protest activists, realizing that they have to go to the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against an arms exhibition welcoming passengers on the subway.
An Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by a pro bono VCCP with a graphic designer and an artist who also works free of charge.
The creative director of VCCP, Matt Lever, was struck by the advertising silence surrounding the arms exhibition -- with an ExCel pass -- and thought, "Let's get them a campaign that they're trying to avoid."
They thought of creating more realistic and clever corporate advertising, but "filling it at home with bright flowers and animation was more exciting."
"They've been incredibly helpful in drawing attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take measures and guarantee that this torture equipment will not be sold illegally at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art of the arms exhibition comes from inside ExCeL, where participants trade fantastic euphemic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order for "AT4CS RS to shoot off the shoulder" from the U.S. Army.
It includes “no analogous cumulative weaponry that produces an insurmountable armoured action inside the target”.
Whatever he does, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules of residence in student dormitories
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student dorm as a normal 19-year-old who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I irritated -- and many, many long complaints about others.
Basically, what I've learned can be broken down by eight simple rules.
Moving to a dorm can vary from a little nerve to a totally scary place.
He makes people talk about where you came from, where you took your academic vacation and where you spent it, whether you supported Corbin, and why you're "honestly, not loving, not hating Marmite," because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract from HAHA, I'll be there."
Take a break.
And help others take a break too, ask questions and show interest.
It keeps you talking and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and they would give out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms are often turned into drinking facilities, midnight cinemas, and common places, but they are also the place where people dress and fix their underwear.
On the other hand, don't even think about starting university when you're in a relationship.
Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room should be a shelter, but many dormitories form a culture of dilapidation from one room to another, which fosters friendship, communication, and long friendships.
It could be hell for someone who's trying to regain strength.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I can restore the energy I've used to communicate with you."
Try to feel like a fellow student is tired of communicating, not knocking on him, but sending a text.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dorm was following this principle: If the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Make friends with baking.
Since you're starting university life at the peak of the Bake-Off show, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate cookies is not that strange, it's not like the 1950s with their "Welcome, we're neighbors, I made you something, and now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to be friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and eventually your face will probably be associated with their pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Badly blinded piles of flour, sugar, and fat will make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Stealing food is a typical crime in student dorms.
Of course, embezzling someone's chicken is stealing, but is it stealing to take a little milk for tea?
You can handle the milk owner.
He'll probably ask you not to be shy, even if it's hot inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I'm sorry for you, but try to take this older than my neighbor, who poured dishwashing fluid in her milk to get revenge on those who took it without asking.
She's in prison now.
You don't have to make noises that will keep people from sleeping or learning.
Not just to be a decent man, but also because you're the people of the glass houses saying.
The girl in my hallway asked the neighbor to slow down the drum and bass guitar because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5:00 a.m., she kindly let him sleep for two hours, and then she turned on her music and locked the door behind him, leaving for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband lived in the same dorm as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extreme, before you bite elbows, clumsy if you took your roommate for your future husband, got involved with him, broke up a relationship and had to see him every day, and maybe watch him drag all your mutual friends to his side?
Of course, you can't tell the heart, but if a hot neighbor is definitely not your future husband, try to cool your own heat a little.
At that exciting moment, when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between prank and harassment is thinner than it looks.
A good prank is fun, but it turns into its opposite in seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never get someone's room dirty with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the other guy's door and put the keys in a glass of water that you'll put in the freezer-- but don't glue other people's stuff to the ceiling more than two times.
iOS 9: How to install a new operating system on the iPhone after the Apple update
You can request a new operating system by entering the Settings application to select General and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to download it and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation when an error report appears telling them that “Renewing the application failed”.
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the revitalisation has subsided or try to update via iTunes.
The tips on the phone will allow you to complete the process.
The process may include removing applications to increase space - but Apple minimized the probability of this action by reducing the amount of update, and also simplified execution with a special tool that proposes to remove applications and re-insert them after the process is completed.
It is worth making sure that your phone is loaded or close to the charger in order to prevent the battery from being defused.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop updating, as decommissioning of the phone during the process may result in a failure of the update.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support provided by Moscow to President Assad only served to exacerbate the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk to a Russian colleague about it, writing PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russian military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's continued support for President Assad poses a risk of exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, as well as adversely affecting our common goal of combating extremism, unless we also continue to focus on finding a solution to the Syrian conflict through the direct transfer of power”, representatives of the US State Department stated.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the US's commitment to fighting the Islamic State in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad would never be a member.
In addition, the US “will welcome Russia's constructive role in trying to counter the Islamic State.”
Last Friday, representatives of the White House said that they did not know exactly what the Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the matter with Moscow.
However, White House Press Secretary Josh Ernest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet arrived: "When the President decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will be in our interest, then he will pick up the phone and try to make this call."
Barack Obama himself considers Russia’s decision to increase support for Assad’s regime as a “lost bet.”
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that it was a mistake, that Assad’s continued support would only worsen the situation.
"But he did not heed my warnings, and as a result the situation deteriorated," said the President of the United States.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating facilities for recreation and sport from customs duties and taxes.
Changes to the list of temporary duty-free goods have been prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elena Lashkin, reported this to Izvestiya.
In June 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of the Russian Federation, following his visit to Crimea, commissioned a number of agencies - Minróndevelopment, Minranza RF, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of the Russian Federation, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of the Russian Federation, Ministry of the Russian Federation, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Russian Federation of Foreign Affairs - to prepare proposals on the creation of the environment for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
The owners prefer to keep their ships abroad, with about €200 million going to the treasury of European States every year for maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission “On the amendment of the list of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from the payment of customs duties and taxes”, which provides for the granting of full conditional exemption from the payment of customs duties, taxes on yachts and other floating facilities for recreation and sport.
In the view of the Ministry, this would certainly contribute to creating an enabling environment for the development of yachting in the country ' s coastal zones, noted Lashkin.
The issue was presented to the Subcommission on Customs, Tariff, Non-Tariff Regulation, Protection Measures in Foreign Trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also endorsed by the agencies as a result of the discussion.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure of full conditional release on importation is essentially a benefit.
Therefore, following the adoption of the minutes of the meeting of the Subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EEEC member States, explaining Lashkin.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary for the promotion of foreign economic activities and international cooperation, for use in science, culture, cinema, sports and tourism, for international assistance, etc. These include service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), monitors, drilling equipment, stage costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and religious objects.
The Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, Izvedien, reported that mandatory regulations had been issued on the seaports of Kerci, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatory, which provided for a simplified procedure for the entry and exit of small, sporting sailing and pleasure craft into the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has been instructed to ensure that the captains of the Crimea seaports are able to facilitate the entry of small, sporting sailing and pleasure craft at the seaport and the departure of the listed vessels from the seaport.
Mintransom has also prepared draft regulations of the Government of the Russian Federation for the approval of the border areas of the seaports of Crimea.
In the case of Yalta and Feodosia, orders have already been issued, and others are in the process of being negotiated, as noted in the press service of the Department.
According to Mintrans, the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol are required to register and register for small craft used for non-commercial purposes.
The problem is that in Russia, yachting is extremely difficult precisely because of poor infrastructure.
If you look at southern Italy and France, it's a whole ever-growing industry that involves a large number of people.
In Russia, however, everything actually stands still.
Our coastline is not interesting, the only piece that can be exploited year round is the Black Sea in Sochi, Gelenjik, Novorossi, Anapa.
But the great difficulty is that the border guard rules are very strict in this area: to walk on a yacht, a lot of permits have to be issued.
Besides, there's no place to refuel inside Russia.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then there's a problem where to get it, says the sales director of Nordmarine Denise Novikov.
With regard to yacht storage sites, there are now special boat hangars in Moscow and St. Petersburg for up to 30 metres. Yachts are also sent to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany for storage.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers were rich people, but with the start of the crisis, the demand for yachts declined.
The World Bank has provided Ukraine with a $500 million loan.
The World Bank has approved a new $500 million loan project for Ukraine to develop the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
“New financing will support a number of priority measures to implement reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine”, states the communication.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Chimao Fang, said that reforms in the banking sector would help to revive credit in the real economy and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and that the World Bank was witnessing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
The Polish government had previously approved a loan to the Y100 million Ukraine, transmitting the RIA News.
Prisons ask for separate units for transgenders.
The Public Council of the Federal Service for the Execution of Sentences (FSIN) for the Protection of the Rights of Sentenced Persons in October 2015 will discuss, among other issues, the possibility of establishing separate units in colonies for transgender and transvestite persons.
Councilman Vladislav Grib told the news about this.
In his view, depending on the total number of non-sex offenders in Russia, it was possible to establish separate cells, blocks or even (if there were many) in domestic prisons in the future to establish a special colony for transgender persons.
However, Vladislav Greeb emphasizes that it is only possible to determine the sentence of citizens to be served in such isolated places after the convicted persons have undergone appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the offender is indeed a person identifying himself as a member of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice had been successful abroad: SIZO (where the accused were pre-trial) had separate cells for transgender persons and correctional facilities had special units.
Today, it's the only way to work with such criminals.
They clearly need to be isolated because the presence of transvestites and transgenders in ordinary cells is dangerous to them, suffering for their families and a sea of trouble for FSIN staff.
The humiliation of the trances on the side of the cellmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on the size of the city, the number of indeterminate sex offenders, we have to figure out where to distribute them.
There's no need for separate cells - only cells, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgenders.
As Gryb explained, the unit could contain 50 or 100 persons, and if a specialized corps was established in Russia alone, transgender prisoners could go there from any region to serve their sentences.
Citizens are held in the SIZO at the place where the crime was committed, so the arrival of transvestites or transgenders from other subjects during the investigation and trial is not feasible, but the introduction of such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, the Gryb believes.
We recall that the day before, law enforcement officials were unable to determine which detention facility, male or female, had been held for possession of drugs by 24-year-old transgender Dmitri Kojukov (known as Aline Davis), which had resulted in the non-arrest of a man with a girl's appearance.
He was released home on a non-exit subscription.
This news has been widely discussed in social media and media, as transgender mechanisms in the SIZO and colonies in Russia do not yet exist.
The Russian human rights defender, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alexeyev supported the idea of creating special places for transgender prisoners to serve their sentences, noting that it was also possible to identify persons in a colony - male or female - abroad depending on their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is correct.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, just like the issue of prison security for homosexuals, says Alexeyev.
Prisons must be safe, so separate blocs could be made in the name and for homosexuals, especially since there are more in prisons than transgenders.
However, Alexeyev doubtes that there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to pretend to be transexuals in order to enter a different colony.
Of course, you can introduce a medical examination before you put people in a transgender colony, but it's not always clear.
In the United States, for example, one of Chelsea Manning's prisoners looked like a man, and already in prison, he said he wanted to change sex, he said to Alexeyev.
A person can feel like anything.
But as long as there are no separate places to serve sentences for transgender people, I doubt that prison officers will think seriously about the safety of such people and understand the subtleties of their orientation or their sexual identity.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transgender offenders in a colony could significantly delay the commencement of serving sentences for convicted persons.
A commission is being set up - it's a sex science issue, psychiatrists are conducting long-term observations, it's not one test on which a very accurate conclusion is made.
Today's possibilities of psychiatry allow it.
So, even before the sex change, potential patients are always subjected to such tests -- they clearly show whether sex change with surgical intervention is the necessary measure,” says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how this system could be implemented in relation to convicts, since it takes on average a month to undergo such an examination.
Although the idea of creating separate units for transsexuals was generally supported by the doctor, he also doubted whether it would be appropriate to allocate funds in the current economic environment for new facilities, medical examinations, transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate that there are no official statistics, but given that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, it can be said that there are even fewer transgenders, and that those who have such deviations and commit crimes are very few, says Lordkipanidze.
At the moment, homosexuals, transgender persons can already obtain separate conditions of detention at the request of the administration of the colony.
Mikhail Antipov won the Junior World chess Championship.
The World chess championship for young people until the age of 20 was completed in Hunte Mansisk.
The end of the first race was more than intriguing.
The winner only decided on the final tour, and he became the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who was finally able to catch up with the Pole Jan-Kishistof Doudoo, who seemed confidently on his way to the title.
The girls were celebrated by the Ukrainian chess player Natalia Bux.
The World chess Championship, held in Hunte Mansisk since early September, seemed to have lost almost all of its intrigue by the middle of the tournament, as the Polish representative Jan-Kshištof Douda, who had awarded a series of four victories (the competitions were held on the Swiss system in 13 rounds), was firmly taking over leadership.
Given that Douda was the top-favorite rating, and is generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he would miss the break was very low.
And even when Douda slowed down and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the backlog to only 0.5, he remained the obvious favorite in the title struggle.
Because Antipov had to win the 13th round to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help if you won Dood your party.
Plus, this binding victory, of course, could have affected the Russian chess player's game and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov was able to avoid them.
He was confident in dealing with Francesco Rambaldi, and then had to wait for his party to complete Douda, who met Benjamin Bok.
Luckily for Antipov, a Polish chess player converged a confrontation with a Dutch man.
So Antipov and Douda scored 10 out of 13 possible points, but Antipov had the best additional scores.
That is why it is to him that the leadership of the Huntia-Mansian Autonomous District, whose Governor, Natalia Komarov, has traditionally placed great emphasis on the development of chess in the region, has awarded a major prize.
But there was no intriguing ending in the girls' competitions.
The leader of the tournament, Natalia Buxe (Ukraine), was sufficient to win the title not to lose in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of the Russians, Alina Bivol, prevented her from catching up with Bux.
The Russian athlete remained the second with 0.5 points behind the championship.
The ashes change the regional structure.
The company brings together the Privaj and Ural regions into one large Wallsko-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East region in the East region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
According to the CEO of Wimpelcoma, Mikhail Slobodin, the changes are being made to “main a strong player in the market”, to develop the company “in a new, not always favourable external environment”.
In an interview with "Russia 24", Mr. Slobodin explained that they intended to reduce “ten percent” of the staff in Russia.
Rospresnadzor checked 78 Moscow Burger King snacks and issued 367 orders.
As a result, the restaurant on the Volocolam Highway was fined 50,000 roubles, and the restaurant on the Grand Tull Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after all the violations had been resolved.
43 diners violated the accommodation requirements.

Igor Artemiev, head of the FAS, stated that the agency was opposed to the indexation of 10 per cent of freight tariffs and State subsidies, as requested by the OAO of the RZD.
First they wanted 17% of indexation, now they want 10%, and also multi-billion dollar subsidies from the budget, he says.
We say it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, abandon expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS has its own, “more stringent” proposals, which are currently being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net calculation with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of a $300 million worth of equities, a gold mining company reported.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the price of the Soumeru shares and market quotations) that can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to execute the option or to request additional payments.
The details of the Polymetal talks do not reveal.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of the Polimetal Project Kyzyl in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stassin, director of the Housing Policy Department of the Ministry of the Interior, reported that the Ministry, together with the BC, was developing a policy for the rehabilitation of developers.
“We understand that it's not going anywhere, so we're developing an appropriate mechanism,” said the official.
The drafts of the "Citizen Kane" movie will be tendered.
The representatives of the Profiles in History auction house reported on plans to tender the screenplays of the film "Citizen Kane", which is considered one of the best works of director, writer and actor Orson Wells.
The auction will start in the city of Calabas on September 29, presenting three draft versions of the script, each at an estimated cost of $20,000 to $30,000, and handing over AP.
The first of the drafts, written in 1940 by Herman Mankevich, is the earliest scenario in private collections?
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, and the third is the final design of the film.
Minprompt: Targeted food aid will not be the same as the USSR cards.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Evtukhov, reported that the targeted food aid programme would not be the equivalent of the USSR food distribution card system.
These include modern targeted food assistance to the population and support for an effective domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the word "food card."
It should be noted in particular that the proposed product maps should not be confused with a reflection of past total deficits, a card distribution system in which the quantity of products received is normal.
For the time being, we have proposed a concept, if approved, we will propose changes to the law,” the TASS quotes Mr. Eutukhov.
Previously, OS wrote that the food card program for the poor has been introduced into the government.
For more information on the Minprompromprogue initiative, see "OJ" for "Igor Shuwalov has commissioned the preparation of food cards".
The president of Rosgosstraha wants to divorce his wife.
The source informed RAPSI that the president of Rosgosstrach's insurance company, Danil Hachatururov, had filed a case with the Moscow Court for the dissolution of the marriage with the designer Uljana Sergienko.
The trial will commence on 16 September at the justices of the peace.
Danil Hachatururov is asking for the dissolution of his marriage and the sharing of property.
The court confirmed that there was a case for divorce in the proceedings, noting that the division of property had not been filed and would be heard by the District Court.
President Alexander Bobreshov of the RZZZ resigns.
Alexander Bobreshov, Vice President of the UAO, Russian Railways (RZD) for Corporate Security, leaves the company, reports Interfax, citing the source.
The Vice-Premier of Russia, Chairman of the Board of Directors of RZD, Arkady Dvorkovich, stated that the issue of leaving the RZD by Alexander Bobreshov had been initiated by the new head of Oleg Belozerov.
According to the vice-premier, the staffing changes in the management of the RJD are not related to the change of head of the company.
OS previously reported that the first Deputy Transport Minister, Oleg Belozerov, was the head of the RZZZ instead of Vladimir Yakunin UAO, who was in charge of the financial block.
The new head of the company announced for the first time reforms in the monopoly: within a year and a half a new system of freight tariffs will be established.
Read more about the transformations in the company in OS, RZZ will rewrite the prices.
This year, a study by the Association of Russian Managers “Top-1,000 Russian Managers” is published for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian top-level managers, the study sums up the work of Russian managers over a year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of last year's rating winners.
Last year ' s winners are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for the current year ' s rating and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the original list is invited to nominate up to 10 new managers from other companies, who would be usefully added to the pool.
It is possible to nominate the following directors of the company ' s functional areas: financial director, commercial director, marketing director, staff director, IT director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Relations with Authorities, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each expert-proposed manager is invited to participate in the ratings and is given the opportunity to nominate his management team and up to 10 new managers from other companies.
The nominations are based on the sectoral classification of the Association of Managers: Information Technology, Commercial Banks, Forest and Forest Processing, Engineering, Media, Steel, Multidimensional Holdings, Professional Services, Communications and Telecommunications, Consumer Products, Insurance, Construction, Commerce, Transport, Finance, Pharmaceuticals, Chemical Industry, Energy and Fuel Complex.
Each participant is provided with a login and password for accessing the website www.top10000.amr.ru, where they see information about the other participants and can make their estimates according to the criteria proposed for each function.
The rating methodology is based on the "best choose the best" principle: top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
Such a principle allows for the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
Individual meetings of expert commissions are invited to invite all candidates for the current year's ratings and multiple candidates for previous years' ratings.
The Commissions are organized on a functional basis: the Commission for the Approval of the List of Supreme Leaders and the eight Commissions for the Approval of Heads of Functions.
The meetings of the expert commissions are invited to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (the locations are kept strictly on the Internet and are classified prior to the publication of the rating) or to make updates to them in accordance with the attached list of stand-by candidates.
The names of the companies are given according to Russian language rules and the rules of OS.
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
Investment rate is 10-13%.
Experts estimate that the small and medium-sized business credit market last January/April was 40 per cent low.
What are your estimates of the situation today?
Since the panic of the end of 2014 - early 2015, lending to HCMs has declined significantly.
The reason is clear: sharp increases in interest rates.
Loaning for 25-30% of the annual was not beneficial to anyone.
If a bank could have placed all its possible problems on a higher stake in the future, from delays to non-returns, it is impossible to do so now: the stakes are already cloudy.
For the business, the current level of UXO lending rates is uncomfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their profitability.
The rate of 10 to 13 per cent would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns.
How do you estimate the demand of entrepreneurs for credit is being met?
The situation has improved slightly since the fall in the interest rate of the CB.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, clients started to apply for loans much less.
First of all, business does not understand its prospects for development and future incomes.
Today, business has one option: to learn how to work with the current economic situation in the country and region.
There is a need to monitor current results more closely, to monitor cash flows.
At the same time, if financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to upgrade equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this ultimately allows the company to make the products more competitive and to keep business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the major trends in the lending market for HCMs that will strengthen and influence its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The medium-rate projection will depend largely on the Central Bank policy, and the regulator is now demonstrating consistency in the reduction of the key rate.
However, it is not worth waiting for the price of credit to drop radically for the UXO.
In the current situation, inflation is primarily a problem that makes it necessary to increase interest rates to generate real income.
Moreover, the value of money in Russia will remain high even if the rates of the CB are reduced.
With regard to the level of delay, small- and medium-sized business companies, which are traditionally limited in both cash and economic behaviour options, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I wouldn't expect a substantial reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country ' s economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's how the word Mazda is written by Japanese hieroglyphs.
It's beautiful, cynical, and at the same time quite difficult for those who're used to Cyrillic or Latin.
So the new CX-5 crossover, like any other brand model, is attractive from the outside, technically perfect inside.
Japan’s simply “Japanscostic” can bring attachment to the products of the rising sun to a state of total exhilaration.
You can make all the arguments you want for cars from other countries, and the person will even agree in principle with those arguments, but the whole conversation is rife with the final phrase, "But it's a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people should probably love not only technology but all other Japanese.
Quoting from Base's walk, fixing Wasabi's food, collecting catanas and dressing your girlfriend -- no, not in kimono, of course, but in Japanese street fashion: nice, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps Japanese school uniforms are the only uniform girls would love to wear after school.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of CX-5 is the radiator grid with five horizontal lines.
But the new pattern of headlamps and backlights, which will immediately recognize the car in the flow of cars, changes the shape of the car much more.
As in the past, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensual, but the appearance is strict.
You don't have to call the police.
CX-5, one of the safest in the world, can only be driven by stoic Japanese tranquillity.
The diesel engine of 2.2 litres provides a high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine of 175 litres s. to a total of 5.9 litres. The power train shall be assembled exclusively by automatic transmission and full transmission.
Black shoes, black coat, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can select leggings with a print from the police tape Not Cross.
However, the Mazda did their best to prevent you from driving your own CX-5 accident.
To further improve comfort, while maintaining excellent control, the suspension was rebuilt with the design of the front and rear amortizers, and the shape of the front lower levers was optimized.
The full transmission system is adapted to Russian conditions.
Road and engine noise at high speeds is reduced by 13 per cent.
The flower bath or strip is as boring as the budget sedan.
It's different if a girl wears a bathing suit with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of a role fighter.
She'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved structure for both front and rear seats, which provides an optimal reserve of space for both broad shoulders and long legs - who owns what.
And the long legs will probably appreciate that the edges at the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in the exteriors.
The largest set of active Mazda security systems is proposed for CX-5.
Radars, lasers and cameras are used to identify potential threats.
There's adaptive lighting here, and warnings about the descent from the stripe, and monitoring dead zones, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in class.
Comfortable, with a minimum projection, it contains a load of 561 litres. The rear seats are folded in a ratio of 4:2:4 with each section fitted with a separate drawbar and extend the baggage compartment to 1,560 litres.
The cartoon hero's suit in Japan is called "kigurums".
It's especially hot for a pyjama-kiguru.
It's got everything in it!
Of course I'm sleeping.
But also to entertain little kids.
Or just walking around like that on the street...
I mean, it's so great to be able to choose -- cool clothes, behavior or a car.
Thank you for helping with the preparation of the material at Kawaikat.
Kyiv tore up the atomic unia.
Kyiv has officially formalized Ukraine's refusal to cooperate with Russia to build Khmelnitsk nuclear power plant.
The Supreme is pleased to have voted on Wednesday since the second attempt to terminate the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements for the construction of the third and fourth blocs were signed as early as 2010-2012, but the project could not be started.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law abolishing an agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation to build a third and fourth block on the Khmelnitsk nuclear power plant.
The bill submitted by the Government had been passed only after the second vote, the first time it had been supported by 210 deputies, with the required minimum of 226, but then 234 members of Parliament had voted in favour of the draft.
The Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant laid under the Soviet Union was originally designed to have four power units of 1 GW with VWR-type reactors, but only two were built.
Negotiations with Moscow on extension had led to an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and in 2011-2012 the Rada had enacted relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the Ukrainian budget, it was assumed that the construction of blocks would have to be on loan from the Russian side, but the funds had never been made available.
Following the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in the relations of the two countries, Kiev began to end relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, declaring its refusal to cooperate on Khmelnitsk nuclear power plant and on the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area in which relations remained was the purchase of fuel in the Russian Federation for operating Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of the country's electricity generation), as the Ukrainian NAEC “Energoat” had not yet replaced Russian supplies.
The plans to complete the Khmelnitsk nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: as early as 2014, talks with the Czech Skoda JS were announced in Kiev.
UN Gensec against the use of military force in resolving the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated during a press conference that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
“There is no military solution”, the AP responds to a question about Russian military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also announced that he would meet with the Foreign Ministers of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the permanent members of the UNSC later this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, the Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Russian Federation, Nikolai Bogdanovsky, reported that the General Staff did not rule out the possibility of establishing a future air force base in Syria.
Not yet.
"But everything is possible," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Previously, UO reported that the US did not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who claimed that military assistance to official Damascus was necessary to combat the terrorist group “Islamic State” that had been banned in the Russian Federation.
For more information on US doubts about Russian aid to Syria, see the U.S. Russian Military Presence in Syria, which concerns Washington.
In the PA, OSCE reports a possible meeting of parliamentarians from Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA), Arthur Gerasimov, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in south-eastern Ukraine.
“What I know: a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations”, the TASS quotes Mr. Gerasimov.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreements and “to return to the normal lives of our countries”.
On the question whether, in his view, the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level - in the “Normandian” or in the form of a contact group on the OSCE PA site - was currently possible, Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue had been held, there were mine agreements.
At the same time, politics has said that any type of dialogue is being promoted in Kiev.
The representative of Ukraine at the talks, the former President of the country, Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugano republics had not changed their positions in the tripartite talks in principle yet, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the Electoral Commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the municipal Duma elections by allocating 12 parliamentary mandates on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral irregularities have been made by KDPF representatives accused by an intruder of “falsification”.
The opposition ' s comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the group refused to organize a referendum on the lifting of the rent for the renovation of multi-family houses.
The city bar officially presented the results of the election for the proud Nizhny Novgorod municipal electoral district.
A total of 1.03 million voters were included in the electoral rolls in Lower Novgorod, 746,700 votes were issued to the district commissions and 268,000 votes were cast in the elections.
More than 11,700 ballots were declared invalid and 24 lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed to political parties, depending on their votes.
According to the lists of the “One Russian Federation”, six deputies in the gordum rely on Dmitry Swatkovsky, Dmitri Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vjaceslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagor.
The party leader Vladimir Zhirinowski received the sole mandate of the LDDP.
The two PRRA mandates are distributed between Vladimir Boulanov and State Duma Deputy Alexander Tarnayev.
The three mandates of “Just Russia” are given to Alexander Rasumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether or not they will serve as deputies in the city ' s mind: if the mandate is abandoned, he will turn to the next candidate on the desk.
The chairman of the oblast committee, Alexander Makeev, informed the members of the commission that he was in the process of putting on duty for a “link of telegrams from Zhirinovsky and others” to give up mandates.
At the time of the adoption of the election protocol, the representatives of the CPRF stated that there had been multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, a member of the councillor ' s committee with the right to vote, proposed not to recognize the results of the vote in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that the head of the administration of the Sormovsky district had ordered the closure of the entrance to the administration building where the four district commissions were located.
Members of the State of Oudma, the candidates themselves and the observers could not go inside for a long time, and the dramatic scandal of storming the doors of the parade administration was shown on television.
All observers and commissioners with the right to vote had the opportunity to attend meetings of district commissions.
The head stopped access until the vote was over and the district commissions had not yet arrived to deliver their ballot papers.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
“The chapter was then corrected, and interested persons were able to attend all the meetings”, a member of Natalia Andrushin’s berthing chamber was partaking.
The Communists objected to the fact that the Zaputate of the Assembly of the Region of Ludmile Aristoba had been illegally held for more than four hours in the blocked administrative building, and a complaint was sent to the investigating committee.
The opposition also resented that, on election day, a number of PECs began sealing boxes at 6-7 a.m. by posting early ballots.
However, the commissioners with the right to vote and observers had not been notified, so they had already arrived at the beginning of the election at 8 a.m.
The Communists are confident that the ballot papers could be thrown unchecked during the morning before the opening of polling stations.
However, the mountains, which had already dealt with more than 124 complaints on various grounds, according to Alexander Makeev, did not find any irregularities with the casts of unaccounted ballots.
The members of the commission did not support the proposal of their colleague from Fair Russia, Maria Popova, to come out through an lick, with amendments to regional legislation, in order to clearly establish the time of opening envelopes with early ballots, which would then enter the urn.
"Go to the CEC as your initiative," advised Ms. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, Sergey Samahin, a member of the CPRF, came under heavy charges, shouting that he ignored dozens of complaints and covered up forgery in the elections.
"You're not here at the rally, be careful to say it!" the chairman of the bar was offended.
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
By 27 September, the poll is to approve the overall results of the election, after which the first meeting of the City Duma of Lower Novgorod of the Sixth Assembly will be scheduled within three weeks.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the urban electoral commission refused to register the political party “Communists of Russia” with the initiative group for the holding of a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to put forward two questions for discussion by the suburban people: whether they agreed that the rents for the renovation of multi-family houses should be “immediately abolished” and the rents for housing and utilities should be “freeze until 2020”.
However, Irina Maslov's lawyer explained that the application of the Communists of Russia was contrary to the law.
The FedEx is mixed in nature, reducing projections for 2016.
FedEx reported on the discomfort of the last quarter, and the giant delivery service reduced the forecast of annual profits due to the decline in demand for freight services and increased costs in its land transport unit.
The company also stated that it planned to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time, FedEx reported last year that 50,000 temporary workers would be hired for holidays.
Its shares increased by about 2.5 per cent in preliminary tenders 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that he planned to make between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that ended next May, which was 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts assumed $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast decreases despite an average increase of 4.9 per cent, which will come into effect on 4 January, and an increase in charges for the surface transport of heavy or fixed cargo, which begins in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase revenue from last year ' s decline in expenditure, increase in gross income and increase in online trade.
The President and CEO, Fred Smith, stated that the company “was stable in response to the weaker economic conditions than forecast, especially in production and world trade”.
Labour plans for holidays were announced the day after the competition, UPS, announced that they planned to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same amount as they did last year.
FedEx earned $692 million for the quarter that ended August 31, an increase of 6 per cent over the year before.
The share income was $2.42, close to the forecast of an average of $2.44 for a stock investment research survey conducted by 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zachs estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered from a decline in international fixed-term transport in recent years, resulting in a lack of growth in gross income in its express transport unit.
However, the purchase boom on the Internet has dramatically improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenues from land transport increased by 29 per cent, but operating income remained largely unchanged owing to the increased costs of large shipments and self-insurance.
The express transport unit earned higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector, income fell due to higher labour costs.
In preliminary bidding, about an hour before the opening of the exchange, FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday by 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the 11 June record.
At the most anticipated meeting in several years, the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from Honduran redwood, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end, a well-decorated meeting room, two floors above them, will hang a wall image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank received a double assignment from Congress: to maximize employment in the US and to keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is a third, unwritten commission: financial stability.
And this third commission may be an unknown factor in the almost predicted decision that will be announced on Thursday about whether the US economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by almost zero short-term interest rates since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data show strong growth in the economy, recent turmoil in the global financial markets can deter already cautious federal leaders from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds – even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
“It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration,” said Lindsay M. Piegza, the chief brokerage economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the stakes, the increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she observed.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve, which in itself triggers fluctuations in the financial market.
About half of the economists recently surveyed Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to withhold this, with a key indicator showing only about 30 per cent probability of rapid recovery.
This could lead to a fall in the stock market if the federal system raises the stakes, provided that decision makers do not soften the blow of the promise that the next increase will not be forthcoming.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The take-off was provoked by expectations that the federal system's strategy-makers would stay the bet this week,” said John Lonsky, chief economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It would be a surprise if the federal system raised the stakes at this point in time," he observed.
If the management of the Federal Reserve does so, "they will have to go far in approving their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so that they don't panic."
Other experts objected that raising the rate could calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty as to how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the federal system seemed inclined to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, making the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen stated in the spring and early summer that she was looking forward to raising the rate this year, despite the complaints from the liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although new jobs slowed down in August, the growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1 per cent last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and almost at the level that the Federal system considers to be full employment.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to fall below the central bank’s annual target of 2 per cent, the Federal System’s management stated that the key cause was the temporary effect of a sharp fall in oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the contraction of the labour market”, noted Ian Shepherdson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The average Dow Johns index for industrial stock fell by 16% relatively high in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy could slow global growth.
The market has partially regained its position this month, and the Dow Johns index is now about 10% below the high May value.
For the management of the Federal Reserve, market disturbances further complicate the difficult calculation of the timing of interest rate increases.
“In the absence of information on what has happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have been twisted at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior UCLA researcher Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Federal Reserve Officer.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is a great deal of uncertainty about the consequences for the American economy, and they have little reliable data since the recent events in China,” said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal system and should not technically be taken into account in making these decisions.
But essentially, the Federal Reserve has become a global financial power.
The Central Bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
A mere hint from the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could silence its monetary expansion caused market shocks around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve will not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult with representatives of other Headquarters banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process, “More Arts Than Science”, noted Zachary Carabel, head of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve there have been cases of overreaction to financial market movements that seem to be unrelated to economic principles”.
Laker, a member with voting rights of an influential Federal Open Market Committee who insisted on raising the rate, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian financial crisis has led the Federal System to lower its base rate by 0.75 per cent in three sessions, “despite the limited identifiable implications for growth in the US”, Laker said.
A year later, the Federal System’s leaders cancelled these cuts.
The federal reserve system should focus on stability only in times of great crisis, such as the collapse of the market in 2008,” said Adam S. Pozen, a former member of the interest committee at Bank of England.
The last panic didn't get close to that level, he said.
"You wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're afraid of rising rates because markets are shaken," said Pozen, president of the Peterson World Economics Institute.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to have a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think that they should be ahead of events.
You need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/market was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often called Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.

The Speaker of the State Duma, Sergey Narishkin, admits that the US is deliberately destabilizing the Middle East so that waves of refugees flow into Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this view to journalists in Ulaanbaatar in the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a promoter of conspiratory theories, but the question is itself: is Europe the ultimate goal of those who, with such manic perseverance in recent years, have destabilized the countries of North Africa and the Middle East?" he wondered.
“Surely someone thought and knew that the flows of refugees, these poor and deprived people who are fleeing death, would run to the well-being of the EU,” he added.
Narishkin asked: “How many political leaders in Europe have spoken openly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally flooding their countries?”
"No, old Europe, with few exceptions, prefers to remain silent," he said.
According to Narishkin, NATO flouts many European values and norms of international law.
“Europe, unfortunately, has long and unbiasedly watched and watched the military boots sewn according to NATO standards as well as moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law,” the Speaker stressed.
Government forces and their loyal militias are opposed by rebels, who are mainly Islamists.
Later, the terrorist group “Islamic State” banned in Russia joined the Syrian Government's opponents.
The US supports the rebels who oppose both Assad and IH.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
Syria’s president described the cause of the West’s aversion to Russia.
The Western claims to countries such as Syria, Russia, and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign States.
Syrian President Bashar Assad expressed this view in an interview with RT, Channel I, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners or sovereign States.
In those countries, he wished to remove one person and put another in his place, who would act in the interest of Western countries rather than in the interests of his own homeland, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of Western media in the wake of the coup in Ukraine.
For them, he said, Russian President Vladimir Putin “was transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy, a king, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, which came to power in an undemocratic way, despite being elected by democratic elections recognized in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West’s constant statements that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he did, at the request of the people, not at the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communiqué.
“If the people want him to stay, the President stays, or else they should leave immediately,” he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that cooperation with them was taking place.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
Speaking of military support from Iran, the Syrian leader observed that the country supported the Syrian State in politics, economy and military matters.
He denied the allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
“Surely there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always taken place”, he explained.
As far as the rest of the States are concerned, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to combat terrorism.
“We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Iigil coalition led by the United States”, Al-Assad pointed out.
The number of deaths exceeded 230,000 and the number of refugees exceeded 11.5 million.
A part of the territory was seized by the terrorist group Islamic State, which was banned in Russia.
The U.S.-led International Coalition has launched air strikes on IG positions.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: Lenta.ru
US Secretary of State John Kerry conducted a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
Reuters reports this with a reference to John Kirby, a representative of State Department.
It is noted that the subject of the interview was the conflict in Syria.
Kirby did not, however, provide additional details.
At the same time, he said that the US had tools for Russia's “further isolation” if it supported Syrian President Bashar Assad, transmitting the RIA News.
According to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lavrov, during his conversation with Kerry, once again emphasized the need to create a unified front against terrorist groups operating in that country.
Ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis and possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula were also discussed.
In addition, some bilateral issues were raised.
Earlier, United States officials stated that Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and expressed concern about the strengthening of Moscow’s support for Assad.
In Washington, they said that if Russia continued to support Assad, it would be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, President Dmitri Peskov of Russia’s press secretary said that the country would not be in international isolation.
The rebels are in favour of the overthrow of Assad's regime.
A terrorist organization, Islamic State, seized part of the territory.

The beard called the American newspaper's information a libel against Strykov.
The former president of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Borodai, denied the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He announced this in a telephone interview to the correspondent Lenta.ru.
The note at the Washington Post is beautiful because it's totally overreacted.
The former Minister of Defence of the DND, Igor Scharkov, naturally did not bind and he went out of Donbassa territory in a very high mood, without ropes, without three furs of money attributed to him by different characters,” he noted.
According to Beroday, it was actually about the shooter talking to an American newspaper reporter.
"Yes, I said that it was urgent to remove Sholkov from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," said the former head of government of the DNR.
The bearder stressed that he did not know why an American journalist decided to write that the Shooters had been taken to Russian territory “linked”.
I suspect it's a provocation.
If it's not a provocation, it's surprisingly misunderstood words, because I stressed that the Shooters were leaving themselves,” observed the Bearder.
"It's a libel against both me and Shooter," he concluded.
Earlier, an article appeared on the pages of The Washington Post, which contained the words of Berodai that he had forcibly taken Sholkov into Russian territory.
According to the publication, Beardaille noted that he had to bind his partner.
The Polish authorities have begun searching for a train with Nazi gold.
Polish timber workers have started cutting trees over an underground tunnel, where there are some reports of a train with gold from the Third Reich.
Work started on Tuesday, 15 September, reports Reuters.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary in order to verify the credibility of rumours about the railways with treasures.
Weapons and precious minerals may be inside the train.
On 31 August, the Polish voivodeship governor Tomás Smolarz (Tomasz Smolarz) suggested that new evidence of a gold train was no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to block the search area.
Three days earlier, Poland's Deputy Minister of Culture, Peter Zhukhowski, stated that local treasure detectors had found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich as described in the legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and the jewels were discovered, they would become the property of the State treasury and the treasure would not be handed over to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of a law firm approached the Polish city of Walbžih with a report that they had found a train in a sealed tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The chief drugologist of the Russian Federation proposed that tobacco should be banned from selling to persons under the age of 21.
Russia’s main drugologist proposed to ban the sale of tobacco until 21 years of age.
Yevgeny Brune noted that until that age, “any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - is particularly harmful”.
So he said live on Radio Voice Moscow, commenting on the fact that the Speaker of Souveda Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21.
Man grows unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, and you're physically ready for it.
Mentally, he's ready for a full life in society since he was 21.
"We know from scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, is only fully mature by the age of 21, "Brune observed.
Previously, Sultan Hamzaev, a member of the Public Chamber and project leader of the “Tresty Russia” project, told the “Ivestians” that Matvieenko had supported the initiative to raise the age of alcohol and “agreed to raise the issue again with the Public Chamber at the site of the upper House of Parliament”.
According to the activist, a working group will soon be set up in the Federation Council to draft a draft law under the leadership of Matvieenko.
The Bible was asked to check compliance with the Child Information Protection Law
The resident of Novosibirsk requested the Regional Prosecutor's Office to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law “On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development”, a statement was made on 16 September by Correspondent Sib.fm.
The author stated that on 26 August 2015, he purchased a Bible at the Chitai City store on the Red Prospect, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his view, violated the FZ “On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development”.
On 16 September, the application was accepted by the Prosecutor ' s Office in Novosibirsk.
The response to the address of the resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
Much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, the complainant commented to Correspondent Sib.fm.
Besides, it's a very substantial problem that will engender society.
It will begin to reread the Bible, which it has not done before.
The Brazilian Paediatrics Union of Rio Grandi promotes healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a scandalous method that is intended to convince women of the need for proper nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves showing pictures of babies sucking breasts that are painted with pictures of harmful food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
In view of the high energy needs of pregnant and pregnant women, it is recommended that the daily calorie rate be increased by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that one increase in calories is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy nutrition of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy nutrition on the child ' s immune system has been identified.
Under Hamburg, a train hit a school bus.
A train crashed into a school bus near Hamburg that was stuck on the railroad.
A 23-year-old woman driver, realizing that she could not move off the rails, ordered 60 pupils to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they had a collision in front of them.
He was videotaped by one of the students.
The emergency caused a panic among the students.
Some children began to cry and run along the side of the road.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was harmed by a miracle except one train passenger who was slightly injured.
The damage from the accident was estimated at Euro300,000.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) leadership called for a ban on boxing in the country following the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries sustained in a battle with the Filipino Carlo Magali.
The battle for one of the regional titles of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category of up to 57.15 kg on Friday ended with Magali's victory in the 12th round.
Brown was in the hospital with a brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to a life support device.
Brown won 22 victories in the professional ring, suffered only two defeats, and one battle ended in nothing.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second death rate among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student, Bradon Smith, died of injuries sustained in the ring.
The AMA now recommends that it be banned, rather than this sport.
I understand this is happening unintentionally, said the vice president of the organization, Stephen Pairnis.
But in the form that boxing now exists, there will always be situations where an athlete suffers from a hemorrhage or brain injury, leading to either death or severe damage.
For that reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue living with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that brings together practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, Sergey Narishkin, said that the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians was unacceptable.
He said that at the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We regard this as unacceptable actions, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shame and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue”, said the politician.
In addition, Narishkin called on OSCE PA participants to re-establish the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's get our morals back into politics.
Let us return dialogue and the right to international communication.
Let us restore humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
"Doubleness never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Speaker of the Russian State called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
“First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and immediately convene our inter-parliamentary group”, Naryshkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be commended.
"This is almost the only common ground where there is still discussion of how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," stressed the politician.
We recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until 18 September.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple or three days.
The world champion at Sergey Shubenkov's light athletics.
This season is a triumphant one for a 24-year-old light-athlete from Barnaul Sergey Shubenkova.
He managed to win 110 meters at his crown distance with barriers to European command, set several records, and, above all, to become a world champion, the first in history to be a domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the Brilliant League, taking third place.
The New News has asked Schubenkov to share the impressions of the departing season.
Sergei, is the season not over for you yet?
Yeah, I'm going to perform at the World War Games, which will take place in October in Korea, and then I'm going to think about resting.
It's true I'm going to be at home in Barnaul, and being at home is still a different condition.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You once said autumn was your favorite time of year.
The end of August, early September, is a great time.
The passions after the main start of the season are overwhelmed, and the burden of responsibility is no longer pressed.
You can have a little fun at relaxing.
Plus, you know, vacation's pretty soon...
Are you tired?
After all, it's a special season, a lot of positive emotions...
Fatigue always accumulates by the end of the season.
And it doesn't matter what I did more, winning or losing.
Every competition is stress.
Flighting, moving, it doesn't go unnoticed.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But right now, I'm feeling a lot of emotion, of course.
What's the matter? I'm just happy.
By the time you finished the Beijing World Cup, do you come back often?
It happens.
And you journalists don't let me forget it.
But in fact, I think it's bad for an athlete who lives in old victories to run his successful race over and over again.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple or three days, and we have to move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season much different from the usual season?
I can't say there was something special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
Trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the prep, then at home again.
It's the usual.
But with the coach, the challenge was to try to get to a new level I haven't been to.
Almost all winter time was spent laying down the base.
We ran through a bunch of sneakers, we put in exercise in general physical training, which included both traction and seating, and we pumped our back.
And then they went into barrier training, and they were doing a lot of tech.
Have you been watching your rivals?
I'm always trying to do that, and there's no problem with it in the Internet age.
I watched the European Winter Championship, and there, in a barrier sprint, the French took over the pedestal!
I thought I'd do something, cut this company down.
With every start this season, you've added and added to the results.
Did it give you confidence?
I've got all the last seasons coming up in a similar pattern.
There's no way I'm running first 13.20 and then 13.50.
I always spin my uniform gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All work has focused on this result.
But the paradox is, you kind of feel like you're ready for a feat, and you don't always get to show your willingness at a competition.
How was it, for example, at the London Olympics?
I, to be honest, that semi-final race I tried to forget right away.
It was really good, it could actually run out of 13 seconds.
Even if you repeated your best score at the time, you'd be the bronze prizer of the game.
But bad luck.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
What about it?
It was in Tagu.
I really wanted to get into the finals at the time, and I had a program that was perfect.
And he fell right off in the morning, in the preliminary race.
That's when I realized that tearing my head off means not running anywhere at all.
Two years later, at the Moscow World Cup, he entered the finals with the best time.
I remember how I felt before the final race: I really wanted to win gold at the time!
How do you build up a decent speed, not lose your head, not shut down?
That's the hardest part.
You have to be very careful, focused on technology, so you don't have to break the barriers.
I noticed that it's much easier when you adjust to the process rather than the outcome.
And when you get the feeling you're running and it's like you're doing it!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the interior, after their first major successes, are trying to move closer to the capital.
You've never thought like that before?
It's better at home anyway.
I don't know where I am without my coach, who needs me?
It might be nice to have better conditions, but I'm trying to be content with what I have.
How long have you two been together?
Ever since I was 12 years old, since I went to athletic.
Actually, first I trained with his wife, who worked with the kids, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then I jumped in length, tripled.
The children's multi-fight was when the ball was thrown, jumping from place to place...
When I was 14, I tried running with the barriers, and I liked it.
Since the first race, it's been possible to meet the second grade of adulthood.
That's what I'm doing.
There's never been any fear of barriers?
One day, I got a deal with them.
But there's always been a lot of work on technology.
There's one race that I've been tormenting!
But you can't get away with this routine.
The tech needs to be sharpened all the time - so that I can wake up at night, I get up right now and run through the barriers.
Everyone who saw your race in Beijing says it was a very beautiful race.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I usually don't review my races, and I couldn't help it.
But efficiency needs to be further worked on - there's no limit to perfection.
Aren't you afraid that winning a year before the Olympics will be a heavy burden?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
If you've chosen this path, you have to go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, you don't have to feel any extra load.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashville
Well, I'm not so naive that I'm amazed at the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I know. Don't feed them bread. Give them a ride.
And even though I didn't fly the flag, and the same thing, exactly the same thing, I've said a million times here, and I didn't call anyone the bastard directly, another thing hurts me.
All my pseudo-friends were in a minute, and they disappeared in a second.
The pressing I'm exposed to is so strong that even I, when I've seen the species of boys, think people are full of whites.
It was like walking, walking, and you were attacked by a mob, and you'd have to make a fuss.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a howitzer, old man, I'm scared.
The other thing is, there's no support.
I didn't have any illusions, but now...
The best thing about me was self-sufficiency, so bite it.
And giving passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson can only be idiots.
I wish I, the best journalist, was a shameful job.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili described Crimean events in sharp form:
What they did to the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I believe that the reference to how the drunk Khrushchev tried to sign something doesn't fit into the overall picture of the human dorm.
It's like coming to the neighbor and taking his apartment...
The war from the Kremlin took place, and it only ends there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like the summer of 2008, it started with a call from some bastard from the Kremlin's lockup.
I have any idea who it might be...
Cobzon doesn't have much left to live.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Is he gonna lose his apartment?
Well, they destroyed his monument.
Of course, people remember him as insulting their small homeland.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seventh leads the ranking despite the Ninth's attempts to highlight the loss of leaders at Today Show.
Carl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson's trip to Canberra to highlight the implications of the Liberal Party's announcement of a leader's release failed to raise Today's ratings significantly.
The 9th morning show was broadcast from the state capital after Malcolm Turnbull's defeat of Tony Abbott.
The rival, Sunrise, with leading David Koch and Samantha Armitage, is stuck in London in a week-long series of international broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
This torture seems to have been of little importance to Australian television viewers, with a Sunrise audience of 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities, compared to the Today audience of 339,000.
Today scored slightly more than its ratings on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap varied between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers in September, compared to 314,000 in Today.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are more powerful than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the update!
Published by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015.
The big news for Seven was the amazing 800 Words debut with former star of Packed to the Rafters, Eric Thomson.
A new drama about the newly widowed father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children, gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics reasoned whether Thomson could handle the popular show alone, without Rebecca Gibney's Rafters star.
The result of last night is the loud answer "yes."
The X Factor Seventh remained strong with a audience of 1.136 million viewers, easily bypassing The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For the Seventh, luck and failure on the second evening of Chase Australia were mixed.
The first half hour (from 5 p.m. to 5 p.m.) of the new television show, led by Andrew O'Keefi, gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 5.30 p.m. to 6 p.m.), the figure jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 viewers, and the second half an overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat collected 620,000.
The drop in the Chase Australia ratings for the second night will make the Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5:30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which failed to replay the McGuir show.

Three finalists agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret's out?
Lana Jevon-Fellows, Sarah McKay and Snejean Marcoski may have accidentally shown us which of them will win at The Bachelor.
The woman who's gonna end up with Sam Wood in The Bachelor is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three girls who reached the finale, of course, remain silent about which one of them got his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snow Marcosky and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two of the three girls were to be left, they might have accidentally given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood remains silent until the end of Thursday.
All three women come into a lyric mood, explaining why Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, purpose, family values, joy as a reason why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
However, by answering the question, "If it isn't for you, who's supposed to get the last rose of Wood?" they could unwittingly tell us which one of them actually conquered the heart of The Bachelor.
Jevons-Fellows and Marcoski were sure to call MacKay the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam had a good relationship since day one.
"From the moment I joined the contest, I felt the energy (Sarah) and the energy of Sam, and I knew that they were very suitable for each other, and throughout the show, I had no doubt about it," said Jevons-Fellows.
"Sara is a very open man, easy and fun with her," she added Marcoski.
I saw them together, and there's really a gravitation between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna make a great couple.
MacKay herself said that, thanks to her home dates last week, she realized that Wood might be "the very person."
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it was definitely not just a game -- I believed him with all my heart," she says.
The question of whom to choose Voodoo, if it wasn't her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Sneezhan and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor shows on Wednesdays at 7.30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarrid Hein had several options to start his career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after he moved to the United States, as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hain chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would leave Hain on the bench for the rest of the game for losing the ball, which the former Australian rugby League player allowed on the first return of the pant in a win-win game with Minnesota with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayn another chance to get back the pant, and also used it in the game after Reggie W. Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed up on the good side after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of having the newcomers scattered in front of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hain at a press conference after the match.
Special reporter for 49ers Cam Inman reported that Hein also received support from Thomas McGoy, Special Team Coordinator, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hain lost the ball on the return of the pant by the Minnesota Waikings team during the first quarter.
This is the beginning of the NHL debut that Hain and his many Australian fans clearly did not expect.
You could see Hain fighting off the field after losing the ball, and then he told the host of the show "Hames and Andy" at Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a more unfortunate start for a career in the NFL.
"It happens, you're just thinking about the next game and that's all," said Hain.
Hain compared his debut with the 2007 Origin series of games, when the ball was thrown in his credit zone and Queensland tried.
In the end, this experience proved to be very useful for a 27-year-old player.
Hein photographed the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted the picture to Instagram.

In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of use of weapons at the airport in Siberia.
Openly defying President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his attempts to develop democracy were stopped.
There were clashes between migrants and the police at the Hungarian border.
Refugees protested at the border of Serbia near the Hungarian settlement of Resque, which turned into clashes with law enforcement.
As a result, Hungarian police used water wells and tear gas, handing over the Reuters.
Migrants stoned the police and tried to tear down the border fence.
Support has been sent to the scene of the clashes, and police officers have responded to the aggression by migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled into Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serb-Hungarian border by bus towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reports BBC.
The authorities had allowed migrants to enter Croatian territory and to transport them from there to the right country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament strengthened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments include the participation of the army in the protection of State frontiers, the prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, and the accelerated procedure for processing asylum requests.
The Hungarian court had already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serb border, and he would therefore be deported and would not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider the transfer of border protection functions to the Hungarian armed forces of the Hungarian Parliament in the near future.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a 175 km barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian confessed to committing the largest cyberattack in United States history.
An accused of the largest cyberattack in United States history, Russian Vladimir Drinkman confessed to stealing over 160 million credit card numbers, reports Reuters.
During the trial before the Federal Court of New Jersey, Drinkman confessed to collusion in order to obtain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, a Russian spoke of a collusion with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen who were accused of cyberattacking 15 companies.
The cumulative damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at $300 million.
“Such defendants as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, our privacy and our national security”, states U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman is facing 30 years of imprisonment and a fine of a million dollars.
When sentencing, the court will take account of the Russian confession and may reduce the sentence.
Drinkman's sentence will be announced on January 15th.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitri Smiljantz, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt for the crimes he is accused of.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk with Russia's support of Bashar Assad's regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, warned that Russia’s support for Syrian President Bashar Assad was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks exacerbating and widening the conflict and undermining our common goal of combating extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power”, says a report published on the U.S. State Department's website.
Kerry confirmed the commitment of the United States to fight the Islamic State (which is banned by the Supreme Court in Russia) in a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad “can never be a reliable member” of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of support for the Assad regime.
On the eve of the day, Joshua Ernest, the White House spokesman, threatened Russia with isolation unless it stopped supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed joining the international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media have often reported the presence of Russian troops on Syrian territory.
The head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, claimed that Russian soldiers had been in Syria for many years and were helping Syrians to master technology to use it against Islamists.
Four were killed when the police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the proposed new Constitution, as the official announced on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandei County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, chief of district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered at a police station, some throwing stones and arson bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to be capable of being killed, have caused such high mortality, but have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative.
This clash was the last violent protest in a few weeks in southern, plain Nepal, where the Madesi people claim that the new provinces under the new constitution will diminish their political influence.
Protests have also taken place in western Nepal, among Tararu citizens who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
On August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centralized for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been under way since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that claimed thousands of lives in April.
The legislators voted in favour of articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials announced that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise for 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in Irkutsk oblast.
It was built in the 1970s as a centre of the chemical industry, with a developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansk headed the new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
He presented the results of the first year of work, new projects and prospects to the correspondent, Regional.
Oleg Valerjevic, where did you start your job as mayor?
I first reviewed the results of the financial and business audits and initiated an independent audit of local budget expenditure.
The municipal property was then audited.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the workload to five days.
Previously, the papers could go through the courts for months.
Activities have been developed to improve the income base and optimize costs.
Last November, a Government retreat was held in Sayansk to address the socio-economic development of the Territory.
The city did not have any design and design documentation (PPA) for any site.
Without that, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of POJA for roads, kindergarten, a northern sewer and a water reservoir.
Roadworks are already under way on two sites.
How is the Russian President's decree on the construction of kindergartens being implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
This positive demography has not been observed in the city for the past 27 years.
So the issue of providing places in kindergartens is one of the most pressing today.
Since 1 September, kindergarten No. 10 has been closed to major maintenance for 320 places.
The estimated cost of repairs is 86 million roubles.
So far, the city has never received such funds.
Last year, after the renovation, kindergarten No. 23 was opened and 200 children are now attending.
The repairs were co-financed from the regional and local budgets and cost more than 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment have been secured, and the People's Initiatives programme has also helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the rank of children between the ages of one and a half and three years.
We don't have three to seven-year-old children's queues.
Are investors interested in the Territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city must be done, first and foremost, by the Sayan enterprises, and that they must be employed.
As early as October, a 60-family home for orphans in the Leningrad district is under operation.
With regard to construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangarya, which is part of the economic-class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 blocks will commence shortly.
In total, we have announced the construction of 10,000 square metres of housing for those wishing to participate in the programme.
One condition is that the dwelling must not exceed 30,000 roubles per square metre, which includes a “turnkey” finish.
If we can handle the set volumes, we can continue to participate in the programme.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
The Sayan Porcine Complex was built in the Territory and sold at no cost in 2004.
We're working with the D.A. to challenge this deal.
Especially since the land under the target is federal property.
Work is under way with Moscow and the transfer of 88 hectares to the regional property is being decided, followed by the transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor willing to invest 1.5 billion roubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
We'll have 900 jobs with a pig-to-peak launch, which will be a big help to the city.
Is there an institution of social partnership developed in Sayansk?
We have some 140 social and economic partnership treaties.
Many projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Enterprises such as the East Centre, the Novo-Zimin TEC, the Saiyan Broyler SLA, the CPA of the IDF are strongly supported, and the management of these enterprises responds to all requests.
By the day of the day of the OLG, Sayansky Broyler gave the city a town of children, East Centre renovated a horseyard where specialists were dealing with children of the paediatrics, costing more than 1 million rubles.
Sponsored funds have helped to improve the area of the city's registry.
Sponsors helped celebrate City Day in a colorful way.
As in the old days, there was a parade involving city groups and organizations.
The history of the city, a book of Saiyan poets, was published.
The commemorative medals have been given to the first builders and people who have made a major contribution to the development of Sayanska.
The Mecenates also participate in the City Charitable Fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800,000 roubles have been designed to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, and to support children from poor families.
How are human resources problems in the social sphere addressed in Sayansk?
There's a shortage of doctors and teachers in the city.
The provision of housing for professionals is essential to address the human resources issue.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, and four teachers have been provided with a service home.
We have a housing programme that can be privatized in five years.
Plans are to restructure the building, which will have eight additional apartments for teachers.
Teachers and doctors are also involved in the "Little for the Russian Family" programme.
In the long run, building a house for budget workers.
Most importantly, there's a working team in town with which I can deal with the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
Sayansk and our region have great potential.
The Duma has introduced a bill on the indexation of sociales, taking into account price increases.
A bill has been submitted to the State Duma to index social pensions annually since 1 February, taking into account rising prices.
The author of the document, Alexander Lomakin-Rumyansev, a member of the Fair Russia, also proposes that an additional indexation of pensions be carried out on 1 April, if the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum exceeds the rate of increase in prices for goods and services.
According to the legislation in force, social benefits are indexed annually from 1 April, taking into account the rate of growth of the pensioner ' s subsistence minimum in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law submitted to the Lower House provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions in the light of the rate of growth in consumer prices.
The first indexation is postponed to 1 February and the second is held on 1 April.
The head of the OSCE PA told Mogerini that no sanctions against parliamentarians should be imposed.
In an official letter to the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogerini, the Speaker of the OSCE PA, Ilkka Kanerva, declared that sanctions against legislators participating in the assembly were not permitted.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar, Nikolai Kovalev.
According to TASS, the signatures of European parliamentarians, including the representatives of Cyprus, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, were collected in support of the Kanerva position.
"A strong enough support has already emerged," said Kovalev.
He had previously stated that the head of the OSCE PA had intended to collect the signatures of the deputies, who had indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians were not allowed.
In particular, Kovalev noted that Kanerva had promised to raise the issue to the level of EU leadership and “send a petition”.
NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Green Cape Islands is 60%.
The wide front of the low-pressure area about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Cape Islands is likely to become a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, reported by the United States National Hurricane Center on Tuesday.
Another clearly defined area of low pressure around the middle between the Green Cape and the Small Antilles also has a 60 per cent probability of a tropical cyclone developing in the next two days, reports synoptics from Miami.
Google is launching a doubling campaign to collect $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) launched a doubling campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help flooding European refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google used an uncharacterized personal approach to announce a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the leaders, Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We were on dubious trains and buses, suffering hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has intensified, many people like my family are desperately in need of help.
The donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations dealing with refugees and migrants: Médecins sans frontières, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google announced that it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until the amount on google.com/refugeerelief reached $11 million.
Europe has faced the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, most of which resulted from a four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing from war-torn Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.

Diabetes with slight obesity can be helped by obesity surgery
The benefits of obesity surgery for people with small obesity with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that diabetics with small obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive nonsurgery treatment.
"Death statistics don't appear immediately," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who wrote about a new study in the column of the JAMA Surgery editor.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce stomach size.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of organizations to absorb food.
In a few years, bariatric surgery has proved to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but basic studies have been conducted among people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (MTI) 35 or more.
IMT, the weight measure relative to growth, is considered normal at 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or more indicates that people are overweight and people with IMTs over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, ventricular bypass and sleeve ghastrectomy, with type 2 diabetes treatment for people with low obesity.
The average value of IMTs for those who have undergone surgical intervention fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remain at around 29.
Among those who had undergone the surgery, 36 per cent were completely cured of diabetes and 28 per cent were partially cured.
In the group receiving medication, for comparison, only 1 per cent of the total cure for diabetes was observed, and only about 2 per cent of the total cure.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LNP cholesterol “was generally better in the surgical group”, the authors claim.
Researchers also controlled blood hemoglobin levels of A1c, which reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better kept below 7%, by researchers.
After surgery, average hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8%.
But the best Glycemic control indicators, reflected by good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to Dr. Chi-Chang Soo, research director, and colleagues.
The Study Group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared to the sleeve ghastrectomy group, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg compared to 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in MMT (7.4 to 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 per cent to 2.1 per cent) and was closer to full diabetes remission (46.9 per cent to 16.7 per cent).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment does lead to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone of the College of Medicine in Phoenix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for obesity who chose bariatric intervention, the probability of dying for 15 years was about 29 per cent lower than that of a group with more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this was encouraging for people with IMTs below 35 interested in such a procedure.
“The report is very important here, as it states that such surgery is safe in a group with low IMTs where there is no higher risk of mortality or kidney disease”, she stated.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient's IMT reaches between 27 and 30.
"I think we've waited too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse.
In the Washhouses, the robbers removed coats and 9 million rubles from the house.
In the Washhouses, robbers attacked the residents of the Moscow house and stole 9 million rubles and three women's coats.
Interfax reports this with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown persons entered the house on Gorski Street through an open door, tied up the 20-year-old son of the housewife and, threatening both with a knife, stole 9 million rubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the damage amounted to 9,265,000 roubles, and criminal proceedings were instituted under the heading “Disarmament”.
European fans risk becoming homeless.
Only 23 peterburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to the World Cup in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are still in a hurry to obtain permission.
According to experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to world primacy, the authorities will have to find a way to displace all the guests of the city.
The interviewers of Rosbalt believe that the tournament will increase the rent of rented apartments by 10 to 30 per cent, and after the championship, the rent will have to be overpaid.
The World Cup made the authorities pay attention to the condition of Russian hotels.
According to a law written specifically for the first place, every hotel in Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
Even now, it is clear that not all will be able to do so: hotels are so afraid of testing that they often do not even send documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for Petersburg.
According to UFAS head Vadim Vladimirov, the agency has studied 138 hotels and now plans to start 34 hotel cases, many of which have simply failed to respond to the anti-monoperators.
There are indications that three dozen companies have been deceiving citizens by placing a number of stars in advertising, noting Vladimirov.
The problem is, right now there's literally every number on the table, and no one can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, the fans will occupy all of the Peterburg hotels.
Now, tourists can count on 30,000 rooms in the city.
According to Smolny, there are 17 five-star hotels in Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, and 550 single-star hotels.
According to Nana Gwichia's First Deputy Tourism Development Committee, only 23 hotels have so far been classified, so many checks have been made by companies accredited to Petersburg.
But did a hotel order a similar procedure from regional enterprises, which is surprisingly unknown?
I mean, there may be more classified, but no one knows about it.
"The last six months of hotels did not really want to be classified," acknowledged the director of the Northwest Office of the Russian Tour Industry Union, Catherine Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season, during which hotels make the most money and do not want to do other business.
Another reason is the budgets that did not contain the cost of testing, and the procedure may be used by the hotel depending on the status of 30 to 100,000 roubles or more.
However, hotel managers have recently stepped up and started applying for classification, assured Shadsky.
The hotels have to make it by July 1, 2016, or they will not only pay the fine, but they will also not be allowed to work for the World Cup.
It is already known that depending on the starry, a fixed hotel fee will be developed for the duration of the tournament.
The formulas for which the cost will be calculated will be published next year.
This is done to prevent prices from rising between 200 and 300%, as is the case, for example, during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience, and you don't have to get two or three promotions, but hotels have to get paid.
"I think it'll be up to 50%," explained the president of the Russian hotel association Gennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimirov, in turn, is not sure that price fixing is consistent with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much it fits into economic theory, but I hope it's justifiable.
"It's better than an unbridled journey," he said.
It's not clear what happens to popular cheap hostels.
The deputies of the State had submitted a bill to prohibit hostels in homes.
We very much hope that this law will not be passed or will not be applied to Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that hostels must be preserved," Nana Gavácia believes.
However, according to her, the owners of the mini-hotels should in any case be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma finally approves the bill, some 80 per cent of the hostels will be closed in Petersburg and there are currently 1,500 rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of Restorators and Hotels of the Northwest, Leonid Garbar, there are two and three-star hotels in Petersburg that are needed by football fans, but there are four and five-star hotels.
This situation is similar to the situation where "the 80 thousandth Stadium has 75,000 vips."
It can be fixed at the expense of mini-hotels.
Their possible ban, the expert says, "I think it's strange that there are people who can live in apartments, but people who can't come here for some reason."
If the hostel is used as a dorm, I agree it's wrong.
But if it's like a hotel where guests come for a short time, why not?
Mini hotels risk missing the World Cup because of their slowness.
Hundreds of small hotels will just not be able to get the classification, and they dig a hole for themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be booked.
“Companies that can perform this procedure are not many, so they will give up less paid orders from the mini-hotel, but will choose the ones that are more expensive,” observed Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the rates of the inspections performed are now much higher than those of the Peterburg.
The reason for the Paterburg delay is due, inter alia, to the continuous transition in the Government ' s tourism unit, which does not facilitate smooth operation.
According to experts, if the hotels in Petersburg are not enough, it is likely that attention will have to be paid to the regional hotels and rest homes.
Like the 300th anniversary celebration of Petersburg, the river fleet can be mobilized into the city, so the guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will be prepared to arrive in vans where they can sleep.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels to be empty," I'm sure Gennady Lamshin.
The rental dwelling will also be very popular during the football first season.
It's likely that the city will have a reserve of rental apartments.
The rent will increase by 10-30%.
"Of the obvious, the first to leave a place near the stadium," noted a specialist in the rental of the Agency for Development and Real Estate Research, Larissa Bragin.
However, the rent may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
The construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city would also contribute to this, she stressed.
Let us not forget the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbart is convinced that Petersburg has always been a hospitable city in which people not only point the way but can also conduct a mini tour.
There are complications.
My dad met a family from Murmansk in the yard in 1970, father, mother, and two children.
They had no place to sleep; the hotels were difficult at the time, and it was hard to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," he remembered.
True, he added that there is no such thing left in the city now - calling his home could have consequences and terrible consequences.
But in 2018, after the bad decisions of the State, the mistakes of hotels and governments, maybe you'll have to remember the past.
Girinovsky's "sille" of the Amur region.
I was fascinated to see Girinovsky's clown in the State Duma today.
He did these things when our generation was just learning how to sell newspapers, and it's still in beautiful shape.
The theme of the speech is, like, "LDP protest against the results of the elections in the Amur region".
The protocols do not tremble because there is nothing; there are no protocols other than those signed by the berms, apparently the LDPR.
Here he picks up Ivan Abramov's second place and shouts something like, "Here's the winner of the election!"
And then he's jumping at Rodnine, and then, after a fight with the president, he's taking the faction out of the courtroom, screaming literally, "You're all with the fronts of your crooks and thieves."
The press, of course, does not focus on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insult.
Volfovich actually leaked the Amur region beautifully and elegantly, along with Abramov.
For the whole country, it's another "Podny" Žirinovsky, not a protest by a political party against the results of a particular election.
Both the faction formally scanned, and the elections, according to the party's website and Facebook of Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader of the subject is clearly falling.
Offers the dead in Amura to bury their dead themselves, but he gives the good news to the One Russia in general and to the innocent Rodnina.
It's a fine decision not to lose one's face, not to go to a real scandal.
The other thing is that now Abram himself is in a strange situation.
He didn't wait to hear anything but shouting from his superiors, there's no alternative protocol.
He is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but, on the other hand, for a narrow circle, he is the formal excuse for insulting a respected champion and, even more, the cham attacks against EP and FNF.
And then, of course, he needs to really think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the election, region number two policy and candidate number one for the only district single-member district, it could become a couple that successfully benefited from their own party leadership and super-discipline for the same FNL and party leadership of a stranger.
I'm sure it wouldn't have been Girinovsky, but he should've been made up and watched respectfully.
The trump is still growing and growing to him.
There's news that the LDPR will return to the room during the next prisoner.
So the bath fell for nothing.
Only Abramov's theme was buried under her.
It's really beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama referred to the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Centre in Oxford on ethics research at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that, under the prevailing circumstances, the interests of humanity should be higher than those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while it was admirable, the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria for their response to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“The care of thousands of refugees is excellent, but at the same time you must also think about durable solutions, how to bring true peace and true development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries”, he stressed.
After all, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the US’s strong reaction had triggered a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to the problem was possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have swallowed hand disinfectant in the past 4 years
Toxicological centres in the United States reported an increase of almost 400 per cent since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who had swallowed high-alcohol disinfectant hands, according to Georgia State Toxicology Centre.
According to Dr. Gailord Lopez, director of the Georgia State Toxicology Center, cases of children swallowing up to 12-year-old hands disinfectant fluids reported to the toxicological centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children contact these substances more frequently, and unfortunately some of them go to the E.R.," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant liquid on purpose, and some do it to impress their friends, or to argue for social media.
The YouTube video shows teenagers drinking disinfectant fluids as cheap drinks.
Adolescents reportedly mixed disinfectant fluid with alcohol-containing mouthwashing fluid in order to obtain a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the pleasant smells of disinfectant fluid.
"The child doesn't think it could hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand-disinfectant) are those that are scented.
There are disinfectant hands that smell strawberries, grapes, oranges that are very attractive to children.
The disinfectant hand fluid contains about 45 to 95 per cent of alcohol.
In young children, especially, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"This is a high-concentration alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, Chief Medical Officer at the Kansas University Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave a shot of whiskey, but people keep these hands disinfectant in sight, and if kids get to them, it's a fast way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently swallowed a strawberry scent disinfectant at school, was sent to the E.R. for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who is legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija confused her words and could not walk when she was taken to the E.R.
Doctors watched her all night at a separate child clinic to avoid any signs of brain injury, as the girl fell and hit her head, told Ritchie.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Naiji's mother.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers should use non-pirate substances or disinfectant napkins, in addition to removing disinfectant hand fluids from children ' s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol as a lethal agent, not ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-grade students in North New York conspired to poison their "opposing" teacher by "distribution of antibacterial substances in the classroom", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectors, and she forbids keeping them in her class.
The police consider the failed plan to be "empty talk" and address disciplinary issues to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the end of the children ' s library of N.K. Kruski is saddened by the iron owl.
Kids who come for books are trying to feed her candy.
For several generations, he's been in the library for 95 years.
The earliest readers in the 20th century used to make loud readings here, perform on Mayakovsky’s poems, perform literary quizs and write with Lenin’s wife.
The census lasted four years, and as The Young Staliner wrote in 1939, “the friendship between Hope and the friends of the Barnaula Children's Library became stronger every day.
Constantine’s hope even sent a picture of her child to her distant Barnaul friends once.
And when the Barnauls asked if Hope Constantinovin had any objection to having her name assigned to the library, he said no.
Letters have long been dusted in the museum, and the grandchildren of the first readers have to explain to them whose hard profile decorates the library building.
During the years of restructuring, people often called, resented: Why does the children’s library not change its name?
Let's have a library of the name of some good children's writer, no political coloring!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave it as it was.
"Crumb" is probably the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, as a "Leninka" in Moscow.
There's a yellow brick track on the floor in the library lobby.
"The Wizard of Emerald City" is Oli Moscow's favorite theme.
Olya used to be a law firm manager, came to work at 8:00, left at 5:00, and all the other managers were different from the love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet saying, "I need an illustration for a book."
A little American girl wrote a book called My Cancer Mommy, "My Mom's Cancer."
Olya made illustrations and thought that life could end at any moment, and there would be no miracles in it if you didn't create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, she illustrates children's books of writers all over the world, and she writes stories herself.
Traditionally, it is believed that children lose interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But we have kids who read, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, says "The Russian Planet," the director of Tatiana Cuschvid Library.
In recent years, we've even had such a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed, and it's going to live - the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
There's a large exhibition window in the library lobby with an up-to-date photo display.
Once a quarter, new photographs of readers who go to the library as a family are posted: Mother, Dad, and children.
The library is pleased to see that more and more fathers have come with their children.
At two years of age, the child needs more books when he or she is older.
But now there is a law that prohibits an eight-year-old from issuing 12+ books.
To get a book like this, a child has to bring his parents in -- they come in, then come back again, and gradually "Crumb" becomes something like a family club for them.
There are treasures in the library-- a pre-revolutionary collection of eggs and eras, to lead Coronenko in an annex to the Niwa magazine, a 1936 Murzilka embroidery.
We're not just the conceptual space of the book's temple, we're open to movement right now, we're trying to become a special place -- not home, not work, not school -- Tatiana Kuszvid explains.
You can come to us to read, play, paint.
We've made a playground for the babies - the baby just comes to play, and the hand is still reaching for the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by our parents, and they're stuck with their feet, and they don't want to leave.
Moms often come in with carts -- and we're pleased that they put the library first among all the other places to go with the babies.
Tatiana Kuszvid says that today's children, like we used to, love classical children's literature:
“The publishing business is now evolving, and much attention is being paid to authors, who are the link between generations.”
And when it comes to little babies, it's important that they have some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Kids don't like to break up with their heroes.
The library regularly publishes booklets for parents, describing what is happening in modern children’s literature, what books are worth looking at, and why.
Booklets are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library isn't for them.
It is forbidden for adults to carry books outside the reading room.
Only children have this magical privilege.
...there's a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase in the basement, in the book store.
Steps will be squeaking under your feet, it's a very old time machine.
You're seeing your childhood book like an old friend: hi, it's good that you and I don't change.
Ally's still walking on the track with a yellow brick, the lazy Tola Reddiekov steals magic matches, and Malchish Kibalcish never told the damn Bourgeois of the Secret War-- that's the word he's got.
Books like passwords, you can recognize your own anywhere.
There's real book rares in the vault, like pre-revolutionary collections of eggs and eras.
Or lead Kingenko in a famous app to the Niwa magazine.
Or a 1936 Murzilka embroidery.
Time has aged the pages, painted them in tea.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, and I dream of getting retired and doing rare children's books.
But the kids won't do that, so to speak, and the paints in the old books aren't very bright, and the themes... you open the front page, and there's Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now it's like, why did we all write this Pioneer Truth?
But it was still interesting, says "Russ Planet" Galina Ilyasov, head of the bookshop.
The pages of the Murzilka are getting dark from time to time.
Galina Vasilyevna runs a book store for her entire life.
She knows the color of Buratino's cap, in which school year Harry Potter became captain of the Gryffindor team at the Quidditch Championship, in which situations Carlson uses the engine silencer, and what Alice Seleznov's father works.
The librarian pays little for his work, and everyone who can live without these book rows finds a different profession very quickly.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, educators, religious ministers of the book.
You can also recognize them by smiling -- it's believed to be a professional feature of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation, it's a professional.
I like children's books, as a librarian I like them to be, so they're straight and beautiful on the shelves, and I love to read them, says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical, fairy tales, fantastic.
Reading modern Russian writers, fresh translations...
Of course, I think it was different when I was a kid.
The books were the most exciting and exciting thing that happened to me at the time.
And since I loved them crazyly, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be despite the Riders.
And I'm happy when our former readers bring children or grandchildren...
Rumor mill: There's no disagreement in Celtic.
Griffiths denied the talk of the Celtic dispute after Dale's admission that Hops was in a bad position, but he'll fix it.
Harts will protest against the Scottish Football Association's claim against Neilson, and Warberton fears signing contracts in January that could disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increased the advantage of Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's first-time penalty gave Aberdeen a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittodri, allowing Dons to break off Celtic by five points.
Griffiths denied the conversations about disagreements.
This led to rumours of disagreement at the Celtics, which were suppressed by Griffiths, who claimed that he and his teammates were not suffering from any increased criticism in preparation for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling tension, I think the players want it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots aren't fighting for the title De Boer.
A former paramilitaire from Rangers and former Dutch team member Ronald de Boer claimed that Dutch football fans had lost interest in Celtic because he was not competing for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, the current representative of Ayaxa, said, "In Holland, the most attractive moments of Celtic play no longer appear, why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in Old Company games, and it's not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic was going through a lot of trouble, but the Norwegian coach vowed to make a difference.
The defeat of Malmö and the resulting withdrawal from the League of Champions was soon followed by the loss of 10 Aberdeen football players, who are now at the top of the table by five points.
However, Dale said, "The Silo has had bad periods before, and we're going out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I realize it's very unfortunate, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
So do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need Celtic support, because that makes the players much better.
Staying together is so important right now.
Warberton, with distrust, awaits the January transfers.
Despite the opinions that appeared just a few weeks ago, suggesting that he had identified some of the objectives of the January transfers, Rangers' boss Mark Warberton distrusted the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the unity of the team.
Brentford's former attacker said, "Janwar's transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the season starts to adapt to them, which you saw in our own band this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Michu, who is interested in Celtic, hinted at the end of his career.
Suoncy's attacker Michu, linked to Celtic during the transfer window, suggested he could leave football after his Swan contract ended.
A 29-year-old player suffered from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
The Harts are going to stand up to the SFA about Neilson's statements.
Harts led with a 2:1, when Paterson was removed, and began to play 3:2, but the red defence card was later cancelled; this is the third red Columa card, cancelled in eight months.
Neilson doesn't give up saying, "I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tyncastle.
The hard-working Hibernian player received a reprimand after admitting to singing an insulting song about former Harts player Rudy Skacela.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby on Tyncastle in March 2014.
"It was derby, and it was hot," said the attacker, adding, "I can say with confidence that I wasn't going back to Tyncastle if he wasn't playing for Celtic."
Donnelly: The Tannadis council is confident in the management of Dundee United.
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United Board of Directors is still confident that the management team will make a difference, but agrees that the deterioration in the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the guys out again," said Donnelly.
McInnes is glad that "unattractive" won Hamilton.
Derek McInness admitted that his team, Aberdeen, had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assis to win the seventh consecutive league victory, which put them five points above Celtic, at the top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Rooney's first-time penalty.
McInness said, "There's no team here that wins anything-- a cup, or a league championship, who didn't win meetings like this."
The unemployment rate among Scots does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing.
THE unemployment rate in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher than that in the United Kingdom at 5.5 per cent, as shown by the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people in three months, with 2,612,000 now working.
The employment rate for Scotland dropped to 74.0 per cent a quarter, which is higher than the average of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Minister, David Mandela, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The Government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for strengthening the economy.”
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made its historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the Scottish labour market, with increased employment and reduced unemployment.
Why am I a witness to the execution in Oklahoma?
Today, by avoiding legal intervention at a later stage, I will watch a person be executed.
If that happens and I hope not, I'll be sitting at the death row gallery in Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
This request was first made in January, through a close friend of his, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approached, I became afraid.
So why would you do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story about the death penalty.
That would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since there are often more people than places, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press places was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I'm gonna sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and he and I have a relationship after a few months of phone calls and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk to him.
Prison says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I'm not allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'm gonna have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of tweeting my impartiality.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she could've better spelled it herself, but she still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could cross me off his witness list anytime.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that transparency will help the abolitionist movement.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I wrote down.
I'm not going to go into detail here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip wasn't guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treeze make him guilty of aiding the crime.
But I believe there's a great chance he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that there was not enough evidence for the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that angle, I'm gonna watch him die.
I can't claim to be completely objective.
There will be other reporters who can be consulted for this.
I'll tell you what it's like to watch someone I like die without need.
A man chased by the police was persuaded to get out of the Canning River.
A constable from Canning Vale managed to persuade a man to get out of the Canning River and stay dry.
Perth was about to leave the police, but he couldn't get stuck in dirty water in shallow water a few yards away from a police officer trying to "smartly persuade him to land."
Cunning Vale police were summoned on Tuesday for illegal entry into other people's territory in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them, rushing to Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not going out, come on, grab me," said Sergeant Sgt. Sandell Castledyne.
Constable Lachlan Perhavetsu didn't really want to wet his uniform, so he used a safer technique of "talking with a good cop."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," says Sergeant Sergeant Castledyne.
That's exactly what Ben Cazins' football player remembers.
In 2006, Kazins moved into the quail to avoid meeting a police patrol to test for alcohol, and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but they encouraged the locals to invent a joke "Ben Kazin's Biathlon."
Peter Moody accuses stewards of trying to spy and threatening to leave the horse sport.
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria of trying to infiltrate a spy in his stable last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
He was targeted by stewards and members of Racing Victoria's Ethics Department, who were accused of having organized a campaign against him personally, and the withdrawal of Lady Tatai from the start because of a violation of the rules for the use of drugs on the day of launch, Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he's always making every effort to participate in the races, and he's in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive outcome of the Lydari test on the cobalt, which he can't explain.
He kept his tongue on suspicion of spying for a year and a half and didn't want it to look like green grapes.
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been through it for a long time, but sometimes you're so upset that you're not holding back," said Moody.
They know it's been going on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep tight.
I want to walk with my head up high, and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think it's not, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Moody had been sensational during an interview at racing.com that the ethics department had tried to spy in his stable.
"A half a year ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I'd call if asked, and offered him a job in my stable to give information about what I'm doing in my stable," said Moody at Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all make statements, since they failed to catch me.
Robert Rollston, former president of RVL, David Moody, current president of RVL, and Bernard Sondri, external executive director of RVL, knew about it all the time and now.
Shouldn't that make me think this is becoming personal?
Shouldn't RVL have the courage to hold people accountable for what's happening in this business other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I that bad for this profession?
Maybe people out there think that's what it is.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I don't doubt what I'm saying right now might make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
It really makes me sad.
I will put pressure on them and hold them responsible for the decision.
I have family support, and I can leave.
Coach's resentment only grew during a long investigation into the case of Kobalt and Lidari, and the last withdrawal of the horse from the start made him say that he could "throw his license to the table."
Moody, most famous for training the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the prescriptions for the use of medication on the competition day "smart" after the horse was put on its feet with a compress of clay, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules at the races.
"I must bear full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my employees accidentally put a compress on her leg.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, just like it was.
She was with him the day of the race.
Moody may be disqualified for three months under the rules for the use of medication on the day of compress competition, for which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's gone too far," Moody said.
Driver who attacked and escaped from the Cobrama scene was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobram this weekend and fled the scene.
A motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene of the incident, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic regulations.
A motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobrama, remains stable in the hospital.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, is putting together the charges against the rivals for the use of tough force.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called the criticism of intercepting the ball his team as "an agenda" by the two winners of the NRL championship.
Coach "Sydney Rusters" Trent Robinson stated that the judges allowed Storm to "fight" his team during the sudden victory of "Storm" at the final qualification game in Sydney on Friday night.
Coach Brysbane Broncos Wayne Bennett made a clear hint on the Storm after his team won the final qualification tournament at the Noorse Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called this game "typical" for the rugby league and stated that two of Queensland's team were not "too successful" in a hand-to-hand fight.
Bellamy defended his team's interception of the ball and said they were just focused on the "contact" by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was convinced by the criticism of his team by the two leading coaches, because that means they're worried about the possible defeat of Storm.
"It keeps popping up -- I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about tough moves when they beat us with a score of 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems for a year, just over the past six weeks, we've focused on contacting the ball, and that was a turning point for us.
Trent's been out there for three years, and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football", reminding his teacher that "St. George Illavarra Dragons" Bennett won the 2010 championship, showing "smart" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was," Bellamy observed.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he's got a team that can show what he thinks is an impressive football, especially his young semi-defense men at their speed.
That's the football you'd like to play when you have such players.
He made that observation in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style -- not every team has two semi-protectors like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a little concerned about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm and Rusters game was a match with more points than the Brancos and Cowboys game.
The Brancos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game, it was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, that's an impressive football?
Or do you think breaks and failed attempts are impressive?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, that means we can meet them there at some point.
Storm has a weekend off at the end of this week, as they won the right to receive either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Crownla Sharks next Saturday night at the pre-finals at the AAMI Park Stadium, the tickets will be available for sale next Tuesday morning.
An accused for possession of drugs, the Serbian was released on bail at $200,000.
A man facing life imprisonment for trying to embezzle 40 kg of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released on bail at $200,000.
Marco Maximovich, 29 years old, is one of five people arrested last month after the federal police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on Solay, a South American boat sailing through Vanuatu and mooring in Kumera in August.
Throughout the morning, Maximovich and his associates were seen at the marina, and later he met with them at the Comera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo's car.
Although Maximovich is facing a life sentence for trying to obtain sufficient quantities of drugs for sale, counsel for Maximovich argues that there is no evidence that the latter tried to obtain the entire shipment and that the man could have been in a café without any intent.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has ties with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
The mother and stepfather of Maximovich were offered a joint pledge of $200,000 for his release.
"It's clear from both accounts that the $200,000 bond is too much of a financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan remarked.
But this measure alone is not sufficient as a guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovich was allowed to be released on bail on the condition that he would surrender both his Australian and Serbian passport, report daily to the police and observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsicaris: "I'm proud of the Greek team that fought until the last few seconds."
==History==Fotis Katzikaris, the chief coach of the Greek team, paid tribute to his team after the 1/4 Eurobasket 2015 final match with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was determined by some mistakes.
It was a big game, quotes AFP Katsicaris.
We were preparing for a great Spanish performance game.
We tried to work in defense, but the defense mistakes determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I'll be assigned Kaun's functions at CSKA."
CSK's new recruit Joel Freeland claimed he didn't believe in the curse of the army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroliga next season.
I've spoken to Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, quotes Freeland's R-Sport.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to restructure the center position, but I was more of a forward in the NBA.
Now we're gonna have to fight more against the big center of the rival, but I've done this before, so I think I'm gonna do it right now.
The army won the Euroliga for the last time in 2008.
Since then, they've traveled six times to the Final Four, but they couldn't show their best basketball every time.
There's a feeling someone jinxed the team.
That's the game, you can't win forever.
Of course it's complicated, I understand the frustration of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team right now, and if we show the best we can do, we have a good chance to win the Euro league, I really think so.
I've always wanted to win this title, the Moscows have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the CSKA.
As for the jinx, I'm not a superstitious man and I don't believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then everything is possible.
I don't have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as I can.
Louis Enrique: "To me, the Roma match will be special."
The chief coach of the Barcelonas, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the 1st Tour of the League of Champions with a special sense.
According to the mentor, the face-to-face battle of his current and former team would be far from normal for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique trained the “wolves” during the 2011/12 season, but failed to demonstrate himself to the best in Italy's capital.
I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I gained some experience.
I have a very warm memory with Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not important.
It's important to start in the League of Champions from victory.
The Augustus meeting at the João Gamper Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the nearest match.
I'm expecting the Roma game she showed in series A against Juventus.
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: "The Red-Dar has various options for attacking."
Acting Chief Trainer of Urala, Vadim Scripchenko, in the run-up to the 9th Tour of the Premier League with "Crasnodar", noted the variety of attack schemes of the rival team.
According to the mentor, the bulls have several models of assault in their arsenal.
The contest will take place on 21 September and will begin at 4.30 p.m. Moscow time.
How do we play with the "Crassor," and let's see, the official website of the "Urala" says Scriptchenko.
We've got a whole week ahead of us.
This team has different options for attacking, and it's carrying out its attacks in many ways, while we're not slow, so I think it's gonna be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given the fact that Krasnodar is holding a League of Europe match against the Dortmund "Borussia", we will try to prepare ourselves very well to win.
Rocher Kanyas: "Astana House can take the glasses from anyone."
After the 1st Tour of the League of Champions with the Benfika (0:2), Astrana's half-backer, Roher Kanyas, expressed confidence in the improvement of the quality of his team's game in the future.
According to Hawbek, in their field, the Astanians are able to take points from any opponent.
Even though the match was hard for us, I can say we played well with the official UEFA website of Kanyas's words.
"Benfica" is above class, but in a home game, I think we can count on taking their glasses.
It's pretty real.
But first we need to think about Galatasarea and then atletico.
In home games, we can take the glasses from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: "I'll repeat as many times as I want: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world."
Raphael Benitez, the Chief Trainer of Reala, expressed his satisfaction at the major victory in the 1st Tour of the League of Champions with Shahter (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to Vorward Cristian Ronald, who was the author of three heads.
The match was complicated because "Shutter" knows how to control the ball, and it's the official UEFA website of Benitez's words.
The opponent didn't have many moments, but their counterattacks are always dangerous.
I'm not saying the Real was perfect, but there were plenty of opportunities.
I'm happy we didn't miss the balls and hit four.
Cristiano Ronaldo confirmed his level.
It's the best player in the world, I'll say it all the time.
Jordy Alba: "Cristiano Ronaldo can't match Messi."
Barcelon's advocate, Jordy Alba, believes that no one can compare with his single clubboy Lionel Massey.
According to the Spaniard, forward "Real" to Cristiano Ronaldo can't do that either.
Messi is five heads higher than the others, quotes Le Figaro Alba.
Even Cristiano Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field, things change, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: Barcelona has not only unique styles but also bright identities.
Romana's semi-defense Daniele De Rossi noted the importance of compaction and backup in the game with such a strong rival.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21.45 Moscow time.
Let's remind you, the S.E. will be broadcasting her text.
"Barcelona" is a special rival, a good team with great players, quotes the official UEFA website De Rossi.
It's hard to play with bluegranates because they have not only unique styles but also bright identities.
To keep them, we're gonna have to work around the entire match and back up each other.
The Messiah is almost always successful when he goes into the fold, so we need to maintain compactness and organization.
Yezhov hopes to be part of the SKA start-up match with the Slovene.
The SKA's goalmaker, Ilya Jezov, stressed that he hoped to join the army's start-up team in the next KHL championship.
Jezhov went out on the ice instead of Mikko Coskinen at the 23rd minute at the $0:3 and reflected all the throws at his gate, and the fourth goal was missed after replacing the goalkeeper with a sixth field player.
The next match, the team will take off against Slavana.
I hope I'm going out in the next start-up game, and I'm saying "R-Sport" to Jezov.
I'm not a gatekeeper expert, I'm a gatekeeper, and we don't have any reruns of missing heads, so it's hard to track.
"Dinamo" was a good game, everybody's got a bad game.
The team still lost.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.

Steve Hogg used the girl's phone to get pedophiles to send pictures.
Pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of child abuse.
Steve Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, registered with the Internet message service, where he received a number of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found a missing phone and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She checked him and found shocking pictures, and immediately drew her mother’s attention.
The police arrived and saw five images, then examined the computers found at this address, and found “appropriate” queries in the search engine using words to detect indecent images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done it because it could have "attracted paedophiles," and then he would've pretended to be a policeman to scare them."
The Commissioner of Justice, Aileed Robertson, told the sheriff's court in Dundee: "He claimed it was addiction, he became addicted to frightening people.
He admitted to making inquiries on the computer, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare the paedophiles.
He was interviewed about a conversation with an unknown person who sent him images and about asking for more photos.
He said he was doing it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl discovered the photos on her phone, she called her mother, shaking and crying.
She saw obscene images on her phone, and then a face-to-face bet was made with the defendant.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
Hogg, 23 years old, from Ward Road to Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of making indecent photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating bail terms on 25 January this year and not appearing in court on 24 March this year.
The defendant's lawyer, Gregor Sim, made an application not to include Hogg on the list of sex offenders, since it can be shown that the crime did not have a “significant sexual element”.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael suspended the sentence until October, pending receipt of the social service reports.
Hogg was released on bail in the case, but he was taken into custody prior to the commencement of the hearings in the other remaining cases.
It had been listed as having committed sexual offences even before the sentencing date.
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is reading the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest government leader, fell down the stairs from the podium earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video with the fall scene was instantly spread on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also marred by statements by parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats warning them against whistling Mugabe at the time of the address.
A month ago, they mastered the President during his address to the nation in Parliament; that was the speech Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
A member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, Innocent Gonese, stated that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning Mugabe not to interrupt the speech.
“The report came from a number that is not displayed, but is entitled `Death'”, he informed the journalists at the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned members of Parliament that immunity would end in the House of Parliament, and as soon as they came out, parliamentary immunity would not work.
A member of Parliament stated that the party led by Morgan Tswangirai was “concerned” by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard aims to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its programme to restructure and reduce service costs.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the faster-growing hardware and service sectors.
The estimated reduction in jobs will amount to approximately $2.7 billion, starting from the fourth quarter, as stated in Hewlett-Packard.
“This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise”, said Meg Whitman, President and Director General Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard is now, and the portfolio of business will be broader and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of over US$ 50 billion and “concentrate on the provision of previously unattainable integrated technology solutions”, reported the company's application.
This is how a company formed in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, to produce electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was called the “place of birth of the Silicon Valley”.
Hewlett Packard is in the process of major restructuring to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This HP step, the world’s second personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in the United States, is the latest development in this sector, based on the belief that highly specialized companies are working better.
Captain Mikkel Arteta of the Arsenal says that his fellow clubmen should support the traumatized Jack Wilshire before playing Dinamo Zagreb.
In a conversation with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that it was only September, and that if Wilshire's reconstruction were to proceed according to plan, there would be nothing to prevent him from returning to the Christmas game.
With the most favourable developments, Wilshire will miss exactly at least the next four games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains questionable.
Most often in this recent problem, Wilshire finished the previous season confidently with the only injury to his ankle and was about to return to the usual aggressive style of play during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury is not a threat to his career."
It's just not a complete healed bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It's not about the ankles or the injuries he's had before.
These may be related things from a medical point of view, but as Wenger also admitted, there is a associated risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavourable trend.
According to the Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire suffered 23 different injuries in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he played only 65 of the 157 Arsenal games in the league in the last five seasons.
If you look at the Arsenal scale, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two premier league clubs, on which the most missed days were due to injuries.
Hungarian recognizes the possibility of being stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement of injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you're back in line after an injury, you've been vulnerable for a while -- in that time, you need to regain strength and gain a competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope he recovers physically, I'm sure of it, and I'm sure that his career will be what he deserves.
The Arsenal launches a campaign at the League of Champions on Wednesday with Dinamo Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey didn't come to Croatia, so it's likely that Mathieu Debusi and Arteta will be playing the start-up team.
It is possible that Wenger will also include Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Girou instead of Nacho Morel and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little rest to those players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is an unconditional Favorite in group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most depressing in Europe.
Dinamo hasn't lost any of the 41 games since they were able to spend the last season as "The Invincibles."
On Tuesday night, the stadium was struck by an earthquake with a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Hungarian is confident that Arsenal learned the lesson of last season, when the team was defeated in the Monaco League of Champions game, and remains with little hope to lead the club to the finals of the Champions Cup.
"This is an incredible drive," noted Wenger.
Arsenal has never done this before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm a realist with a history.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: A comedy show that taught us serious lessons in man's friendship
The absence of such stories is striking, especially given how desperate men’s need for frankness has become, now more than ever, while the suicide rate among young men has been at the highest level in 15 years.
In 2013, this was the single largest cause of death among men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more likely than women.
In an effort to address the problem of the Campaign Against Unhappiness, she declared 2015 as the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression revealed that if the patient has enough friends in a normal mood, the chances of recovery are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends halves the chances of mental illness.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all, it needs to be.
In an era where communication is managed by social networks, when style prefers content, the speed of response is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, loving fun and successful, even if loneliness prevails in reality.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values -- money, image, social status, entirely through our inner values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a greater impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire recently pointed out, a video game maker, you don't actually buy any more happiness with money.
The merit of the Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each character was not defined through his own work, but rather through a person who showed himself in association with his friends.
Joey's humour and Chandler's constant hugs, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' sigh for Rachel -- all comes from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As Samaritance said to me, "My role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal, highlights how even the smallest communication of friends can be beneficial."
Often, those men who come to us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old teaching of "live with it" is strong, as is the feeling that a frank conversation about problems can be perceived as weakness."
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the slightest moments of male friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the status of an outsider, who is talking over the phone, helps people in times of despair, while long-term support comes from a close circle of family and friends.
So if you go to FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where you've fully rebuilt the decorations for the holiday, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for a drink.
Or even better, if you see a lonely man in Starbucks, smile and say hi.
You don't have to guess what the benefits of friendship can be.
The Freeds series is shown on Comedy Central from the beginning to the end, all 236 episodes, by the #FriendsFest tag
Dee Maria scores a goal, helping the SVU defeat the Malmö.
Angel di Maria, along with Blaise Mathudy and Edinson Cavanaugh, celebrates full balls at the Malmö gate.
Angel di Maria, debuting at the League of Champions, scored a goal, which allowed SWG to easily pass Malmö on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel de Maria and Edinson Cavanaugh did their job when "Pary St. Germain" began his game at the League of Champions with a very convenient victory of 2:0 against "Malmö" at Park de Prince Stadium on Tuesday.
Dee Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the League of Champions as a PSW player to point out to the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Kavani scored a goal for 61 minutes.
Along with Real Madrid and the Donets' Checker in group A, Pari had to make a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, as they were aiming not at playing-off, but at the continuation of a series of successful games for the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned glasses, but at the same time, it was not the best decision of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovich useless in the attack and later to replace him on the field in a game against a team from his hometown and club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or in the League of Champions, so to win at 2:0, to bring trouble to the opponents, and to play a great part in the defense is a good start, even if there are more things we need to do during the season," said Blan.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, even though I wish we had scored one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovich returned after being injured in one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her a 2-2 tie in a match with the Borodo in the First League on the weekend, but he was pushed to the back of Di Maria for a fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker was noted as a player able to take SVU to a new level in Europe after being bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he ran out of Marco Verratti behind the Malmö defense, and beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball past Johan Willand to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone then expected SVU to win easily and heavily, they had to be disappointed.
The Malmö, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs to reach this stage, with nine world-class players on the field at the beginning of the game, five protectors and two teambacks in the middle of the field, was a serious adversary.
But with the exception of the hit by Nicola Jurdžić, where the ball flew past Kevin Trapp's long pants at the 34th minute, they attacked very little.
At the same time, SVU sometimes failed itself with failed broadcasts and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovich, who in the first half alone was unable to carry out at least five attempts, and then was unable to process the ball that Kavani had beaten as soon as the game resumed.
Nevertheless, he proved to be much more skilled in the exact pastures, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovich, who, Di Maria, had sent the ball with a twisted blow that went in his pants near Viland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour's mark thanks to Kavani, and the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovich set the ball to the center of the field with Maxwell's left flank.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmö had about getting back into the game, and only the interception of the ball by Viland at close range prevented David Louis from increasing the final score before the replacement Esekel Lavessie did not count the goal at the very end of the match.
Coach "Malme" Aghe Hareida later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions took place last December."
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is the wrong level.
Qualifications are not sufficient.
Hail "Pari"!
It was a wonderful match with them.
Glencore earns $2.5 billion to sell shares
The Swiss mining and trading giant Glencore, who suffered from declining commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion to sell shares as part of his ambitious debt reduction plan.
Glencore, a London Stock Exchange company, stated that it had sold some £1.6 billion in new shares to pay off the debt.
A company that lost 57 per cent of its market value is trying to cope with the collapse of commodity prices, while China’s recession is worsening demand and creating chaos in world markets.
With the issuance of new shares at a preferential price, Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange took off on early morning tenders on Wednesday morning.
The stock rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which at opening was 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore launched a $2.5 billion stock sale last week as part of the ambitious plans to reduce its 30 billion-dollar debt by about a third.
The company sold 125 cents apiece of new stock, a discount of 2.4 per cent to the price of closing the tender on Tuesday.
It posted 1.3 billion new shares, representing 9.99 per cent of the company’s statutory capital.
As a result of fears about the continued recession in the Chinese economy, the value of iron ore fell by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials fell by between 20 and 40 per cent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington D.C.
On Tuesday, the White House confirmed in an official report that China's leader Xi Jinping would be arriving with an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit, Sy Qingpin’s first visit to Washington, D.C., will take place on 25 September and will be a follow-up visit to President Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The President and First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, will also receive Xi Jinping and Pan Liuan's wife at a government dinner on the evening of the same day after the two leaders have held bilateral talks.
“The visit of President Xi Jinping will provide an opportunity to enhance cooperation between the US and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, and will allow the Presidents of the United States and China to deal constructively with contentious issues”, says the report.
It is expected that Xi Jinping, whose first visit was announced in February, will stop in Seattle to meet with the leaders of several leading United States technology companies on his way to Washington, D.C., and then go to New York to attend the September UN General Assembly.
Obama and Xi Jingping are expected to discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington’s concerns about alleged cyberspionage by China and China’s growing categoricality on the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

More than 40 orders and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tumen region, Vladimir Yakushev, at a meeting of the Regional Government Presidency.
Some of them related to the allocation of funds to educational and health facilities in the municipalities.
In particular, funds have been allocated for the purchase of a bus for a school in the Nizhenetavdin district and for major repairs to the regional hospital in the Kazan region.
As stated in the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the major repairs to the second floor of the therapeutic unit.
The hot and cold water, drainage, power and electrical installations, ventilation systems, the facade of the building, the renovation of premises and the implementation of a range of fire safety and energy conservation activities will be repaired.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi from 17 to 18 September, with the participation of a Timorese delegation led by the Governor.
The upcoming event in Sochi and the interim outcome of the cooperation are described by the honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tumenia, Vladimir Shuglia, who joined the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what are the objectives of the Sochi Forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on the fruitful cooperation of the regions, the important links between the two States.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, are scheduled to participate in the plenary meeting.
The plenary and sectional sessions will focus on the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in implementing industrial policies, regulations and programmes of the Union State.
The Governor of the Tumen region will address the forum.
I believe that this demonstrates successful, sustained interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also attend.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions will be held, including from the Tumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new contracts and agreements.
I will add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
More than 200 delegates participated, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important cooperation treaty between the Tumen and Minsk regions was signed.
The importance of our work is also reflected in the fact that a meeting of a permanent seminar at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus took place in Tumeni.
In addition, the delegation of the APC of the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in the training of agricultural personnel, to identify additional areas of convergence and to organize new investment projects in the agro-industrial complex.
You've recently met the head of the region and the head of the city's administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the Governor of the Tumen region, Vladimir Yakusev, he spoke of cooperation between the region and the Republic of Belarus in today's difficult circumstances.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be raised; they are needed to reduce the cost of machines to the end-user.
Problems were discussed in the work of the Tumen’s Belshina Commercial House and options for preventing losses.
The issues were important, as investment projects should work clearly and profit the region.
Reference was made to the continued supply of UAO passenger and cargo equipment “MAZ”, the development of the UAO service centre “MAZ”, which was established in Tumeni, based in the UAO “TPAT”.
The discussion also referred to the preparation of a visit by the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus before the end of the year.
Another theme of the interview was the finalization and signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technological and cultural cooperation between the Tumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relationships promise to rise to a new level.
These questions also concerned the regional centre.
During our meeting with the head of the city of Tumene, Alexander Moor, we talked about updating the Tumen bus park.
Around 100 buses are already breathing on ladane, so a new shipment of cars from Belarus is required to operate on gas, clean fuels.
Another aspect: The Tumen elevator factory cooperates with one of the leading elevator manufacturers of the UAO "Mogileviftmash" by receiving components.
In my view, this activity could be more active, given the new elevators programme at the regional centre.
I will add that, within the framework of the consul ' s expanded powers, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan region, Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increased trade and supply of modern Belarusian technology in Zauralya was discussed.
A meeting with the Omi Governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The extended consular district includes five constituents of the Russian Federation, but Tumen is a district headquarters.
The region is a platform for many promising projects, including the work of the honorary gendarme.
Generally speaking, such meetings are meaningful and good in order to address many problems directly and quickly, reducing their urgency and promoting mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the present circumstances, it is essential not to destroy the damage by continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon doesn't want to focus on the ethnic diversity of people involved in film production.
Matt Damon argued with the African-American producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that there was no need to consider ethnic composition.
During the Sunday release of Project Greenlight on HBO, a famous actor interrupted Brown when she tried to highlight the need for alternative views on the main black character in the project scenario.
"Many things are appropriate when you cast for the film itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
Crazy Brown, not believing her ears, exclaimed "Wow, wow, come on, come on" all the time, while the actor from "Marsian" gave comments live.
For finalists, Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and Farelli's brothers to discuss the finalists.
"I'd like the participants -- no matter who the director is -- to think about the way they're going to interpret Harmony's image," said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute beaten by a white pimp.
The producer of the film, Dear White People, advocated that Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio become film directors; Damon was strongly opposed to saying that "we may not get what we want in the end."
After this discussion was broadcast on television, social media exploded with disapproval of Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni was angry about the video: "Explanation of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in the room that hurts so much."
The tweet scored over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s comments appear at a time when the most pressing issue on the agenda of public debate is the literate coverage of race in the media.
After a youth named Michael Brown was shot by a policeman in 2014, Black Lives Matter became popular throughout the country, calling on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against coloured populations.
In February, singer Prince referred to this movement during the nomination of the "Album of the Year" at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Most recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News staff member Elizabeth Hasselbek as to whether the group would be treated as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," reported the movement's leaders.
It was recently announced that Damon was on the list of show business leaders, producers and media magnets invited to visit the Pope of Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
We don't know if the actor accepted the invitation and met the Pope.
American Ninja Warrior awards the first champion
A professional climber and waiter named Isaac Caldiero was the first winner of "American Ninja Warrior" on Monday night, taking home the $1 million prize.
At this sporting show, which just ended its seventh season, none of the participants have ever been able to complete all the stages of the road with obstacles.
In the finals of the season, two participants, Caldiero and operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included a 75-foot rope rise in 30 seconds.
Brittann was the first to do his job and did his job at a given time, becoming the first athlete in the history of American Ninja Warrior, which passed through the exhausting phase 4, but Caldiero did the job three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After winning with enormous effort, Caldiero, who was shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview with E!News.
"It's incredible to think about it, because I've never earned or lived for more than $10,000 a year," said Isaac to E’s reporters! such a serious hike in my income.
And then all of a sudden... I never imagined what it was like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed met with the journalists of The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the final and why Brittany, who first passed the highway, would not get any money prizes.
According to the rules, the money gets the fastest bidder.
"If the finishing players are more than one, the prize gets the fastest of them," said Weed.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes life, it still enjoys great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels offended about it.
He's happy with what he did.
He's got tons of thrilled fan reviews.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "if I was meant to lose, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we switched roles.
"America Ninja Warrior" will come back with the eighth season, which will be released in the spring of 2016.
"Detroth Tigers" quietly walk around Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers are now in the last position in the American League's Central Division.
Pretending to be an obstacle, the Tigers won the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with a total of 5-4 on the Targetfield.
The Twins missed the chance to cut half a game behind Houston Astros and take second place in playoffs after the winners.
For the Detroiters, even for one night, it was a return of the word to the letter F, which slipped away most of the second half of the season.
"All winnings are fun, no matter how they work," said the manager of the Tigers, Brad Osmus.
Pitcher "Tagers" Alfredo Simon made his contribution to support the attacks, resulting in Detroit gaining three points in the first two innings, then adding another one in the sixth and the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third high-quality start in nine exits.
"I just want to end the year with good numbers," said Simon.
Pitchers can't replace each game, so I want to go deeper into the game.
Victor Martinez, the designated beater of the Tigers, was able to counter three blows and sustained two wounds, the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three hits since four hits against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well with a bat," said Osmus.
He's been good at (batter quality), noticeably better at batting, and he's kept that quality for the game.
After three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance to get back in the game.
The central receiver, Byron Baxton, opened an inning doll on the left side of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, making the Bant, took the first base, and second baseman Brian Dozier got a strike out at Simon's swing before his place was taken by left-hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy beat Moira, the only player on the way, before Miguel Sano's new appointed fighter, who hit a two-track single to the left of right-hand Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of earlys not in the out and a comparison wound at Ver Hagen second base, he managed to get Trevor Pluff's third bassman to hit the dobbles.
It was the 27th time for a top league player this season, when Pluff hit the ball on a double-player.
After Detroit added the insurable wounds in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned RBI a "double" in the space between the outfillers against Bruce Rondon's "Tagers" closing pitcher, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-hand player beat Sano after three strikes and received his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of the temporary non-practice Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
The Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher who was on the list of injured until the game itself, missing for more than a month due to the inflammation of his lumbar.
"Surely not the start I'd like," Hughes said, "but as the game developed, I became more comfortable and so I was able to make some pretty good shots in the third inning."
After the first batter hit the first base, Hughes left the single to Ian Kinsler.
Wok at two Rhythfielder outlets, J. D. Martinez, led Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first injury in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his "0 for 21" series with the earlys in an effective position.
The third base player, Nick Castellanos, followed by a single, causing another wound, but Victor Martinez was beaten in an attempt to get closer to the third base, thus eliminating the threat.
The Taigers increased the score in the second inning, getting a one-off "dable" from catcher James McCann and a double-out single from the central beater Anthony Gows, and that's 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said the manager "Twins" Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got right to the right point.
Hughes, whose throws were believed to have been thrown in an unattainable third inning, was replaced by a right-hand relier, A. J. Ahter.
Hughes got three wounds for six hits and four-strike-out wooks.
NOTES: The right-hand Pitcher "Taigers" Anibal Sánchez retired from the players due to the right shoulder tensile.
He's going to be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed a shoulder surgery on Sanchez as early as 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the trauma list since mid-August, is scheduled to start on Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, the left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the trauma list and turn up against the Twins.
Norris, who graduated from the Tigers at four launches since it was acquired in exchange for David Price's left-hand pitcher on July 30, has one victory and one defeat.
He hasn't played since August 20, because of the spraining muscle.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish a series of three games at the Targetfield on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play pitcher right-hand Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
Kadyrov's original complaint for the book "Molba to God" went to the South Sakhalin Court.
The South Sakhalin City Court received the original appeal from the representative of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadjirov, against the decision to recognize as “extremist material” the book Molba to God: Its significance and place in Islam, reports Interfax, referring to the chairman of the mountainous Alexander Chuhrai.
The Court is now awaiting possible objections from the participants in the trial.
Chuhray refused to comment on the statements made by some members of the State Duma of the Russian Federation to test the mountainous for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIL.
"Let them comment on such foolishness themselves," he said.
On 11 September, the South Sahara City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against Judge Natalia Perchenko's decision to recognize the book as “extremist material”.
An appeal came from the South Sakhalinsk Prosecutor's Office on Friday night.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they have asked the court to declare extremist only the opinion of the author of the book, not the verses of the Koran.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the judge made the wrong decision,” Chuhrai reported.
The decision to recognize the book as “extremist material” was taken on 12 August 2015.
In particular, “extremist” quotes from the Koran, “We worship you, and we call upon You for help,” and “Do not call upon anyone besides Allah.”
Knights called the decision makers on the book "Shaitans and Provocators".
He called on the deputies of the State Duma to prohibit by law judicial decisions relating to the texts of the sacred writings.
“I firmly believe that the State Duma must enact a law which prohibits judicial decisions relating directly to the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures”, Cadyrov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments insulting migrants and refugees
Facebook staff intend to remove posts and comments that have a negative impact on migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect complaints from users about illegal content.
The Facebook leadership, together with the German Ministry of Justice, intends to combat xenophobia and racism online.
For example, the previous day, the head of Haiko Maas said that the Ministry of Justice was currently working with social media professionals to establish a special group of moderators.
Participants are required to monitor and remove comments that are incorrect to migrants and refugees.
According to Hayko Maasa, it is assumed that the authors of the non-tolerant posts would receive notices indicating the reason for their deletion.
Organizations whose expertise collects complaints from social media users about abusive posts should also facilitate the rapid blocking of unlawful content.
Facebook intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts that were negative to migrants and refugees, the management of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice had been taken after xenophobic sentiments had surged in the German segment of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for this was the unprecedented migration crisis that affected the EU countries some time ago.
For example, Germany is already overcrowded with all the places intended for refugee accommodation.
On the eve of the day, the authorities decided to temporarily relocate migrants in the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
The internally displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks in which prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
There will be relaxation zones in Moscow cemeteries.
In the near future, several capital cemeteries are equipped with specialized relaxation and psychological relaxation zones.
The first will be the Booth, Domodedi and Shcherbin Cemetery.
The first area for psychological recreation has already appeared at the Troekur Cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, such areas will be found in other parts of the city.
This portal was described by Artem Ekimov, the head of the State Budget Institution, Ritual.
The relaxation zones will be small green areas similar to parks.
According to experts, in such corners, cemeteries visitors will be able to rest, be alone and regain psychological strength.
The relaxation zones will soon be built in Domodedovsky, Butovsky and Shcherbinski cemeteries and then in other parts of the capital.
According to the Ritual head of the GBU, if the cemetery has to be expanded, the builders will try to keep the existing forest areas as large as possible.
Green plantations will serve as a living fence that separates the areas of rest and the areas designated directly for burial.
The Ritual experts of GBU also indicated their intention to propose the removal of hedges at burial sites.
New cemeteries can indeed become barren.
In addition, in the Ritual GBU, the willingness to install electronic terminals to enable visitors to obtain GPS coordinates and burial plates was announced.
In June of this year, Ritual also proposed that the cost of burial services should be adjusted according to the time of the year.
So digging a grave in summer time will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in winter, when the land is frozen.
Note that in the past year the cost of all ritual services has on average increased by 10 per cent.
Five days later, a lost fungi was found in the forest.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without food.
The rescue team and volunteers have been able to locate the mountain fluster.
Alexander Pannikov, correspondent: "A 79-year-old pensioner from Tambov oblast spent five days in the woods."
No food or water.
He was wanted by relatives, rescue workers, volunteers.
There were even movie writers with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was found after the helicopter was involved in the search.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the woods to pick up the omens and the submersibles, but did not return by evening.
The family immediately sought help, and the following day, rescue workers and interested people from a nearby village — only about 30 people — were raised to search for a mushroom.
A helicopter from the Fire and Rescue Centre joined them for the fifth day.
Andrey Seletkov, chief of the search and rescue team of the Smolensk District Fire and Rescue Center, said, "The helicopter was engaged, a man was found."
He's gone very far, completely elsewhere.
That was about 12 kilometers from the search site.
He went a long distance at his age.
It was a miracle to live.
Grybnik was taken to the county central district hospital unconscious, in extremely difficult condition.
He was diagnosed with pneumonia as well as severe dehydration and overcooling.
As an elderly man was able to survive after five days in the woods, doctors have no idea.
Valentina Nepsha, head of the therapeutic department of the Valninian CRB: "Personal screening, treatment."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Given all his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, and it's still hard, but it's positive.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovich arrives every year in Smolenczyna from Tambov oblast.
His grandson says his grandfather used to pick mushrooms, but he never went far into the woods.
Alexei Spitchenko, grandson of the found fungus, said, "Fores are not far from the road, they're not from here."
I've been visiting my family for a few years.
So I went to get the mushrooms.
He must have gone a little far and lost himself.
With the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all parts of the Smolen region.
In the last few days alone, there have been five similar cases.
Squads remind us that we need to walk into the woods in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches, and compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave traces behind so that you can return.
Emergency An-2 sat on the sidelines of a brother's taiga.
Right in the middle of an emergency AN-2 in Siberia.
An emergency landing was made by Enicei, a Redyar airliner, 68 kilometres from Bratsk.
There were no casualties, but the aircraft itself suffered significant damage upon landing.
An-2 was on a service flight.
It had three crew members on board, a commander, a co-pilot and a flight mechanic, reporting Interfax.
The crash aircraft flew along the route of Irongorsk-Ilimsk-Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The aircraft crew has already arrived in Bratsk.
The Brother Transport Attorney's Office, following the emergency landing of An-2, began to verify compliance with the aviation safety legislation.
An investigation team from the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor ' s Office travelled to the scene of the incident.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed their aircraft with passengers due to a technical malfunction at an abandoned secret airfield in Komi.
Engines and on-board electronics failed on the ship, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured in an emergency landing.
West Economics Nobel laureate: globalization
The process of globalization should have helped to reduce inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, and the income gap in the developing economies is increasing.
Eric Muskin.
In order to remedy this, the education of low-skilled workers needs to be improved, according to the Chief Researcher of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of the INE, the 2007 Nobel Prize Laureate for Economics, Eric Maskin.
In the last twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Proponents of globalization predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true in many ways," stressed Muskin.
For example, China and India have experienced a major growth in GDP per capita.
However, not all things are so cheerful.
Globalization was expected to narrow the gap between the “poor” and the “poor” in poor countries, which was manifested in large income inequality and, more precisely, pay.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Muskin in his article “Why global markets have not reduced inequality in emerging economies”, published in The World Bank Economic Review, which has been translated and quoted by INE.
Together with economist Professor Michael Kremer of Harvard University, Erik Muskin has developed an alternative theory that shows why income differentials in poor countries are increasing as globalization grows, similar to the INE of the EME.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin identifies four levels of skills - A and B for rich countries, C and D for the poor.
After globalization, D professionals from poor countries lack the skills to work with experts A and B from rich countries.
And if workers at level C from poor countries are growing because of the cooperation with employees at level B from rich countries, workers at level D are not feeling growth, or their wages are falling altogether.
The overall effect is that the internationalization of production will contribute to widening the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thereby to increasing inequality.
Kremer and E. Muskin are offered an amazingly beautiful model, alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality,” says Fouad Alesserov, a regular professor in charge of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Solutions, and the head of the Department of Mathematics of the World Wide Web.
And as any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a spike of empirical work in this area.
The solution, according to Eric Muskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, according to the scientist, do not have the means to do so, and companies are not in a position to pay for their training.
Governments, international agencies, NCBs and private foundations can play a significant role in such a situation, according to Maskin.
The scientist notes that the theory that has been developed does not in any way call for a halt to the globalization process, which has produced and has borne fruit in the form of GDP growth in countries.
Durbent: The living bond of time.
Derbent, one of Russia’s oldest cities, celebrates its 2000th anniversary in September.
In the holiday programme, the Dagestan National Cultures Festival and the ancient fair, the Derbent carpet exhibition and the Open Temple Day, the Historical and Musical Show "2000 in Two Hours" and the guided tour to the rebuilt Petra I Museum.
The medieval stones of the fortress of Naryn-Kala, the ancient Arab inscriptions on the walls, the narrow streets and palace gardens, all of which have come from the pages of "The Thousands and One Night."
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has been in its place since ancient times.
Although he was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantine, the Hazar Caganate and the Golden Horde.
The age of the eastern platen, which grows in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mechets, is a few centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian programme “Dreasures — Wildlife Monuments”.
The shadow of scattered crowns save pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
Accommodating tea will be given to the mosque visitor and adorned with Dagestan snacks, such as honey figs, hurma, mushulah, petals, ayrans and candy.
In Derbent, they have used large samavages to drink tea at one time.
The inscription above the entrance to Juma's sword says the building was built in 115H.
It's 733 on the Gregorian calendar.
It's the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is astonished by the breadth and solemnity of the arcades of the domes and roofs, which are based on square columns and illuminated by the light of the sun from tiny windows.
The maintenance and breeding of pigeons is a traditional passion for the people of Derbent.
Homebird owners put pigeons in the yards, under the trees, in attics.
An exciting sight is the rise in the sky of a pack of white pigeons that look like the flares of the holiday fireworks.
For defence against the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian gate with a double stone wall.
As it traveled 500 metres into the sea, the building locked Derbent Harbor.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the most well preserved monument of the ancient fortification building.
The carpets in Derbent were weaving in the fifth century, and until now the technology of this unique craft has remained virtually unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for any flavour - wool, cotton, or bark of all colors and shades, with a vortex and without it, with a complex design and a fancy high.
The building of the city began with the malls — blocks with single - floor stone buildings.
Over the years, the malls have barely changed.
Only satellite plates, air conditioners on walls, and street lights remind us that you are not in the Middle Ages but in today’s city.
In the old part of the city, there are parts of the plumbing built by the Persians about a thousand years ago.
Today, ancient sources of water are still being collected by locals.
Many Derbents prefer conventional water from cranes from proven historical fountains.
There was a pottery center in Derbent.
Powdering and signing vases, dishes, jars, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
The pottery’s hands are still producing excellent ceramic products for both practical and souvenir purposes.
On holiday days and festivals, crowds gather under a stretched cane at which students of the Republican School of Circulatory Art are present.
The history of amazing and risky skill has been for centuries.
The new trend is that girls are increasingly visible among the clutches.
There's a museum called "Culture and the Home of Ancient Derbent" in the ex-girlfriend's bath room today.
In the past, single girls and brides were bathed here accompanied by girlfriends, and now anyone who wants to see a cottage hall, hot and cold pools that have gone to the past bathing appetizers.
Most Derbent houses have hot water, but baths and steamers are as popular as they were in the old days.
The use of ferrying is written in ancient books.
After bathing, blood improves, muscles become tired, and the body becomes flexible and easy.
The Communion festival, which is held in the Naryn Kala fortress, is attended by the ethno-domestic suburbs of many parts of Dagestan.
The participants in the national costumes dance, play folk tunes, sing the songs of the people of the Caucasus, and treat visitors with tasty home cheese.
The kirchlar is the site of the burial of 40 martyrs who have put their heads behind Islam.
This is one of the most respected complexes for North Caucasus Muslims.
The yellow sarcophagus have been carved from whole stone blocks and are, as Arabs have said, oriented on the west-east axis.
The Gavrill and Albert Yakubov brothers cut and shave clients in a small salon near the Upper Market.
The barbershop has been in this place for years.
The receptions of the circulatory craft are passed from generation to generation.
Yet, the Yakubova brothers can do not only traditional but also modern hair.
On one of the streets of the Old City, there was a house in which the exiled decabrist Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky lived.
After learning Turkic and collecting ethnographic material, he described Derbent of the first third of the 19th century with his ancient monuments, his life, and the home of the citizens.
Teyhana is a traditional East club where only tea and homemade bakes are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, talk to friends, and solve some work problems.
As in the past, women are not encouraged to cross the threshold of the teahouse.
The Derbent dance band "Caspius" was created three years ago, but it was already possible to take part in the Republican and Russian-level events.
The Ensemble Solists rehearse every day, perfecting the people's Awar, Dargin, Tatian, Armenian dances.
As the evening approaches, when noise and street lights come to light, the locals sit on berries near homes with terraces.
The Derbents usually discuss household matters.
But in the run-up to the anniversary, they are increasingly reminiscent of episodes of the unique history of their city, which has affected the fate of the entire Black Sea and Caspian region.
There was a business airport game in Domodedodev.
The capital is experiencing a new form of education.
Four hundred students tried themselves as airport staff.
For this, the models of three aircraft harbours were installed in Domodedov.
Young people not only searched and registered passengers but also served planes.
It's all in the form of a business game, but the complexity of it has not given way to reality.
Late flights, two passengers with fractures on board, the stairs were lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For a real airport, hell.
For the one who settled in Domodedonov's hangar, the standard set of tasks to be done by newcomers.
In one hangar, three major airports from all over the world were located at once.
Today, there are four hundred students from capital colleges and universities.
It's an unprecedented opportunity to learn everything about the inner world of the airline.
Passenger registration, aircraft maintenance, baggage traffic - even buses on the airfield, stairs and passenger searches were entrusted to them.
And the passengers are a lot of trouble.
One had a problem with the documents, the other missed the flight, the other filled the bag with suspicious items.
And you have to deal with it like in life, in minimum time.
For each of these tasks, they are paid a certain amount, virtual funds, as if they had been paid by the airline for the maintenance of the flight.
“They are charged with a fine for failing to perform the tasks,” explains the Financial Analyst of the game, Dmitri Hilko, in an interview with Vesti-Moscow.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are following the matter closely.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try out a new form of study.
She's already found a place in high-level vocational education.
“Six interregional centres of competence will be formed, which will essentially become new models for the activities of modern colleges with modern management systems, with highly qualified staff, with modern equipment”, says Natalia Zolotaryev, Director of the Department of State Policy in the area of training of workers and additional professional education of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The students, however, don't have global plans.
After three days of training, they seem to need a day off.
At the same time, the grades for the examination were quite material.
The newest smarts, the best I've ever seen!
"I received them for responding in a timely manner to our claim to our airport at Instagram" -- satisfied with the player, the PR manager of the Frankfurt Airport team, Sergey Shuvalov.
The best judges, called pencils, were taken to invite them to work by the time they finished their studies.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia deplored the closure of the library ' s foreign literature of the American Centre.
The Centre worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the Russian government's unilateral decision to close down the American Embassy Center at the M.I. Rudomino State Library in Moscow.
“The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation recently call into question the commitment of the Russian Government to the ties between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been interrupted even during the cold war and at other difficult moments of the long history of our relations,” says Ambassador John Tefft of the United States to Interfax.
The American Centre has created deep and strong links between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital and served as a venue for meetings with numerous American eminent personalities, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Only last year, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and received more than 50,000 Russian visitors”, stressed the diplomat.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, the FLEX Educational Exchange Program.
The Green Tribunal was quick to kill.
Typical situation: Four officials stand before Judge Swattanter Kumar's table, hearing his claims about the work done.
The court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order to make fun of it, Kumar says.
If there's one more brick, we'll order you to take down all the existing buildings.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial authority established in 2010 to halt the rapid pollution of the environment, which has accompanied the booming economic growth of recent decades.
During that time, the Tribunal had heard more than 10,000 claims relating to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop the construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: India has become one of the world’s most overcrowded and polluted countries in the 60 years since independence of enhanced industrial development.
The problem is particularly acute in large mega-cities, where infrastructure development has not kept pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and few remaining housing areas are being cut off for new residential neighbourhoods.
Despite the formal support of the State for the green movement, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it is often the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
For example, in May this year the Minister of the Environment called the court's decisions “extreme” and “implementable”.
Sometimes it is indeed impossible to execute court decisions within the time limit set by the court, as confirmed by environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani.
However, impossible defaults have a positive side: at least they make responsible persons move.
"His main purpose is to shake this system," adds counsel.
The Green Tribunal has already repeatedly cancelled major structures: its account for the cessation of the construction of airports, power plants and hundreds of smaller facilities.
People are also being tried to keep in mind: for example, during a discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagnan State, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we're responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," Kumar commented on his decision.
Such explanations, however, are far from always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can be changed by a single pen.
For example, in April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, causing public outrage.
Despite a sharp decline in popularity and criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to overturn this decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Government of New Delhi on vehicles entering and leaving, and offered to purchase 10,000 additional buses, before they found out at the factories whether they were in a position to carry out such an order.
As sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even road incidents began to come to the attention of the courts, popular anger began to subside.
But the most sick subject of the principled judge was the Ganges River Clean-up Programme, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to Ganga, a river sacred to Hindus, a judge often stops holding back his emotions and turns to screaming.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water from Ganges on the statue of God, and there were feces in it, and the judge was hot.
You keep contaminating the river because you think Ganges is Ganges, he'll take away all our sins.
This is the river we worship, and look what you do to it every day.
The clean-up of Ganga is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new Government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river is more than 120 times the norm.
Each year, between 1.5 and 3 of the 700 million Hindus bathing in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Ganga Rescue Fund from the sale of his suit, where he met Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
The ecologists immediately accused the premier of populism: the suit was purchased for $700,000, while the river requires at least eight billion to clean up.
The supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India still has a long way to go before it can claim to be a developed country, but they do not believe that the cost of progress should be ecology.
"In a developing country, the talk of the environment is often perceived as an unacceptable luxury," says the activist "Ganga Zul" Malik Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a golden balance between ecology and development."
A man blooded several Dali paintings at an exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the exhibition of the Latvian Artists Union in Riga broke windows in the museum and destroyed El Salvador Dali's sculpture of the "An angel's appearance."
The museum now has an exhibition of works by El Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
A man born in 1985 entered the sculpture room at 2:20 p.m.
He immediately misled, ruined the sculpture, smashed the windows.
He then began moving through the premises and stained several works of permanent exhibition.
Among them is a portrait of the hand of Myerwaldis Polis.
According to the President of the Latvian Union of Artists Igor Dobchin, referred to by Interfax, the windows were also corrupted.
Police and art experts work at the scene.
The latter determine the extent of damage and damage.
A criminal case of hooliganism had been brought against the man.
The Latvian Union of Artists held an exhibition of works by Picasso and Dali from 4 August to 27 September, where more than 200 original works by artists were presented.
Commentator Gennady Orlov is hospitalized in Spain.
On Wednesday, Russia's Zenith champion from St. Petersburg will hold his first team match of the League of Champions with Spanish Valencia.
Unfortunately, the peterburg game won't be able to comment on Gennady Orlov.

The survey will answer whether the 70-year-old Gennady Sergeyevich needs rapid treatment.
Constantine Genich will comment on the match.
Zenith is a member of the League of Champions.
His rivals are the Spanish Valencia, French Lyon and Belgian Gent.

Xi Jinping calls for a more open economy for the world
The economy must become more open to the world to boost its growth, as President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in his address to the group facing the challenge of managing the reforms.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop a policy of openness”, he said, addressing participants at the 16th meeting of the Central Lead Group Committee on the Comprehensive Deepening of Reforms.
He said that greater openness and deeper reforms would give the economy new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group has adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of market access regulations for investors, the modification of border controls, the promotion of public enterprises (SOE) that attract private capital and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of economic and production sectors that are not available for investment would be drawn up.
The system will be gradually re-engineered through pilot programmes.
This is an important step because it will give the market a more meaningful role in resource allocation, business rule and openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government would also weaken its control over the powers granted to companies, thereby guaranteeing that companies would run their own businesses.
The statement also stated that China would allow border regions to develop new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to enhance local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of government-controlled sectors of economies.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-financed companies and provide them with better conditions”, states the statement.
The procedure for applying for permanent residence permits for foreigners, or “green card”, will be further facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to an official report issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Lee Keqiang and Ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli were also present.
