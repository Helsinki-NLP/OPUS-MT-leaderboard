White pawn on f3, black pawn on e6, white pawn on g4, black queen on h4-mat! in chess circles, it's called a fool's mat.
White: a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: pawns on a7 and b7; king on a8; elephant on b8. Whites put their opponent in the position of tsuckwang, placing them on a6, and then blacks have only two options: to take a torch on a6 or to move an elephant to any other diagonal field b8-h2. In the first case, whites move a pawn from b6 to b7 and put a mat. In the second case, white torch takes a black pawn on a7 with the same result.
