In Kineshma and the district, two men committed suicide.
Earlier, one of the hangers had already attempted suicide.
On 30 October, about 1 a.m., in Lugovoi village, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
It is known that he had previously attempted suicide.
Which prompted a man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, 11-50, a 41-year-old man, living in Kineshma, died as a resident.
No signs of violent death were found, reports the Ministry of Internal Affairs press service “Kineshimski”.
A black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the collapsed highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box carefully installed on the dashboard of your car.
These devices, which track each passing mile and convey this information to officials, are at the centre of a debated attempt to upgrade the outdated American highway finance system undertaken by the planning bodies of Washington and the state.
Normally, the boring stage of motorway planning has suddenly generated intense debate and colorful alliance.
The Liberians joined environmental groups in lobbying for the government's right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you pass, and perhaps even where you pass them, and then to use this information in the collection of tax accounts.
The Tea Party is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about privacy.
And although the convention has not yet been able to agree whether or not to proceed, several states are not going to wait.
They are thinking about how to move on to a system in which drivers pay for every mile of the road they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
“This is not a matter on which we may have the right to choose,” said Hasan Irrata, Executive Director of the Southern California Association of Government, who plans to start tracking the state’s miles passing by every Californian motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
Technology is already available for this.
This is compounded by the lack of funding from the Government Roads Foundation, which is financed by taxes paid by Americans on gas stations.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
The cars drive more than a mile per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents a gallon, has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise taxes on even one cent at high fuel prices.
"The fuel tax is simply impossible to keep," said Lee Mannick, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices had recently been installed to test the pay-as-you-go system.
"It will be the best alternative in the long run," he said.
Nerds call it the wrong user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberators, as taxes can change the nature of travel in order to reduce road loads and emissions of greenhouse gases, for example.
Planners in California are looking into this system in the process of developing strategies to meet the targets set by the state's ambitious global warming laws.
However, a member of the House of Representatives, Bill Schuester (Republican, Pennsylvania), President of the Transport Committee of the Chamber, said that he also considered the system to be the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market participants at the Reason Foundation are also excited to make drivers pay for every mile.
"It's not just a tax that's going to go to a black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-Political President Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former US Transport Ministers, who in 2011 called upon the Congress to move towards a false payment.
The US senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, with about 10,000 cars participating.
However, House leaders rejected this proposal because of the fears of rural voters, who often have to travel miles in their daily lives to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is shown in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state a mile instead of a fuel tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It's under consideration in New York.
Illinois will try it on a limited basis with the lorries involved.
And the I-95, which includes the Transport Departments of the 17 States of the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers had recently been equipped with these devices, the drivers were concerned that the government could monitor their every move.
“The concern about the big brother and such things is a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who runs strategy and performance management in the Nevada Transport Department.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the trials were under way, the U.S. Civil Liberties Unit in Nevada warned on its website, "It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices."
There is no need to create a huge, heavy technology infrastructure that will necessarily be expanded to keep records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states in which a difficult search for low-cost technology is under way that would allow state governments to take into account the miles passed by the car, but without information about place and time.
If you can do that, said the Khan, society will feel more calm.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small, young company in California called True Media.
Originally, this company did not assist in collecting state taxes.
It sought to enter the developing market of a type of motor insurance, in which drivers paid on a mileage basis.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically downloaded using a modem.
"People will be more inclined to do so unless you track their speed and location," said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Mediage.
There were some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less obsessive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with providing drivers with different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely abandon the device by choosing instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all the citizens of the state are passing through.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea to a cautious public, making devices do more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are attempting to develop a tax scheme that will also accept parking counter payments, provide “pays as you drive” insurance and collect a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers who could use to avoid traffic.
“Vehicle users will be attracted by the benefits offered to them,” says the urban design document.
Some transport designers, however, are wondering whether all conversations about false payment are simply a huge distraction.
In the San Francisco Bay City Transport Commission, officials say that a convention could easily overcome the bankruptcy of a trust fund for the construction of highways by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be charged to hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles do not use much fuel to pay their fair share.
"There's no need for radical surgery when all you have to do is take aspirin," said Randi Rentschler, director of the Law and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
EU prepares support measures for Ukraine in the event of Russian economic pressure
The European Union has a back-up plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as an agreement with the IMF on emergency credit if Russia takes any action in response to a possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
A stand-by loan is under negotiation with the IMF, and another EU official directly involved in the talks added that their goal is to conclude an agreement soon.
However, in addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine could receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
The analysts surveyed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF can overcome long-standing differences about funding conditions.
Nor does the international rating agency S&P, which reduced Ukraine's sovereign rating by one step to a "B-" with a "B," on Friday.
However, EU representatives say that the IMF can show flexibility under credit conditions, taking into account Ukraine's circumstances.
In addition to the country's financial support plan, the EU has a backup option to supply Ukraine with gas, the bulk of which is now coming from Russia.
It's probably going to be Northern Flow gas or Slovakia's reverse gas.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and appropriate way if Russia “isolates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that such a method of reverse supply to Ukraine can only be used within a few weeks and will probably result in a reduction in supplies to other regions.
"There are talks between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favourable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources than from Russia or from the same source, but on other routes," the source added.
Russia outside the struggle to pollute cities with cars
Attempts to address the transport problems of major cities have been observed in most mega-cities since the second half of the twentieth century.
Typically, they were either reconfigured and extended highways, or they were intended to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and the time they were used.
The case of Singapore, where there was a strict quota for the growth of private cars and the right to purchase them at auctions, was well known.
Its price may be two or three times that of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced entry fees to the city centre.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green areas are introduced, where only cars with a certain eco-class are allowed to enter, also using high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric cars).
For example, the Beijing Environmental Protection Authority approved a five-year clean air plan in 2012 for a total value of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As the director of the transport pollution control department of the Peking Li Kooncheng Bureau for the Environment said, the main goal of the five-year-old is to reduce air pollution by 20-35 per cent by the year 2017, to increase the number of private cars to no more than 6 million (currently 5.2 million), and to increase fuel use per vehicle by no more than 5 per cent.
According to the agency, traffic in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
The main measures of the programme are restricting the use of road transport, as well as imposing additional taxes on road owners.
Among other things, the city's “green five-year-old” measures include the accelerated transition from the rest of the country to European fuel standards, the introduction of local eco-standards and the marking of cars and fuel, the restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, the ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (in addition, the creation of incentive financial schemes for replacing old cars with hybrids or electric cars), the development of electric transport (including public and service cars), and the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Peking's auto innovation also includes the ban on all private cars to drive within the fifth transport ring (in total in the PRC capital they are six) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle registration plate), as well as the issuing of lottery-based car registration cards (e.g., in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of registration permits for private cars in Beijing was only one third of the number in 2010).
According to the current government programme on environmental protection 2012-2020, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 1338).
According to the Ministry of Nature, 41% of all urban air pollution was released from “moving sources” in 2011.
In Moscow, for example, car emissions are ten times higher than industrial emissions and in St. Petersburg nine times higher.
The Russian Federation is just beginning to think about the possibility of restricting car traffic on the streets of cities.
The Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Czech Republic, Mikhail Blinkin, considers that administrative and fiscal measures to suppress the demand for road trips are known to be unpopular and can only be adopted by society on the basis of their total universalization.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters that are weakly sensitive to any regulatory effects - office and personal cars, as well as cars with a "privileged" user population of at least 200,000 (about 5 per cent of Moscow's total).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study which analyzes the balance of urban areas between residential development, road cover and the number of motor vehicles.
The main findings of researchers are that the city centre is provided with half the required roads and that most motorists in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them for long periods in parking or just on the streets.
As a result, it is suggested to build car vaults rather than to expand, rather than to reduce the carriageway (to make the streets more friendly for pedestrians) and to restrict the use and location of personal transport within the area of the security zone of the historical centre (a common area of about 3,212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
Fines for unsanctioned street trade in Vologda will increase
According to the city authorities, an increase in fines would help to clean up Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and trays.
Most street salesmen do not pay taxes; the products they make are often not subject to appropriate health controls.
This means that the health of the wetlands is at risk.
Thus, the lower penalty for illegal trade will rise sixfold since November, from 500 roubles to 3000 roubles, reports to the press service of the Vologda administration.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks to Russia's main driver of fragile economic growth, consumption.
This is above all a crisis of unpaid consumer credit and massive job cuts.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it is entirely due to consumption that is almost slowing down,” said the Chief economist Goldman Sachs for Russia, Clemens Grete, introducing yesterday's quarterly investment report on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal wage increase in Russia is about 10%.
With 6% inflation, it will be able to generate future consumer demand at about the current level, expected by Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so it is likely that they will focus on optimizing staff costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, GDP by only 2%, Mr. Grate explained.
The companies have experienced a decline in profitability.
If it did not grow up, it might result in dismissals and an increase in the rate of unemployment.
Russian business cannot raise wages, commenting by the Chief economist Barclays Capital on Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, Vladimir Pantushin.
Impunity near historical minimums, competition for employees is high.
Employers have to raise their wages in order to lure their employees out or to keep their current ones.
Consumption in Russia is still alive and the demand for credit is growing very rapidly.
According to Mr. Grafé, because of the very high rates of consumer loan, this type of credit does not have a multiplicative effect on the economy.
"The benefits to the economy from increased demand for credit have not been seen; money does not spread across the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments," said the economist.
But the problem is that Goldman Sachs is waiting for an increase in unsecured credit arrears.
They're mostly taken by poor people who have nothing to provide for.
The interest rate for such a loan is high.
As a consequence, they are not returned more frequently," said Mr. Graf.
So the second threat to Russia's economy is a possible crisis of unsecured debt.
Vasily Solodkov, Director of the Banking Institute of the U.S. State, is already seeing signs of an imminent banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to cheap resources available to State banks, had to attract high interest.
In response, government banks stepped up the war path and began to lower their interest rate, and the economist continues.
Small credit organizations cannot lend at the same interest, otherwise they will have negative interest margins.
If the State Banks do not give up dumping, Russia faces a complete banking crisis, it thinks Basil Solodkov.
Revocation of licenses by a number of banks in recent weeks has been seen by the economist as a predictor of mass collapse.
"The state's own banks will not handle this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis," warns the head of the institute.
But growing consumption will slow down without a payment crisis, believed in an investment bank, because of the failure to index government and military wages, as set out in the current version of the budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be offset by the freezing of natural monopolies (and, as a result, by a reduction in inflation).
But only partly: if investments don't grow (and the preconditions are not yet - see help), the increase in consumption will still slow down, confident in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantushin of Barclays Capital has not yet seen the preconditions for carrying out pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still a fall in the price of oil," he says.
He estimates that Russia's economy will begin to shrink at a price below $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also pointed out that the CB is not yet able to lower interest rates in the economy.
The paradox is that inflation has fallen and banks have begun to raise their stakes.
This may mean that they did not believe the CB, which announced a transition to inflation,' said Clemens to the Count.
The Centre Bank's interest policy has no effect on market rates, but only on inter-bank credit rates.
"For the CB is the collapse of all hopes," remarked Clemens the Count.
The money received at CB auctions is not used by banks to credit the economy, but to manage their liquidity.
As soon as the rate decreases, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the means are trying to be speculative against the ruble.
"The CB will sooner or later realize that this strategy is not working," said Mr. Grete and reminded him that the State plans to put a ruble on "free voyage" by the end of 2015.
But he's going to have to either do it sooner or raise the key rate of the CB (5.5%), he thinks.
He estimates that the ruble course is now artificially overstretched by 10%.
There's only one way to get weak, the expert concludes.
But if the CB drops even a shadow of doubt in the financiers that the removal of the currency corridor is not part of a policy to weaken the ruble, it can bring down the ruble much more.
The Second South Ural People's Conference was held in Chelyabinsk.
The Forum marks the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The meeting was attended by a total of about 350 participants from all the towns and districts of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious faiths, and the legislature and the executive.
The Forum's course is intended to strengthen inter-national harmony.
We can set an example here not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no differences or differences.
We live in a complete understanding," states Feofan, the Mitropolitan of Chelabin and Zlatoustov.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including the education of patriotism and cultural cooperation.
At the end of the convention, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the Forum continued in the theatre of the opera and ballet.
Here they opened an exhibition of ethnic and cultural associations in the Chelyabian region.
Snowden is willing to "co-operate" with Germany on a U.S. intelligence issue
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence exposer, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, could not answer questions about their activities.
German deputy Hans-Cristian Strebele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, who presented the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "Although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government continues to treat dissent as a betrayal and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that offer no protection."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to withdraw criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Minister of the Interior, said to Siet Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible."
The relationship between the US and Germany became strained after the claims that the NSA was listening to the telephone of chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Operman, a deputy who runs a parliamentary intelligence team, said that if there was an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness, "without endangering him or ruining his relationship with the US completely," it should be used.
Mr. Ströbele, MP of the Green Germany Party, published his photograph with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Straebele said that, according to the former contract worker's lawyer, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need guarantees that he would be there “in safety” said the MP.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had encountered a “hard and constant” campaign of harassment that had forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the global response to “his political expressions”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level officials — including in the United States — have found the discovery of an uncontrollable surveillance system useful to society.
The letter contains a proposal to work with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge for manual storage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying a handful on their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a hand-held storage and $2 for coffee or soda, although their announcement on Wednesday was that passengers would be able to keep the entire can.
The new payment for the hand baggage is extended to the upper baggage compartments, so the small bags placed under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier said she'd be charging $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if the travellers paid only when they landed.
The Spokesman for Frontier Kate O'Malley said that a $100 fee should make the passengers take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge for it," she said.
Air companies started charging for the first and second luggage bag in 2008.
The passengers trying to avoid these charges fill as much as they can into a hand-held storage room placed in the upper baggage compartments, which often lacks space in these compartments.
Fees are one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection isn't really about earning money.
The fact is, Frontier's most loyal clients claim that finding a place in the upper baggage compartments is becoming more difficult.
The passengers who buy tickets on the company's website will not be required to pay.
This means that one passenger in a queue outside the Frontier flight can get a free bag while the next passenger in a queue can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that changing the procedures on the website and on the Frontier registration slots is intended to ensure that passengers will know about the collection before they get to the landing.
The new Frontier collection for the manual storage will not start till summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Travellers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airfares love them.
They claim that baggage processing costs money, and passengers who need it must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage as a sign that air companies are charging enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of loss.
However, most of them did not deal with manual storage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual storage fee three years ago, and another Allegiant Air Discounter later followed her example.
The only other company with such a levy is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said by the J. Sorensen Airlines consultant, who closely monitors extra charges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that a manual deposit fee would cost Sprit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, former top manager of Midwest Airlines, had recently flown on the Spirit flight, and he wondered what he would find at the entrance of the landing when passengers encountered an unusual collection of Spirit by hand.
"The landing process was the smoothest I've ever seen in my career in air companies," he said.
I was expecting to see a brush of teeth and a fight at the entrance to the landing.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing went fast."
Frontier also follows the Spit for a fee of $2 for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who received soda or juice could keep the entire can and that the coffee pond would be provided free of charge.
She'll still be giving out free water.
US Airways spent a short time trying to charge for drinks in 2008, but refused to do so seven months after passengers began complaining and no other large company followed suit.
Frontier's initiative to pay for a handful when passengers don't buy tickets directly from the company is its last measure to attract customers to its website.
Air companies pay online tickets such as Orbitz from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than to contact an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went beyond everyone in this field.
In September, she began to give half the bonus miles of a frequently flying passenger to customers who had bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday she cut the majority of miles to 25 percent of miles.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip from Frontier, acquired from an online tourist agency, would make it possible to get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only choose a place in advance if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a base of loyal clients in her hometown, Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming a loss.
The revenue fell by 9 percent, and flight opportunities declined by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to a financial result published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of a sales operation.
The NBA blames the "internal error" rather than the hackers for shutting down the site
A covert national security agency announced on Friday night that the shutdown of their site for a few hours had caused a technical failure rather than a hacker, as was alleged on the network.
"NSA.gov was not available for a few hours this evening because of an internal error which occurred during the planned update," the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The statements that the crash was caused by a distributed "default" type of attack [DDoS] were incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems registered that the NSS site was not running for at least six hours and the site is still not accessible to some users.
Previously, a representative of the NSS reported to ABC News that the internal secret network of the agency had been hacked.
No classified information is in danger, the representative reported.
At least one online group of hackers stated that it was responsible for decommissioning the NBA site with a DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to fill the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is disabled.
The hacker tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to infiltrate the internal target system.
Formerly named "No such an agency," the former super-secret USB has been at the centre of public attention and criticism in recent months, following a series of discoveries of its extensive surveillance programs abroad and within the country, all of which are reactions to a secret U.S. agent's files stolen from the agency and published by a disappointed former U.S. officer, Edward Snowden.
The growing debate around the agency has led to the perception that today's incident was the result of targeted hackers.
Bombardier's income decreases with the drop in the supply and the number of plane orders
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net returns on Thursday, due to a decrease in the number of aircraft orders and delivery in the third quarter and problems with the contract in its railway unit.
Nor did Bombardier, a company based in Montreal, publish any data on the flight tests of its latest CSeries aircraft and provide new information on whether ambitious plans to commercialize the aircraft would be implemented by the next September.
After the first flight of a pilot pilot aircraft some and a half months ago, it flew only three more times, raising questions as to whether the test was on schedule.
The results did not meet the projections and led to a fall of more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst of the National Bank Financial, reduced his estimate on Thursday from "higher-market" to "medium-market" due to the belief that stock growth was limited in the next quarter or two.
“Although the decline in the quantity of aircraft was generally expected, we are certainly disappointed at the performance of the transport division,” said Doerksen in a stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will get new orders on CSeries as the flight testing program continues.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will allow it to take a place in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first pilot aircraft was presented in March and flew for the first time in September after several months of delay.
However, CSeries' firm orders have not yet been very large, as potential customers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to test the company's claims of fuel efficiency and the potential cost-effectiveness of the new liner.
There are currently 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Director, Pierre Baudouan, was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 solid orders by the time the first plane was launched for commercial use.
On Thursday, managers also assured analysts and media that the programme was moving forward.
"The model of the plane did not stay on the ground longer than expected," said Boduan during a telephone conference, adding that ground testing and software upgrades were planned for the duration of the plane's stay.
All the companies plan the tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break on the update, and that's what we did.
This will happen during the entire flight testing program.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks and the rest will soon follow, as the company reported.
However, analysts are sceptical about the claim that the first client will be able to start operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier stated that it would evaluate the start date and provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing, though likely to be in line with Bombardier's internal schedule, supports our view that commissioning will be carried over to the first quarter of 2015," said Dorksen.
In the third quarter, which ended on 30 September, Bombardier's net income dropped to $147 million, or 8 cents a share, from $172 million, or 9 cents a share, last year.
The adjusted return on the stock remained at 9 cents.
Gross income decreased slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per stock and a gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported having delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, which is less than the previous year's 57.
The total number of orders dropped from 83 to 26.
The flight space department's mailbox was $32.9 billion as of September 30th, unchanged from December 31st.
“In the area of space, the results were in keeping with our goals, but the low number of orders received and the general market conditions became an unpleasant factor,” said Boduan.
The gross revenue for the aeronautical field has fallen by 13 percent, to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, reported that the gross revenue in this sector had increased by almost 11 percent, to $2.1 billion.
The transport office's orders briefcase was $32.6 billion as at 30 September, a bit higher than on 31 December.
The revenue of the transport unit has been affected by problems in the execution of several large contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be submitted in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier, who also announced that the Chief Financial Director of Google, Patrick Peachett, would join the board of directors, had fallen by 8.5 percent, to C$4.883 on a tender in the middle of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the closest competitor to Bombardier, reported a 10 percent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony relies on lower annual returns
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony, had completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, and had reduced the profit forecast for the current financial year.
The Sony results from July to September 2013 were more depressing than expected, due to a fall in demand for television, video cameras and Japanese corporate personal computers.
Sony's television business, which in the second quarter brought the company's first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years, fell back to 93 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese market for consumer electronics is going through difficult times, especially because of a decline in demand for television.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main competitions, Panasonic, has recently shifted its focus on industrial components, where sales of the company are growing rapidly, especially through car systems and clean technologies.
As a result, by the end of the financial year, which will end in March 2014, Sony is expected to earn 1.79 billion yen of operating revenue against the expected earlier 230 billion yen.
However, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that the figure would be much higher to 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony expands the food ruler.
In the middle of this month, it was announced that the Japanese company would start selling smart watches, with a series of fancy functions, which would make it possible to get 100 times a day out of the pocket of a smartphone.
After Sony reduced the annual profit and return forecast, the company's shares lost more than 11% in the morning at the opening of the torogs in Tokyo, falling to a level of 1668 yen per stock.
The gen of speech turned out to be a stimulant for the formation of synapses
Scientists from the Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School found a protein that gave the "gen speech" Foxp2 its function by stimulating the formation of new neuron connections.
The study is published in Science and can be found on the magazine's website.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known genome whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 by the discovery of a family of several people who could not speak correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other.
Scientists found that the Foxp2 gene was compromised by family members, but the way it performed its function remained unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their Foxp2 functions act as a stimulant for the formation of new brain synapses associated with speech formation.
It does this because of another gen, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 proved to be one of the 10 genes found by authors, with only Foxp2 showing its activity.
So what SRPX2 really has to do with sounding, scientists have confirmed in an experiment on mouse.
When animals were artificially reduced, they were less likely to shout when they were separated from their mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of the sound produced was restored.
Earlier, the mouse also showed a link to the sounding of Foxp2.
Animals who were injected with a human copy of the gen were eating more frequently and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether Foxp2 and therefore its SRPX2 are associated with purely “mechanical” sound formation or more delicate processes.
A cocaine lawyer who warned the head of a criminal gang about a police investigation was imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Dietta handed information to Neil Scarborough's criminal authority.
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be solved.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prettiest lawyer, who told the drug lord about a large police investigation because he was afraid to expose his secret drug addiction, was imprisoned for three years.
42-year-old Basharat Dietta was passing to Neil Scarborough's criminal authority secret information on his drug investigation after he was threatened by his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer named Bash and called a "cool lawyer" among the criminals was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police operation following Scarborough, whom he had previously represented in a drug trial.
The officers noticed that 32-year-old Scarborough left three coke packets at a lawyer's house in Blackburn County, Lancashire while he was at a bar association dinner with his colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Dietta was "regulously using" a class A drug after testing showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on credit cards.
During the eight-month period from January to August 2011, he sought illegal information about the arrest of two persons on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were currently under police surveillance as part of a large-scale investigation into the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Merciside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police seized in a series of raids of £1.5 million and more than £200,000 in cash.
42-year-old Dietta was passing information to criminals because of the fear that his cocaine addiction would be solved.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court of Diett, who works for the Forbes Solicitors Legal Company in Blackburn, he was disgraced after having pleaded guilty in two cases of wilfully obstructing the administration of justice after a three-week trial in the Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to possessing cocaine at a previous trial.
The lawyer's discovery occurred after the police investigating Scarborough found out that he had regularly spoken to Diet on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found him coming up to Diet's house in Blackburn and putting 60 percent clean drugs in a black golf glove under the lawyer's dumpsters.
Shortly after the transfer of Scarborough, it was called repeatedly by Diett, who was at dinner at the Iwood Park Football Stadium of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine talks took place between them.
The court found out that Dietta was “regulously using” cocaine after testing found traces of a Class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Deette was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, said he had talked to the suspected drug dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a "lawyer's secret."
During his detention, Dietta took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all confiscated and a sample of his hair was taken from him.
During the police questioning, he said that he had a home office along with a job, and clients came to his house on legal matters.
However, the court learned that, after important arrests, he had called the largest drug smugglers, some of whom he had previously represented in court, to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Ann White said in the prosecution speech, "If anyone knows they shouldn't break the law, it's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Dietta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer because he has had too close a relationship with certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who provides drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly be justified, since he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the usual lawyer-client relationship.
He prevented the police investigation as much as possible to allow these persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Dietta did not honour her profession, but humiliated her.
He had become too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and he had raised doubts about his interests.
Deette did not plead guilty and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and would like to convey information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done so immediately."
But after the hearing, senior officer Lee Holstead of the Lancashire police said, "Mr. Dietta turned from a criminal lawyer to a criminal as soon as he began to buy drugs from organized crime."
His addiction to cocaine had made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to key members of criminal groups, who had asked him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
The lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and build trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Dietta betrayed that trust and tried to cover his profession.
Mr. Diett's investigation was led by the Sri Lankashire unit for particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already been sentenced to three cases of cocaine storage and now to obstruct justice by demonstrating our desire to achieve fair punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was convicted 14 years after he pleaded guilty of colluding to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
An additional 35 persons involved in the fraud were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On its website, Dietta arranged a question-and-answer conversation, in which he said that his dream job was a lawyer representing American clients with a death sentence, the perfect companion for him at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and motivation for work was inequality.
The Stadium in Yaroslavla was not ready to receive 22,000 viewers, and police officers who were present today at the meeting of the FMC were observed.
The ticket program is, in their opinion, about twice as high.
During the 1 or 16th match, the Russian Cup with the Spartak was played by only a thousand stewards, with a standard of nine thousand.
Spartakov's fans had 2,300 seats, 10 percent of the stadium's capacity, but they had sold 5,000 tickets, as agreed by the Moscow Club.
This information was published by the head of the KDC, Arthur Gregorianz.
Americans overheard Japanese high officials
On Friday, 1 November, a member of the United States intelligence services, who had chosen not to reveal his name, said that the States had overheard telephone calls from high officials in Japan.
This man confirmed that there are several listening points in the rising sun.
He said, however, that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States did not conduct any intelligence activity against each other.
This, he said, occurred during the Second World War, when those countries were allies.
And Japan, like Germany, despite its post-war alliance with Americans, is a target for intelligence, and NHK broadcasts.
None of the parties has officially commented on this information yet.
Remember, news about US intelligence surveillance on the German chancellor last week.
According to German journalists, the NBA may have been listening to Mercel's phone for the past decade.
The chancellor himself, according to some reports, took the news of her wire very painfully.
She said that the allies she believed were the US and the US for decades, such a surveillance of the head of government was not appropriate.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said that he was willing to share details about listening to Angela Merkel's phone conversations with the German prosecutor's office.
The German specifically flew to Moscow to meet an ex-CIA employee.
Bashkiria can put the grain on the market not before early 2014.
Bashkiria, in the course of government purchases, may put grain on the market not before the beginning of 2014; the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic, Nikolai Kovalenko, suggests.
To date, market prices are such that they do not encourage sales to the intervention fund.
So far, the market price is higher, and that's the demand.
"Perhaps the grain will be put on the market after New Year's Eve," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that crop yields for the current year amounted to 3.1 million ha, including 1.7 million ha of grain, an increase of 3.3% over the previous year.
For the 2014 harvest, 550,000 ha were planted (an increase of 105,000 ha compared to 2012).
The area under winter wheat and triticale has been increased, and the face has remained at the same level.
There's no Brothers' Circle in the Ministry of Internal Affairs database, which Leps in the United States has been assigned to.
The database of Russian soldiers belonging to the Brotherhood, to which Washington listed singer Gregory Leps, does not appear.
According to Interfax in Russian law enforcement agencies, after reports of the United States Department of Finance, Gregory Leps, on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal Syndicate "Broth Circle", had appeared in the media, all databases had been verified, but no such group had been found.
The distribution of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which allegedly works abroad, is considered by the security forces.
"Even in the very name is the 'brother', there's some element of mystery, there's a hint of a secret bed.
"It's all very similar to a PR action," said the agent.
On October 31, the U.S. Department of Finance announced that Arthur Badalian, Gregor Lepsveridze, Vadim Lilin, Sergei Moscalenko, Jacob Rybalski and Igor Shlykov were placed on their watch lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate.
The individuals on this list are suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontiyev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered to be powerful members of criminal groups and have been on US sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the U.S. authorities, Gregor Leps "is a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontier."
At the production center of Gregory Leps, they refused to comment on the US charges against the singer, calling them "sick."
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama classified the Brotherhood Syndicate as a “essential transnational organized criminal group” and directed the MCIF to “destroy and prevent their global criminal operations.
Putting a person on blacklists in the United States of America's Minfine carries with it a blocking of his asset in the US and a ban on business contacts with him by people living in the United States.
Scandal video hit the police
The head of Toronto, Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and outright reckless behavior, caught himself smoking crack.
The Canadian City police stated that they had a video and were ready to launch an investigation against the town leader.
He said he would not leave his post, reports CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of Rob Ford's drug use appeared on the Toronto police website.
The head of the local law enforcement agencies, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this matter.
The sheriff said he was not authorized to share the data with the public, but he was vouchsafed for their existence.
Blair said that the compromising video of Rob Ford was discovered during an anti-drug raid carried out by the guards in the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had previously written about the existence of the video, but until recently there had been no confirmation.
The mayor himself is not commenting on this.
He's just saying that he's not guilty of anything and he's not going to quit.
The police video is one of the evidence in the case of a 35-year-old friend of Ford Alexander Licey, accused of trafficking in light drugs, forgery, illegal revenue, and criminal collusion.
Sometimes Foxy was the driver of Rob Ford.
The people of the city have long demanded the dismissal of their mayor.
He fought with journalists repeatedly, appeared in public in a drunken manner, and gave himself racist and sexist speech.
OAO Rostavaeroinvest has recognized the German company Asmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of a tender based on the choice of the designer of the object.
The sum of the contract at Rostoaeroinvest is not being resolved.
According to the UAO press service, nine Russian and foreign companies took part in the competition, and the tender is expected to be prepared and sent to the State Expertise in spring 2014.
The winner will have to design a new airport passenger terminal as well as infrastructure, internal roads and airport improvements.
In the first phase of the construction, the interior of the terminal will be 50,000 square metres, and it will be possible to increase it later.
According to the Rostoaeroinvest, the design documents will take into account the prospects for the airport complex: by 2025 the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers and by 2035 it will have 6 million passengers.
By the time the tender was completed, the architectural concept of the South Aeronautical Complex was defined and developed by the British company Twelve Architectures.
The main terminal project embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov and other cities around the world.
Assmann Beraten+Planen had a major project experience, and the company had designed terminals C and E of the "Sheremetuevo International Airport" and a new airport complex at the "Knevichi" international airport in Vladivostok.
An international airport complex called South will be built in the Aksa district of Rostov and will replace the existing airport, which will be closed and eventually integrated into urban development.
The launch of the aeronautical complex is scheduled to take place in 2014 and the installation of all facilities is scheduled to take place in 2017.
A politician in Turkey declared a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began building a separation wall in the area of Nusaibin in south-east Turkey.
The local inhabitants and members of the Procuracy party of the MUP were strongly opposed to construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaibin Ayshe Gekhan, on the border with Syria, announced a hunger strike protesting against the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, and reported to RIA News in the Press Service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PMP) on Friday.
The police repeatedly dispersed protests.
The head of the Turkish MID, Muammer Gühler, first denied the construction, then declared that the wall was being built to secure the borders.
"Mary Nusaibina Aiche Gekhan, a member of the MDK, declared a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," said the party's press service.
The mayor of the city believed that the construction of the wall was intended to separate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, and the Kurds had crossed the border freely for half a century.
"This is an inhumane situation with which the Kurds will never agree," quotes Ayshe Gekhan from the party.
According to the press, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is scheduled to take place in Nusaibin on 7 November.
Venezuela will set the exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela would introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, a bolivar, in relation to a dollar for tourists.
On 1 November, Bloomberg reported this with a reference to a government decree.
Foreign travellers will be allowed to exchange in a year amounts equivalent to ten thousand United States dollars.
Venezuela would also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the Bolivians acquired in the country on their departure.
The specific rate of the bolivarian against the dollar will be set at a later date.
In February Caracas was forced to devalue local currency to a dollar of 1.3 bolivars.
However, on the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost nearly 70 percent of its value.
In September, Venezuela had almost 50 per cent inflation.
On 18 October, the Minister of Oil and the Vice President of the economy, Rafael Ramirez, announced that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to informal information brought about by the agency, Caracas may still decide to lower the rate of the national currency after the December municipal elections.
The policy of containing prices of products and goods of general consumption, as well as the high degree of adjustment of the Venezuelan economy, have led to a shortage of goods and to the functioning of the black exchange market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported that Venezuela had a shortage of toilet paper.
Andrey Belmach, the director of the Southerra, said that it was difficult to tell how long it would take to find a new chief coach.
This post became vacant after Sergey Shepelev's retirement.
Resignation took place only a few hours ago, so to tell you how long it'll take to find a new coach, I'm not ready,--itar-TASS quotes Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're exploring all possible options.
Priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
I don't just want to find some coach, but someone who's been at our club for years and gets some results.
The Kenyan press is indignant about the media law
"This is a terrible place, and there is reason to ask, "What can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judicial system in the future?" said the newspaper, calling the law unconstitutional.
"This law is very severe and reprehensible, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, director of the Capital Group, a parent company called CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and a news site.
He said that the new media court “will always be biased because it is a continuation of government” and limiting content and advertising will damage Kenya's global economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and return it to the members," he said.
According to The Star, the new law would actually allow the government to “make the media a dead grip,” while The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya were “a serious blow,” and criticized the bill as a “draconian” bill.
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to improve national security following the September attack by Muslims at the Westgate shopping centre.
Kenyan media has provoked the government's anger by broadcasting surveillance videos, where troops who have been sent to the scene of the attack are allegedly robbing a expensive shopping centre.
David Kimayo's police chief reacted by calling two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was cancelled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers may be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists may be fined up to one million, with an additional risk of being “excluded from the lists,” i.e. to be prohibited from receiving official journalism.
The court also has the right to seize the property of the perpetrator if the fine is not paid.
According to Daily National, "even one fine is enough to paralyse most FM radio stations."
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called live blogosphere.
Politicians realize that by making the media shut up, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote a journalist named Nation Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenyan media as a key source of disincentives and balancing forces in public life.
"The politicians themselves will ruin the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering," he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of social anger in the past.
In May they voted to lift the cuts made by the National Wages Commission and to restore their huge salary, which is about 532,000 shillings per month, without tax, one of the highest in the world.
A new expense line will appear in the payment of the citizens' utility payments, which is to pay for the major maintenance of the house.
The most estimated cost of a standard two-room apartment is 100 to 400 roubles per month from the new year.
The exact norm will be set by the government of the region.
But when you paint the entrance, fix the staircases, or even replace the elevator, it's up to the lodgers themselves.
This law was approved by members of the Regional Duma.
Vladimir Kharnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "In this case, too, it is necessary to order the order of the chaperon of the houses, to collect funds not from the management companies, which are often registered with us in Moscow, in Orenburg, or somewhere else, it will be the State's control over the expenditure of the funds collected by the inhabitants for the repair of the apartment houses."
State-controlled construction now.
A law that protects against fraud has been approved by means of a final reading.
The document was not born empty.
In our region, 45 thousand people have been affected by unjust developers.
The majority's problems have been solved.
By the way, the new law lays down rights and duties for all participants in the construction.
Vladimir Kharnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said, "It is no secret that abuses have begun in this area, as well, because the same money fell in the '98s, and in the 2000s the same money."
People started earning money to cover the loophole, including by passing these two laws.
Under Voronej, it was decided to build a temporary stay centre for foreign citizens subject to deportation.
The District Parliament had adopted such a law not only under the pressure of the Federation.
The problem of illegal immigrants in the region is even greater.
In the past year, for example, migration registration has attracted just over 100,000 aliens.
But only one in five issued a formal work permit.
Where the rest of us work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Kharnikov, president of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said, "They have broken the law, but are not criminals."
There's no court, and you have to deport them. They have to be kept somewhere.
The Federation had decided to provide such places with regional funds.
In the Voronezh region, this is the Old Olshanka district of Semiluk.
Well, lastly, the Regional Parliament gave new benefits to parents with many children.
First, families with 5 or more children are completely free from transport taxes.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million -- but so do parents with many children.
Second, and that's what's most important, for those who adopt three or more babies, they'll be granting shelter subsidies from the next year.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at a price of 30,000 per metre.
A family, for example, of 6 people -- the father, the mother, the birth child and the third -- adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the State purchases a flat of 103 square metres for 3,300,000 roubles.
For the left shore or southwest neighbourhood, it is a good option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage in the middle of nowhere for that.
Baumgertner has been nominated to the Board of Directors of Uralcaly
The current UAO Board of Directors, Uralcalius, has submitted the candidacy of the arrested Director of Minsk, Vladislav Baumertner, for a new board member, on the Russian company's website.
Bumughertner is on the list of 11 persons nominated to the new Board of Directors.
The list was prepared for the extraordinary shareholders' meeting on 29 November, at which a new board of directors will be decided by vote.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
When he was arrested in August this year, he was charged with abuse of official powers.
However, later, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, at a press conference, said that Baumgertner's charges were classified as "theft."
Matt Dalton's Oil Management Gateman refused to comment on Vladimir Creekunov's departure as a lower-level teacher.
Golkiper believes that Dmitri Balmin, the acting chief coach, enjoys a great deal of authority from the players and will carry out his duties.
Let's remind you, today, the oil guy fired Creek.
To be honest, I don't want to comment on Vladimir Cricunov's dismissal, quote Dalton RlA's "News."
I can only say that Dmitri Balmin will live up to his responsibilities -- I have no doubt about that.
He's got a lot of authority in the team, and this young specialist is certainly looking forward to a great future.
Leonardo Bonucci's defender of the Juventus won't help the team in the next Italian match with the Parma.
According to Football Italy, the coach's office decided not to include it in the game's application to meet the fourth round of the League of Champions with the Real.
Nor will they take part in a match with the "Parma" of Lechsteiner, Vuccinic and Pepe.
And forward Fabio Quillerella recovered from the accident and was ready to play.
A tax manoeuvre that provides for an increase in the mineral taxes on oil at the same time as a reduction in export duties and an increase in accents will lead to fuel travel.
According to experts, these measures could add an additional 619.3 billion roubles to the budget.
The President of the Court of Krasnoyar was kidnapped by a blow to his head.
Unknown men attacked the President of the Krasnoyar District Court, Vladimir Brookonko, by stealing his license.
According to Interfax, late in the evening on Wednesday, an intruder hit the judge in the head, causing him to faint.
When the 63-year-old president came to his senses, he found out that he had been removed from his office.
Money and other values were not taken by criminals.
He got home on his own, and the next day he called the police.
A crime investigation is under way and a search for criminals is under way.
"Zenita" patients on the club's official website recognized the Russian ex-captain as the best player in the past month.

Ivanov opened the 7th Inter-Regional exhibit "Medicine and Health"
The "Medicine and Health - 2013" exhibition was opened on the basis of the "Olympia" sports and entertainment complex.
The First Vice-President of the Ivanov Oblast, Olga Hasbulatov, took part in the opening event.
The exhibition shows the work of the Ivanov Region Regional Public Health Institutes as well as commercial health institutions in the regions of Central Russia.
The exhibition will include seminars, round tables, presentations.
During the exhibition, a mobile complex (full diagnosis), a mobile fluorographer and a blood-transfusion station were organized.
All interested will be able to obtain free diagnostics, specialist advice, take part in a master class in physical medicine, and familiarize themselves with the range of services provided by health institutions in Ivanov Oblast.
In addition, the exhibit is marked as a "Donor's Day".
The general concept of the exhibit "Medicine and Health - 2013" is a preventative direction in medicine and the promotion of healthy lives.
The exhibition includes medical goods and services, equipment, medicine and medicine that improve the quality of life.
The main directions of the exhibition were: the development of cooperation with the medical industry and providers of the Ivanov region and the regions of Russia; the demonstration of medical goods and services, equipment, and medicine that improve the quality of life; and the establishment of business contacts between the health institutions of the Ivanov region.
US secretary: Special services have sometimes gone too far in data collection.
US State Secretary John Kerry admitted that the US intelligence services sometimes "came too far" when collecting data and listening, but the politician said that 70 million people in the media were being wired.
I assure you that innocent people have not been harmed in this process, but the attempt to collect information has been made.
Yes, in some cases this went too far and wrongly.
I admit it, as the President also admits... and we'll make sure that it doesn't happen in the future," quotes the AFP secretary.
Italian employees with seniority give way to young people
Italian unemployment scores.
Data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5 per cent of the population is now unemployed.
So bad has not been the case since the Second World War.
Among young people, the rate is several times higher.
40.4 per cent of the population aged 15 to 24 is unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is early retirement of older workers.
This experiment is already being carried out by the country's largest power company, and the laws that have been adopted allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for long-term employees.
However, Italy, on the other hand, is awaiting a common problem for Europe with an aging population.
And economists aren't sure that a pre-rotation scheme will justify itself.
The result of the construction of TIPs in Moscow
Every year, the capital authorities promise to build more transport/transit hubs (TPNs).
It is planned to launch 255 TPNs by 2020.
The result of the project was examined by our correspondent.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence broke out on the Smolenski railway line.
The inscription said that the transport hub was being set up.
This was all very strange, as there is no ground transport stopping near Smolenski and therefore cannot be moved on.
To get to the nearest stop on the garden ring, we have to make it to about 130 meters, including a ground crossing through the Carmanica alley.
Smolenski's almost finished now.
The flower shop disappeared, the newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt was replaced by a bar bar before the entrance.
That's the whole transport knot.
Transport hubs are flat and capital, explained in the press service of the Capital Transport Department.
There are no capital TPs yet.
And flats are about building parking lots, removing commercial objects that interfere with passenger movement, creating small architectural forms, and upgrading.
In fact, the flat-painted TPNs are not even dedicated to transporters, but to professional providers from the capital repair department in Moscow.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex design,” explains the director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics, Michael Blinkin.
Sometimes a roof over your head and a placard are enough to announce the arrival time.
For example, the Yasenevo subway recently opened a fully-fledged flat-bed-bedded hub.
No curtains, but with interceptive parking and a placard indicating when the bus comes.
But in pursuit of numbers, officials record anything in a TPK.
As early as 2011, the City Hall had planned to build on all 151 knots, 59 of which were capital.
Now there are as many as 255 TPOs in the plans for 2020.
Of these, 1.5 are promised to be handed over this year.
Although there is a TIP program in the city, no quality criteria have been set, Alexander Morozov, co-chair of City and Transport.
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of each transfer is often impaired.
According to the expert, there should be two criteria: first, reducing the time of the transfer, secondly, convenience.
First of all, it's possible to change the way of transport without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, however, TIPs sometimes turn exactly the other way around.
A bright example of the U.S. subway.
In the past, suburban buses from the Yaroslav highway came into the square in front of the main entrance to the OCE.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Jaroslavka to the Cosmonaut Street.
Farther from the subway, farther from the monorail, but closer to the apartments.
The people didn't want a bus station under the windows at all, and they complained to all possible bodies.
With the capital TPU in Moscow, it didn't happen at all.
The first one started building five years ago on the Planetary subway.
The project was intended to be exemplary.
And indeed, there's a pattern of how a renegade node that pays off an investor turns into a banal mall.
No, there's bus fares, curtains to keep the subway from going in the rain, and three floors of parking.
True, the Chemkin troll buses No. 202 and No. 203 in Moscow TIP did not have a seat in principle.
They've been pushed away as strangers from the subway.
But there's more room left for trade.
It's only 32 stores, and there's almost all of them, from the zoos to the car.
Well, really, what if one of the bus passengers needs to buy a new car on the road?
We always have a shopping center when we build a capital TP.
Recently, the situation reached a logical conclusion when a part of the parking lot decided to be placed on the market.
Now, on the third floor of the "Planerny" TP, there's a violent trade in the floor-marked parking spaces.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech, and guards who look angry at our photographer.
The transfer knot has finally turned into a market.
The thing is, the Planetary subway used to have a market, but it was destroyed.
And in the prefecture, the merchants were spared and let into the interceptive parking lot of the transfer hub.
Anyway, because of high prices, it's always empty.
The funny thing is that the market has collapsed in order to build in its place... a new flat TP.
That's the rocking.
On the subway Clulow, the distance from the subway to the bus's lobby was 50 meters, says Alexander Morozov.
Since the construction of the mall, the distance has allegedly increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the entire mall.
After 22 hours when it's closed, you have to walk around it in the open.
However, the designs on the "Planer's" and "Club's" will soon appear to be blooms.
In mid-September, the city and land commission of the city hall approved the planning decisions for the first eight capital TPNs.
Four of them will be 25-story, except for two or three subterranean areas.
The main monster will grow up in the Tusino subway, it'll have 418.7 thousand square meters of square.
The directors of the railway stations of the RZD who are responsible for the construction of TSPs on the subway have already told journalists that future multi-storeys will include shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials say that multi-layer parking is a third to half of the area.
Take, for example, public garages.
Let's say that the 258-bed garage recently built on International Street has an area of 80-15 square meters.
So it's going to take about 80,000 squares to park for 2.6 thousand cars at the Petrosco-Redowski.
It's less than a third of the stuff that they're going to build there.
Let one or two floors go on all sorts of bus fronts.
There are at least 150,000 square metres of commercial property left.
And this, for a moment, is almost two GUMs.
If railway stations and train stations build capital TIPs, the rest of the sites will be absorbed by metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many "functional facilities," including hotels, offices, and even sports.
By the way, in the Moscow Department of Property, journalists were recently told that a draft decree was being prepared that would allow investors to apply directly for a TIP site to officials.
No competitions.
Because it's like transport matters are a priority for the city.
The perfect TPK is, for example, the Harvard Station in Boston or the Stadium Station in Toronto, sure Alexander Morozov.
There, troll buses and trams descend to subway levels and the distance between the metro train and the tram is only 50 meters away from the street.
There's no extra trade around.
But Moscow officials are thrown out at extremes.
Either we don't build anything, or we'll break down 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser suggests that the insult of patriotic feelings be treated as extremist.
To legislate against the patriotic feelings of citizens against the provocations and insults of the Fair Russia, it suggests that the insult of patriotic feelings be treated as extremist activity and punished for it by five years in prison.
According to the newspaper Izvestia, such legal changes, prepared by Oleg Miheev, Vice-Douma Energy Committee, have already been submitted to the Supreme Court and the Government for an opinion.
Under the patriotic sentiments of citizens, the author of the revisions suggests to understand the emotional connection of a person to the country of which he is a national, marked by love for the country, responsibility for its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikhayev points out, domestic law penalizes abuse of the formal characteristics of State power, the flag and the flag.
However, according to the Parliament, the protection of Russians whose feelings may be disturbed by and insulting State symbols and other contempt for our country is not sufficiently developed in Russian law.
By way of example, he cited the debate that was unfolding every year on the eve of Victory Day, when some mediamen allowed themselves to question the heroic performance of the people of the USSR in the struggle against Nazis.
On the eve of the main public holiday, the 9th of May Day, a real vacanalysis is unfolding every year.
By practising the wits and the "alternative" view of history, some publicists have come to the conclusion that, unfortunately, the cultural Germans have not won the wild Soviet Union!
I think this is absolutely intolerable in a country where pride in history remains the nation's main "spiritary crutch," Oleg Miheev resents.
Moreover, according to Miheev, there are far more patriotic people in Russia than there are religious people, but the law punishes insulting the feelings of the faithful, while insulting patriotic feelings can almost be done with impunity.
In the opinion of the national elector, it is necessary to treat insults of patriotic feelings as extremist activities and to provide for a corresponding penalty in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings, from a fine of 100 to 5 years' imprisonment.
On Thursday, October 31, the Earthquake with a magnetoid of 6.6 occurred in the Cokimbo district of central Chile, and is being handed over by Reuters.
The earthquake was about 10.7 kilometers deep in the ocean and 54 kilometers southwest of the city, as explained on the U.S. Geology Service (USGS) website.
The streams were recorded at 8:03 p.m. local time (3:03 p.m. on November 1, Moscow).
No casualties or destruction caused by an underground explosion have been reported yet.
Remember, Chile is in one of the most seismic areas of the world, so earthquakes are not rare.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
At that time, an earthquake of 8.8 magnetoids and the resulting tsunami had caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile had the most powerful earthquake in recent history, with an earthquake of 9.5 in 1960.
More than 5,000 people died as a result of that natural disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: The Greenspace case will be considered fairly
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, announced on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be considered in strict accordance with Russian law.
France may be sure that the case will be handled in accordance with the law, and we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee respect for the law," said Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with the Prime Minister of France, Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the arrested Greenspace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisan, like the rest of the activists, has been charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," quotes Mr. Ero's RlA News.
"Our country cannot support activities that may harm the environment, no one is allowed to violate the law," said Dmitry Medvedev.
He said that any structure that tried to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including the extraction of energy, was dangerous.
He stressed that these facilities were "like a powder barrel," and he mentioned what had happened in the Gulf of Mexico, and he was broadcasting "RlA News."
The UN announces new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of challenges to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which had been set out 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australia's diplomatic community played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations sustainable development summit, which began in Rio the night before.
They were included in the final document to be signed by world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the evening before the summit that it was time to “take precedence over national interests”.
“I am glad that UN member countries have agreed to launch and monitor the process of creating universal sustainable development goals, the SDGs,” he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post2015 development framework.
I will make every effort to use the authority vested in me by member countries to translate our vision of sustainable development goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow due to the conflict of powerful people
Under the top-down statue of Zamora Machel, the founder President of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the middle of Maputo to chant peace messages at one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Executive Director of an investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business costume to a shirt that had been decorated with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Capital Square of Independence.
Over two weeks there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, one of the most violent clashes since the truce more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement supported first by the White authorities of Rodesia and then by the South African Government in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the truce in 1992 it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to relapse into a full-scale conflict, but recent events have upset foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for a rapidly growing economy, as the discovery of huge shelf gas and coal fields in the north-west can attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
Frellimo's ruling party, the leading political force since 1975, and Renamo's party have accused each other of the resulting tension.
The Renamo Party claims that the government was the source of the latest clashes by attacking its members in Sofala Province, the traditional fence of Renamo, on 17 October.
Attacks on former rebels then increased when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, reported to the Financial Times by Fernando Mazanga, a representative of Renamo.
The government will blame Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armand Guebuza has tried to dispel fears of insecurity.
Guebuza said to AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt like a "failer" who wanted to use "all that remained of his power to try to prove that he could force the government to make his own decisions."
Both Frellimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears increased following reports that Mazanga had declared Renamo's rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He informed the Financial Times that he was referring to the non-observance of the agreement by the Frellimo party.
“Our goal is to return to the talks, but seriously,” said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease the tension which has been compounded by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two powerful people, Gebuza and Dhlakama, who have run into their foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University and expert in Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiationist and none of them is willing to make the necessary compromises.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve election reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain the government's concessions and financial bonuses.
Renamo's vote has declined since 1992 while the new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), founded by former Renamo member, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza, who was due to resign next year, when his second term ended, wished to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace, because he doesn't want to quit the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is not clear what opportunities Renamo has, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on a key motorway from north to south.
Most of the fighting took place in Sofala Province, which is a few hundred miles north of Maputo, but includes Beira, a port that miners, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June Rio suspended the use of railways for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when asked whether Renamo would repeat the threat.
The Renamo Party wanted to “ warn the international community that Mozambique is not doing well,” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased government discontent, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of an independent media company, Mediacoop.
“People think that responsibility for the country's future lies with the Government and the President, who must find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultan, a protester, said that people just wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelio; they just want peace, they want free access to roads," he said.
The "Art Mainstry" premiere series will take place in Moscow.
A series of "Art Mainstreet" movies, where audiences will be able to see one Russian and four foreign movies a few days before they are released, will be held at the Rollan Cinema from 1 to 5 November, reports the RIA "News" with a reference to the project's organisers.
Opens the Art Mainstry program by the French director's comedy and actress Reim Kerichi's "Paris at any cost."
This is the story of the Maya model in the French capital (Kerichi itself), which is being deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to the film, Kerichi will also be shown a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duck's "Mebius", the melodramatic biotype of Oliver Hirschbigel's "Diana: A History of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts as the main actor and main film of the May Cannes Film Festival "The Life of Adele" by Abdelatif Keshish.
The only Russian member of "Art Mainstry" will be the winner of Alexander Veldinski's film "Geographer of the globe" on the basis of the same name novel by Alexei Ivanov.
Constantine Habenski played the main role in the film, the charming loser teacher of Victor the Servant, whose work was also marked by the prize of the "Cinotaurus".
Children need to learn myths and legends as "models of the way of life," says the author.
The Torah story could show that "absolute power cannot defeat sophisticated tricks," while King Arthur's stories show how important it is to have a dream.
By saying that many myths will be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to teach in schools,” Crossley-Holland advocates the “sustainable selection” of age-appropriate texts.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I was in favour of introducing them into the curriculum for twenty years.
He added that the “excessive moralization” of authors and teachers “would interest” children, while the basic ideas were “combined” in exciting stories.
Crossley Holland, who translated "Beowulf" from Anglo-Saxon, and wrote "The Norwegian Myths Collection" for Penguin and "The British People's Tales," said, "You may have intentions, but you better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps a great difference between an adult writer who writes for adults and an adult writer who writes for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there must be an innate understanding of right and wrong.
And this should be sublimated; revealed through history rather than clearly defined.
Old principle: show, not tell.
A football fan was arrested in Voronezhsk oblast breaking the window in the train station waiting room.
At 9 a.m. on 29 October, the transport police took off the passenger train of two football fans belonging to the Moscow region.
Upon going to the game of the favorite team, the guys on the way made a drunken debacle on the train.
Young people were placed on duty at the police station at the Gryazi Station to draw up a report on administrative offences.
There the fans repented of their anti-public behavior.
The police processed administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train, and at the station station they began waiting for him to arrive.
At half the first night the fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly came back and broke the front door window in the train station hall with his foot.
A transport police officer and a security guard from the RZhP broke up the glass.
They managed to apprehend an intruder trying to escape the scene.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation is conducting a check.
There is a question of initiating criminal proceedings, and Sergey Olkhovik, a senior referencer for the direction of information and public relations to the South-East LU of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs on transport.
Vitalia Mutko: Watermen?
I think we're 15 years back.
The sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, gave his opinion on the riots at the stands during the "Shinnik"-Spartak Cup of Russia.
I'm a supporter of the organization of sports events: clubs, leagues, the Russian Federation.
But we can see that they've taken a different position.
They expect someone from outside to clean up.
It's a very good position, but it's not quite the right one.
You have to organize the fans, the clubs should invite their flight attendants instead of letting the case go on their own.
We have now developed a special government decree on the rules of conduct in the stadiums.
Once it's adopted, we'll get to the bottom of it.
But I'm sure I'll invite all the players in the football process.
I read Leonid Feudun's interview.
State, let's move the law faster.
It's like they're the Bavaria fans in Jaroslavl and they're all set up.
And we're outsiders.
Actually, it's awful to see the stand beaks swept out of the fireplace.
And that's in a country that's preparing for a world championship.
"I feel like we're 10-15 years back," said Mutko.
Snowden can be interrogated in Russia
Edward Snowden, an ex-employee of the United States intelligence services, is likely not to go outside Russia to testify in the hearing of German chancellor Angela Merkel's telephone conversations.
As Interfax said on Friday, a source familiar with the situation can answer questions from the German prosecutor's office in writing or in person in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure from Russia is almost impossible.
"In this case he will lose his status as a refugee and may be handed over to Washington by US allies," said the agency.
“In addition, in principle, the Office of the Federal Public Prosecutor could send representatives to the Russian Federation or send written questions to Snowden,” the source added, adding that the matter should be addressed at the inter-State level.
Earlier, German Bundesteg Hans-Cristian Strebele had reported that Edward Snowden was willing to testify in the case of the US Special Service for the German chancellor's hearing.
Snowden is willing to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or on German soil.
An ex-CIA employee has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the U.S. National Security has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, to do so, it is necessary to define clearly all the conditions for his arrival,' said Shrebel to the Europeans TV channel.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoli Kucheren, commenting on the statement made by the source of Interfax, stated that his client could work with the German investigators, but would decide when and how.
A U.S. citizen, Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the ClA, ran to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he published information on U.S. secret intelligence operations on Internet surveillance.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport had been revoked by the United States authorities, who had in absentia accused him of serious charges, and remained in the transit zone of the Sheremetevo airport until early August.
On 1 August, Snowden received an application for temporary asylum in Russian territory for a year and left the Cheremetevo on the same day.
Yesterday, American lawyer Anatoli Kucheren announced that his client had joined a "large Russian company."
Last week, German media reported spying on Angela Merkel.
According to journalists, the telephone conversations of the chancellor by the Americans began in 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after publishing this information, declared that the surveillance of Merkel was in breach of German laws and sovereignty.
Ponomarev left Fair Russia.
A member of the State Duma from the Fair Russia Party, a member of its branch in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarev, submitted an application to withdraw from a political organization.
He applied to the party's New-Siberian Regional Office, according to the Parliament.
According to its statute, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the justices.
We're sitting down, drinking tea...
"Somehow a lot of people want to see the picture of "Ilya Ponomarev puts a party ticket on the table," but there's nothing so epic about it," the MP remarked.
Ponomarev stated that he maintained a good relationship with the Regional Ester Office.
Meanwhile, it is not the intention of the State Duma of Ilya Ponomarev to give up his term.
He explained that, despite his withdrawal from the party, he remained a member of the faction and was legally unable to withdraw.
Reports of Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave the Fair Russia party appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitri Gudkov and Valery Zubov would join him in the RS, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the conclusion of a peace agreement
The head of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Fumio Kisida, met with the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace agreement between the two countries.
“I wish to exchange frank views on the further development of the political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace agreement”, stated Kisid at a meeting.
The Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs recalled that, after Prime Minister Sindzo Abe of Japan visited Russia, relations between countries had become warmer and had become two-way.
The Russian Minister, for his part, said that the Russian Federation would meet Japan in dealing with difficult political issues, writing the RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace agreement between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
Therefore, there are protests in Tokyo today demanding the return of the land lost after the Second World War.
There are cars driving through the Japanese capital, from which the loudspeaker says, "Return the Northern Territory!"
The police don't stop the protesters, they make sure that the noise is not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: The tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
You can safely say that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedy in America: almost a century ago, the artist Frank Faye, who worked as a conference artist at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
The Faye's innovation was eventually picked up by other, very recently by the New York comedy festival.
Created and sponsored by Caroline Hearse, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with over 60 shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headlines started at the Carolines, and then they made more success, and they reached a level where they were already too famous to perform at the club," said Hersch.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes talks by Wanda Sykes, Cathy Guy and Bill Mara, and "Stendup for heroes" -- an annual music comedian charity concert for military war-veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will appear among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy expanded.
Several comedians participating in the festival this year gained popularity in non-traditional ways, such as a show on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was famous for his role in a comedy show on a low-known cable television channel (known as "Liga" by FXX on the subject of fantasy football), and now hosts his own skate show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined the acting team both in "Saturday Night Live" and in "Parks and Recreation Areas," although she is most famous for the series of viral rollers, "Marsel - a shell in boots".
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with their own style (surrealistic pessimistic Anthony Jashelnik, a wicked, race-oriented Camau Bell), are the results of a devolved world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be an interview between David Steinberg and Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but then became a successful film and television director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the host of a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place in the Down Hall in central Manhattan.
"This town is certainly the central element of all of Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes walked around some street between the two houses and thought, "Well, if I don't have any money, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistani authorities started talks with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun talks with the Taliban.
This was reported by that country ' s British Embassy, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz HARIF, is visiting.
The Head of Government of Pakistan made a statement on talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with the British Vice-Primeman Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister has reported that the dialogue with the Taliban has begun," states the statement of the Pakistani Embassy in London.
-He said he hoped and prays that the dialogue should work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan,” added the diplomatic community.
The Pakistani Taliban (Techrik-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the same-named Afghan movement, but operate independently of it in the north-west of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
The Government of Islamabad had previously attempted to start talks with the local Taliban, but the movement had refused to engage in dialogue.
It stated that it would only go to the talks if the authorities took the troops stationed in areas where the Taliban were operating and released from prison the arrested Islamists.
Nawaz Sharif came to London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, held a three-way meeting in London to discuss the prospects for a peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil dropped to $96 a barrel.
The oil price continued to fall on Friday, when anxiety over large stocks eclipsed a message showing that China's energy-efficient manufacturing sector was gaining momentum.
The United States' standard oil supply in December had been 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 a barrel later in the morning in European time in electronic tendering on the New York commodity exchange.
On Thursday, the contract increased by 39 cents, resulting in a 5.8 per cent drop in October.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy announced on Wednesday that US reserves had increased by 4.4 million barrels in the last week.
Over 25 million barrels have been added in five weeks.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, based on two reports of the Chinese industry showing an upsurge in its activity.
This suggests that China's recovery may continue to take effect after the third quarter's growth rate has risen to 7.8 per cent after a 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Brint's oil, also used by US oil processing companies, has increased by 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel at the London Intercontinental Exchange.
Patrick Roux, the Chief Trainer of Colorado, explained his decision to release Semen Varlamov's Hollywood player at the first minute in a Friday match with Dallas, expressed his confidence that the recent night behind the cell had not shaken his confidence in the Russian, passing from Dallas a subpoena to "SE" by Natalia Schmelev.
And what do we have to wait for, said Rua after the morning roll of Lavin.
Of course, what happened to us all is a matter of concern, but we are sure of it and feel that it will be useful for him to get on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show him his usual level.
So you're quite sure the situation didn't affect the gatekeeper's condition?
We'll see today.
No doubt our players will support Warley by helping him guard the gates, as was the case in the previous match of this season.
Most importantly, no one on the team is going to make any conclusions until the trial is resolved.
In Siberia, you shouldn't be vegan: warm tomato will not replace soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, researched by RlA News.
People who have completely abandoned animal products must not live in Siberia.
They can't survive winter here without health loss, and no warm tomatoes compensate for it, and the vegan-day study of New-Siberian dietologists and doctors consider it.
Drink butter with liters
Strict vegetarianism, when discarded not only by meat and fish, but also by milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, dietologists believe that in Novosibirsk and other towns in Siberia it is at least not useful for health to follow such strict food standards.
The total loss of animal products is not good.
Animal proteins contain indispensable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate by plantation.
You have to have at least milk or eggs in your diet," the dietist Marina of God is sure.
It gives an example of a fish containing an indispensable omega-3 fatty acid.
The most rich vegetable oil he's got is linen.
"To demand it in the quantity necessary for man, you have to drink a litre!" said a dietologist.
The doctors believe that Siberians need to pay special attention to their diet in winter.
This season, vegetarianism is particularly questioned.
In our reality, food demands are high.
You need an elevated calorie rate to keep you warm.
"If a person restricts himself to animal products, therefore, he loses that calorie," says the specialist.
That's accepted by the diet doctor, Olga Poznik.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruit are not the way out.
It is better for a person to eat mainly products that are grown in the region or where he was born.
The genetic code is geared to the best understanding and digestion of these products.
And in winter people don't want to eat a cucumber, they want a hot soup or something better," the doctor explained his position.
She said that from what vegans can eat, different grains, grains, beans, local vegetables, winter apples, frozen berries are really useful.
But that's certainly not enough to feed you properly.
According to the gastroenterologist Claudius Arifoulina, Siberians only have enough vitamins in their bodies from mid-August to mid-September.
The complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural environment, where temperature can change by 30 degrees in a day and the snow lies in May, is incomprehensible.
Organism needs energy to live, and that's, above all, fat," says the doctor.
Doctors note that vegetative activity is particularly dangerous for children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And by sticking to vegetarianism, we give them incomplete.
Pregnant women also need increased protein, vitamins and micronutrients on the menu.
"The vegans don't get them," I'm sure.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose anything, "play the toys he wants."
He's got an already formed body, skeleton, organs.
Still, children must eat well.
If parents take him away from some micronutrient or amino acid, choosing for him what he's going to eat, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of some kind of substance for brain development, vision, bones will no longer be restored tomorrow," she says.
All surveyed health professionals agree on the low quality of winter-growing vegetables and fruit.
What is brought to us and grown in the warmth contains less of the micronutrients we need than (growing) in the open soil.
"Quality of food is not the same," says God.
Arifoulin also notes that imported and warm vegetables and fruit are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the willingness of the growers to harvest a larger crop is a loss of quality.
"The apples don't get brown on the cut, the cucumbers are rapidly yellowing and molding, the tomatoes are tasteless and neuromatic," quotes the paramedic, adding that they are probably filled with an excessive amount of fertiliser.
And they don't sell vitamins, they become cellular.
This is not accepted by the Siberian Institute of Physics and Technology for Agrary Problems, Ph.D. Vera Petruk.
She said that, with the right approach and respect for all the standards and requirements in the stoves, it was possible to grow full vegetables.
If they try to get more from a square metre, they will certainly get more water and feed the plants with mineral fertilisers.
For example, when too many nitric fertilisers grow rapidly, they are large but watery and watery,” she added, adding that the quality issue depended first and foremost on the manufacturer's conscience.
The court suspended the execution of the stay-and-search practice in the New York police department
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal of the Federal District suspended the execution of a court order requiring a change in the stop-and-search programme of the New York police department and dismissed the judge from the case.
The Court of Appeal of the Second District of the United States stated that the execution of the decisions of Judge Shira Sheindlin would be suspended pending receipt of the results of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, the judge ruled that the town had broken the Constitution in the way he carried out a programme of street detention and questioning.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and the order for correction, including a warrant to appoint a supervisor to help the police department change the work practice and related curriculum.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a hearing on the parties' motion to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal argued that the judge should be dismissed because she had broken the U.S. Code of Conduct and had not considered it necessary to avoid being biased, partly because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to court criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by resorting unjustly to blacks and Latin Americans on the stop-and-search programme.
It had appointed an external monitor to monitor major changes, which included policy, training and monitoring reforms, and had decided to launch a pilot programme to test television cameras in police stations where most detentions took place.
In August, New York decided to discontinue the storage of names and addresses of people whose cases had been dismissed after police testing.
The City Appeal is due to take place after 14 March 2014.
Many civil rights lawyers have criticized the tactics of stopping and searching.
Stopping-search has been a practice for several decades, but the number of documented stops has increased sharply under the administration of independent mayor Michael Blumberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 in 2011, most of whom are black and Latin American.
In 2004, four people, all members of national minorities, filed a collective suit.
Supporters of the stop-and-search program in the New York Department of the police say that these changes will put an end to unfair practices, form a more robust and effective police service and may affect the way other police departments implement this practice.
Opponents argue that changes will reduce police fighting rather than crime, lead to unnecessary waste of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult police conditions due to a reduction in the number of officers by a few thousand over the past decade.
The judge observed that she was not stopping the practice of stopping-and-searching, which was in keeping with the Constitution, but was changing the way the New York police stopped people.
In the area of the Tretikov Gallery, a pedestrian zone was opened
A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretikovski Gallery and occupies a section two miles from the Novokzny railway station to the Bolt Square.
All along, street torches, flower-wrappers, berries, urns and toilets have been installed, deaf fences have been removed and illegal advertisements have been made.
In addition to the Clementsky and Lavrushin alleys, which were already pedestrians, five streets were closed for cars: the Ordinal Stalled, the Great and Small Tolmatchev alley, the Kadashev Coast and the Bolt Square.
Transport through the streets of Morocco and Petrovka is not restricted.
On Friday Street, from the Novokozny Station Lobby to the Clementski alley, the conditions for pedestrians have been created without removing the traffic and cutting the carriageway, and they pass newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretikov Gallery, the Temple of the Holy Martyr of Clement by the Pope of Rome, the Museum, libraries, monuments and other sights.
Previously, the Tver Road, the alley alleys and the Bridge Street were completely pedestrians.
The large Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, decided to shut down for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used the phone hack to check a confidential message.
Former editor of the News of the World, Andy Coleson, allegedly used "the breakup of the phone, the surveillance and the opposition" in an attempt to prove false information about the novel of Charles Clark, who was then the Home Secretary.
The prosecutor, King Andrew Edies, informed the Court of Old Bailey that in May 2005 the News of the World had received untrustworthy news that Clark was meeting with her "attractive special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The newspaper ordered private detective Glenn Mühleyre to hack Polby's voice mail and followed her outside to interview her, but he also called her and left her voice messages, and the court heard.
"The prosecution believes that Mr. Coleson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person to stand by someone's house hoping to surprise someone, he is the person who likes to offer history to people to see what they're going to say," said Mr. Edies.
He said that the News of the World had used three ways to investigate stories: telephone hacking, surveillance, and opposition.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the follow-up, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hack?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
The news of Clark's novel first attracted the attention of the News of the World when the source that was sexually interested in Mrs. Polby said, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A cassette of voice messages received from her phone at least three times was seized from the house of Molkeira in August 2006.
Investigators also found videos on a private detective's computer where Miss Polby and her sister appeared as "Projects".
During the period she was being followed, Mrs. Polby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, said Mr. Edies.
During this time, former Chief Reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weatherrap were monitoring Mrs. Polby's movements.
After leaving her a voice message on June 18, 2005, he said, "I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow that I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edies said that Coleson's participation in this story was based on the same scenario as other powerful people, such as former Home Minister David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blankett about having an affair with a married woman while he had himself met with a co-defendant, Rebecca Brooks, who was at the time married.
They refuse to conspire with other people to hack their phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulkyre, Turlbeck and Weatherrape have confessed to hacking their phones.
Snowden says he's ready to speak to the authorities of the FGD in the wiretap case.
An ex-CIA officer, Edward Snowden, is willing to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with the authorities of the German government, to convey the RlA News.
A letter from a former member of the U.K.C. to the U.S. government in a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday presented a member of the Bundestag, Hans-Cristian Strebele, through which Snowden handed a message to the German authorities.
Strebel met Snowden the previous day in Moscow.
Four people were injured by a fire in Tver Street
Four passers-by people were injured as a result of a fire in a collector in central Moscow, on Tver Street.
According to Interfax, with reference to a source in the emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, passers-by was affected during a fire in a smoked underground passage.
According to RlA News, referring to the head of the Department of Energy and Energy of the capital, Paul Livinski, the power supply is now fully restored in all the houses on Tver Street.
The fire in the heat collector near home 15 on Tver Street took place on the evening of October 31st.
There was a strong smoke coming out of the leaky sewer hatches, and a smoke broke out in the underground passage at the Armenia store.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tver Street had been demolished.
At 9:45 a.m. Moscow time, the fire was destroyed.
US cuts in the food allowance for the poor
The meal allowance for a family of four is reduced by 36 dollars per month
Since Friday, US finances for food stamps known as "Foodsteps" have been declining, as a government program ends.
A family of four will now be allocated 36 dollars a month less than previously, according to officials.
This will affect 47 million poorer Americans.
According to Reuters, in FY 2012 the average allowance per person was $133 per month.
Food aid spending in the United States has risen to 80 billion dollars a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14% of Americans rely on free food aid provided by foodsteps, which has been named since the previous year when they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis broke out, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorer Americans.
However, the Republicans in the Congress are demanding further cuts in the programme's resources, arguing that it should be targeted at those who need it most.
The owners of food stores across America are concerned that cuts will reduce consumer spending.
US Congressmen continue to argue about how government funding can be further reduced.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform free of charge
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platform on the PC free of charge.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game became available on Battle.net as part of the classic Blizzard games.
However, some gamers note that only those users whose accounts relate to the American part of the service can now download it.
The game is not yet available for Russian users.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard had just released on the PC is no different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne Platformer, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally appeared on the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and bright kingdom.
One day the dark ruler of Sarlak decided to kill the bright King of Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is Vlaros' son, Keel, who was rescued from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later he went back to Tuul to fight against Sarlack's followers and to protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after its renaming as Blizzard Entertainment.
It was previously called Silicon & Synapse.
The publisher of Blackthorne was Interplay.
There will be new machines in Moscow subway.
But selling tickets to passengers isn't for money, they're for sitting.
One trip worth 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger 30 secludes.
The number of sitting-rooms will calculate a special device using modern technology, reports ITAR-TASS with a reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first machine will be installed at the exhibition station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of the new tickets, the President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Zhukov, and the champions of Alexei Nemov and Helena the Younger, will host the presentation.
Recognition by the National Security Agency increases corporate paranoia with regard to State surveillance
On a warm day late in August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
In accordance with the instructions of the German National Security Service (BfV), he was assigned to photograph the roof of the United States Mission building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Boones Bank.
The German media say that BfV was hoping to find the antennes of listening devices, and this action led to talks between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of US National Security, again confirmed in September that the US did not use foreign intelligence to steal foreign companies' business secrets in the interest of US companies to improve their international competitive performance or to increase their profitability.
But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who has become a whistle-blower, has begun to publish his treasure of US intelligence secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure if the director can be trusted.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was following the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data stored by US cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised corporate paranoia caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was to report that the telephone of chancellor Angela Merkel had been tapped for perhaps 10 years.
If Europe's most powerful person can become a target, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden made it clear that there was extensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I think it's likely that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany has to wake up," says Oliver Grew, president of the BITMI association, representing Germany's small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies believe that the US now represents almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial spying and data theft, according to a July study published by the EY consulting agency.
However, there was still no evidence in all the documents that Mr. Snowden had discovered that the US had handed over commercial secrets to its own companies.
The politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks some information technology and Internet capabilities and felt that it should try to reduce its addiction to the US.
Businessmen are sceptical about this.
Someone in the German Parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"That's not an option," said Gasso Plattner, president of a German software company for SAP business.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidies in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the scope and technical development of US spy agencies, which became famous for Snowden's discoveries, was a shock to some companies that had previously thought that China represented the greatest risk of surveillance.
A big shift is taking place in cloud technology, where European companies have become more aware that data stored in the US are under the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study carried out by the Cloud Security Association, about 10 percent of its non-American members declined their plans to use a cloud provider based in the United States after exposing the US software for the intellectual analysis of Pricem data.
Jim Sneib, one of SAP's Executive Directors, said, "We see consumers asking a new question that didn't occur a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction."
Many German leaders argue that recent reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore they must be protected at any cost.
What happens to economic espionage is not surprising.
It's always happened.
"This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed much in the current debate," said Kurt Bok, Chief Executive Director of the BASF chemical company.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially, and we are spying on them too, because it is part of our national interests to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders generally do not like to brag about the responses they have made, as this may give an advantage to the opponent.
In large companies, the idea of taking a free drive at the exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room is at least unthinkable.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the Audi Automobile Construction Company, said that it had been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they could not be used as listening devices.
The German Federal Constitution Protection Service recommends that companies should consider using simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign trips because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and tracking.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in their particular jobs.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from illegal access,” warns BfV.
The US warns its own companies about economic spying from other countries.
In February, the US national intelligence report placed France, together with Russia and Israel, in a second series of hackers engaged in economic intelligence after China, asserts The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic spying, the French are the worst.
Bernard Scarcini, former head of the DCI, said in an interview this month: "Services know perfectly well that all countries, even when cooperating in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
The parents of a youth from Georgia who died on a "failed accident" think their son was killed
The parents of a youth from Georgia, whose body was found inside a folded sports mat in his high school gymnasium, believed that their son had been killed, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnston from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January in a vertical mat sitting in the back of his high school sports hall.
Investigators at the county sheriff's office found that Johnsson died in a tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old teenager challenged it.
"They're absolutely sure their son was killed," said FoxNews.com, Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kennet and Jacqueline Johnston.
They never believed he died as the sheriff said.
"They think it's contrary to logic, physics, and common sense," Crump said.
They think it's a cover to protect a person or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a corpse bag," he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore announced on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into the death of Johnston, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts wherever they come from.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I hold the view that there are sufficient grounds” for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the primary autopsies showed that Johnston died as a result of "positional asphyxiation".
However, the second postmortem, according to Moore, showed another cause of death.
“There are a few issues to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to warrant a criminal or civil investigation into the death of Johnston, he would ask the F.B.I. to conduct it.
The LAPD sheriff was not available for comment when he was contacted on Thursday.
South Georgia's judge ordered the authorities on Wednesday to publish all the videos of the surveillance cameras that the investigators were looking at.
The teenager's parents said they hoped that the videos contained the key to finding out how he died.
"Spartake": For information about persons who hung up fascist symbols
The official website "Spartaka" published a statement by the Moscow Club concerning the appearance of a fascist flag on the stand in Jaroslavla.
"On October 30, at the Chinnick Cup game, "Spartake" was shown by unknown provocateurs at the Yaroslavla Stadium by fascist symbols.
We call upon all who have reliable information about the persons who committed this criminal offence to provide it.
"The reward is guaranteed," says the statement.
Looking for fans who hung a fascist flag in Jaroslavla
Remember, in the 1/16 finals of the Russian Shinnik Cup, "Spartake" was interrupted several times because of the riots on the stands.
A fascist symbol was also shown in the Spartaca fans' sector.
In the form of a punishment, the Spartak can have about three games without an audience.
There will be a meeting of the committee on Friday.
If you have information about who passed and hung this symbol, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools on child allergic behaviour
On Wednesday, disease control and prevention centers published a list of recommendations for controlling allergic foods in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations that the U.S. government has issued, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One of the 20 children in the United States is now allergic to food.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the incidence of food allergies among children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The manual provides information to schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff about the food allergic behaviour of children and how to help with allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline reserves, most commonly used for injecting, using EpiPen's automatic medical syringe, to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The state governments have recently amended the regulations to allow schools to supply adrenaline with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "It feels like something's sticking into my tongue," "it feels like I have hair in my tongue," or "the tongue is pinching."
The parents of intersex children can choose an “undefined sex”
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born with intermediate sexual organs.
Newborns will no longer be required to be male or female.
The new law does not require parents to identify any sex of such children by allowing parents to specify sex as “undefined” or “undefined” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who could hastily decide on sex surgery and to prevent discrimination against intersex persons.
One intersex person, according to BBC, said many years later, "I'm not a man or a woman."
I'll remain a doctor-created squirrel with bruises and scars.
About one in two thousand children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that are diagnosed as “sexual abuse” -- a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (eachers or seeds) or unusually developed external sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson was probably an intersexual.
Gender identity has not been sufficiently studied yet, but most experts in the United States say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and to attribute it to it than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of a child before the operation, if any.
The New York shrink, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said that the new German law " sounds like a good idea."
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening abuses that require prompt intervention, but most children don't,” he said.
You can take the sex without surgery and then see how the person develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not very precise.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a puzzle about why people can be homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex persons as distinct from transsexual or transgender persons, since their condition was not gender-specific, but biological, which was not exclusively male or female, but was typical of both.
These characteristics can be found in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and body placement; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genetics; or in the structure of chromosome and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, violence and crimes based on prejudice.
Boys with gender bias now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to put men, women or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Walby, became the world's first man to be recognized as a "no-featured" man, holding down in court the right to maintain an "undefined" sexual status for the rest of his life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use the third digit in addition to M and F to X, i.e. intersexual.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still at odds, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers, a prominent Catholic country, signed a petition to remove the “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also disagreed with the German law, saying that "in a situation where the world is caught up in a new state where sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning two more layers of civilization."
One mother of a newly born child from Maryland also informed the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have children set at birth.
"It's hard enough to have a child without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child," she said to the parent's website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sexual organs were called Hermaphrodites, a beautiful Greek god who had the characteristics of both genders.
And just a decade ago, the health community saw gender as a sheet that could erase everything and then paint it again.
But now many people challenge the ethical basis for surgery, knowing that gender identity is difficult, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice without knowing how a child will perceive the sex he or she has acquired when he or she grows up.
"In the middle of the twentieth century it was called an "emergency mental illness," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a shrink; you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate-type genetics was suggested by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easy to change.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and argued that the signals of the environment, including the social — the way parents raise a child — interact with the child's genes and hormones to determine whether a person would consider himself to be a man or a woman.
But in one case in '66, known as John/Joan, his theories were in doubt.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis had been damaged during the negligent circumcision, to castrate the child completely, also removing his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of a transition, but it wasn't," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors are still "using this model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex-change operations declared themselves "dissatisfied with the result."
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY men's chromosome, but with intermediate-type genetics.
The doctors could not determine exactly whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that he would never be able to live a man's "full life."
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external sexual organ and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He began to have female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said to ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was assigned to Vaginaplastics.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found out was awful.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for the normal development of genetics.
Once he learned the truth, he became a man again, getting shots of testosterone and removing his breast.
The operation made him sterile.
Today he advocates for others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexuality.
But Ann Temar-Mattis, the Executive Director of the California Law Association, is concerned that German law is "enhancing labels and stigma."
"Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an "undefined sex," she said.
We fear that it will contribute to interference.
We think it's best to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we haven't seen how this law will work, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Themar-Mattis said that her organization supported the Australian law because "it allows adults to make a choice in favour of the third sex."
“People must be able to make their own decisions about formal sex,” she says.
The German law means that it is acquired upon birth.
It's a battle in which little children shouldn't go into at this stage.
When they grow up, they'll be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a mammologist in Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual disorder and who helps hundreds of other people in a support group, said that German law would “support” both parents and children.
Barac's daughter, Cathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual disorder called the "androgen insensitivity syndrome".
Since her androgenous recipes are not working properly, Cathy has developed female symptoms.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Cathy is married and is intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to be a parent through adoption or gestatic surrogate.
"The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves," said Baraz.
It gives them time to do some analysis and to understand the situation, as well as the time before they write "male" or "female".
In that case, you are okay — raising a child, loving a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel happy.
We don't have to rush a surgery that's irreversible.
"It allows children to participate in the decision and removes the anxiety that drives parents because they don't feel like they're doing the right thing," she said.
After all, the child will decide which sex he or she is more comfortable with — and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
Nikolai Habiboulin, the gatekeeper of Chicago, stressed that he must play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two hawks meetings, Habiboulin first skipped six pucks from Tampa Bay and then four from "Ottawa," and in the second game it was replaced after the fourth missed puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I failed to do so, - quotes CSNChicago's word Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in the exercises, probably need to approach them as games, and try to achieve a better result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings you've had.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in practice, I feel quite decent.
But somehow, after a few heads, it turns into some sort of snowcoma.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The gatekeepers--I don't think I'm the only one--are always trying to do the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not excited.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself to keep the puck on.
It's great that my same-clubs support, but basically it's simple: I have to play better.
Two games isn't the whole season, but I wanted to do them a lot better.
But it happened.
I have to put it aside.
I'll just try to win the next match better.
A flight bus crashed on Altaya.
In the Rubtsov district of Altai, a bus of APC crashed.
As a result of the accidents, 13 people were reported to the MES Regional Office.
The region's law enforcement authorities had previously reported 10 victims.
According to the agency, the accident occurred about 9 a.m. local time on the Novonikolaevka-Vysnevka road, 1 km from Novonikolayevka.
There were 12 passengers and drivers in a bus from Rubtsovska to Vishnevka, all of whom suffered injuries of varying severity and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were brought to City hospital No. 1 Rubtsovska, and two were hospitalized at the RBK Rubtsovska.
Medvedev expected an SSJ-100 plane to be shipped to Europe
Russia hopes that, once superjet 100 aircraft are secured into Latin America and Asia, they will be shipped to Europe.
"We expect in general that we will receive such arrangements by more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type," quotes Interfax the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at a press conference with French premier Jean-Marc Ero.
The head of the Russian government said that there was serious cooperation with French colleagues, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some of the financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once the aircraft is enhanced in Latin America and Asia and the Pacific, it will also be presented to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he'll ever go to France," stressed the Russian premier.
SSJ-100 is a plane built by Civil Dry Flights in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is based on modern technology and offers high standards of quality and comfort in a segment of 100 passenger places.
Dnipropetrachnia's energy has begun a unique program to save... the nests of the oysters.
In the old age, the villagers placed a wheel on a high stake from the cart to bring the squirrel to the court, and the heavy nest held well on it.
These special supports have been abandoned for a long time, so the storks have enjoyed the poles of the power transmission lines, and the bound branches are based on wires, so that the aystic house is secure.
Anja's grandmother, whose home in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrikov district had been home for twenty years, began to notice how the nest was settling, despite the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new sticks on top, and the bottom layer is already lying between the wires, and it's about to collapse.
Of course, it's a pity for the family of storks who nested in the courtyard every year, to take out and feed three or four birds in the summer, but they don't want to be left without light.
As soon as the birds flew off to the warm places, Anja's grandmother called the Royal RPP, which owns the support.
I didn't even expect to be able to react so quickly.
When our experts arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still running, said Sergei Berezovsky, DTEC's technical director, Dnepropolenergo.
On the wires, which were actually inside a nest weighing 150 to 200 kilograms, the corrosive effect began.
At any time, birds could have died from electric discharge.
And the locals risked losing light because of the damage to the wires.
So linear monthers started a nest rescue operation, not for the first time in our practice.
Ornithologists from Dnipropetrov National University have helped, and they have developed a nesting scheme.
They also held training sessions for district network officers.
Alexander Ponomarenko, a famous ornithologist of daytime, has been consulting the energy industry at all stages of nest reconstruction.
It was estimated that in the area more than 50 atypical apartments were in an emergency state.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms have been made, similar to the vortex.
The foundation was splashed with branches of ivory and then moved there by an old nest.
According to experts, it is enough to put the old branches together as a basis for birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
Then the storks will build their own dwelling.
A month ago, the first nest was rebuilt in the village of Sandkók of the Neunosko district.
A new iron concrete column was installed next to the electric propellant and placed on it a platform with an old, worn nest.
The whole operation cost nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day, the same housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrikovski district in the courtyard of Ani's grandmother.
This is where the platform was fixed, just raised above the wires.
Ornithologists believe that cautious, conservatory birds will not even notice in spring that their apartment has been renovated.
By the end of the year, four more nests are expected to be rebuilt in the Pocharod and Czartic districts of the Dnipropetrovk region.
By the way, while some rescue rare birds, others kill them ruthlessly.
Recently, the whole area was overrun by a sad news: in the village of Ust-Kamenk of the Apostolic Region, on the day of the launch of the pheasant hunt, poachers shot up a swan family living on the local pond for entertainment.
The noble birds were not afraid of the people at all; the natives fed them and did not hurt them.
When the villagers heard the shots, they ran to the pond, four beautiful swans were already lying dead on the water.
Apostolic police officers are now investigating who shot the birds in the Red Book.
The Russian March is getting more popular.
On November 4th, on National Unity Day, Moscow will be held in agreement with the Russian March Bureau.
According to the Levada Center poll, support for the Russian Marchs is growing, with 40% of the citizens having different degrees of approval.
According to the Levada Center, 40% of the citizens have different degrees of approval for the Russian Marchs, 11% of whom are certainly positive and 29% are “promptly positive”.
The popularity of the Russian March has gradually increased, with only 14% of Russians having been welcomed in 2006 and twice as many citizens (28%) having supported such activities in December 2010.
"Absolutely negative" means only 7% Russians, and "negatively negative" means 19%.
A further 35 percent were unable to express their views on this action.
This year, Moscow's City Hall agreed on a Russian March of up to 15,000 people in Ljublino, which was reported today by the head of the security department of the capital, Alexei Majorov.
This nationalist action has taken place every year on National Unity Day since 2005.
In response to a question from the sociologists, "Did you hear that on November 4th, Russian marches are being held in Russia under the motto of protecting Russian rights in Russia?" three quarters (75%) of the citizens replied negative.
Only one in five Russians (20%) knows about this stock.
It is remarkable that in December 2010 almost one third of the citizens (31 per cent) heard about the Russian Marchs.
Remember, on December 11th, a natural nationalist rally took place on the Manages Square three years ago, which turned into a riot.
The Levada Center also asked the Russian what holiday was celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of people who know the right answer (National Unity Day) rose from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15 per cent of citizens are attending the holiday.
About the same (17%) plan to celebrate November 7th Day of the October Revolution.
Most citizens (62 per cent) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How Moscow's City Hall agreed on a Russian March in Lublino
On October 28, the capital authorities agreed to a Russian March on November 4 in Ljublino.
This was reported by the leader of the Russian association, the organizer of Dmitry Demushkin's march.
In addition to the Ljublino walk, there will be a rally and a Corrot concert on the Day of National Unity, also agreed with the authorities.
How did the "Russian March 2012" go?
On the 2012 National Unity Day, nationalists marched from the Yakiman Coast to the Central House of Artists, where a rally took place.
The organisers estimated the number of participants to be 20,000, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs referred to the number of 6,000.
Communication: Obama's election office was considering the release of Biden in favour of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest counsellors were secretly considering the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 election list.
This discovery is the most striking sensation of all expected books by Mark Halperin and John Hailemann on the 2012 campaign "The Pieces Doubled: The Game Changed 2012".
The Times had received a copy of a book about to be released and announced on Thursday evening that the President's close assistants had carried out “large-scale research in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether Biden's deletion could help raise the declining hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to political commentator The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by senior officials at the elections and at the White House, the former head of the White House, Bill Daly, to evaluate the effect that the appointment of former government secretary Clinton as Vice President would have on the vote.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected one at the Chicago Election Office and the Oval Office.
Only six of the President's closest counsellors, including Daley, former head of Obama's election office, Jim Messinu, and former senior White House councillors, David Axelrod and David Pluff, knew that the replacement was under consideration.
The book Doubled says that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden, despite their "intimate personal relationship," but eventually refused to do so, when their data showed that adding Clinton to the election list would not "make Obama's chances significant."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Byden Clinton.
"I have been active in favour of considering a lot of things, and it was one of them," said Daily to the newspaper.
You must remember that the president was in a terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh, my God, what do we do?"
While Daley described the study as a "necessary test," Martin told CNN's representative Anderson Cooper that the election office had invested enough in examining whether this step would bring dividends to the vote.
"Electoral offices don't spend that kind of money on interviews and focus groups unless they take something seriously," said Martin in the AK 360 program.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was studying the possibility of replacing.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss knew about a possible altercation.
Although Daley said he did not think that the president was aware of a possible replacement, the former head of administration admitted that Obama knew "perhaps".
Martin added that the Piece Double did not provide a clear answer to the question whether the results of the political scanning had reached Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously believed that Obama had not been aware of the study of the possibility of removing Biden from the election list.
"Perhaps," replied Martin.
Would you like a glow in the dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world's first glowing ice cream in the dark with a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came up with this idea by reading a scientific article about jellyfish, and persuaded scientists in China to re-establish the shining protein chemically.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue of the eater, raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the "Leave me, I'm delicious," says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still at the very beginning, in terms of production, so £200 will give you about two grams of substance."
The squirrel we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue under neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up a squirrel, it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will start glowing.
We've been testing it over the past few months, and it seemed like it would be perfect to introduce it to Halloween because it produces such a wonderful lighting effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the fluorescent jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So every balloon costs me about £140.
But it tastes pretty good.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef, and taste of cosmic gold.
But its next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop invisible ice cream."
That's by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals, which make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses fluorescent jellyfish properties synthesized by Chinese scientists
Avangard coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, referring to his team's preparation for the regular KHL match against Salawat, said that Omichi had carried out a thorough analysis of the damage from the magnetic Metalurg.
The specialist stressed that the Avangarde should be given greater attention to the defence game.
We've been watching a video game against the Magnegorian Metalurg, and this is the official website of the Avantgarde word of Chebaturkin.
- Missed a lot of pucks, not a very nice moment.
Missed because of their mistakes, because of failure to play.
We knew the opponent had artists.
The statistics show that they had five attacks on the move-- three pucks hit us.
Very good implementation.
Have these errors been taken into account in preparing for today's game?
The guys and I are taking each match carefully, we're talking after the game, we're getting ready for a new match.
The key is to make sure the installation is complete.
Everybody saw the first period of the match against Metallurg.
The job was played, and the score was 2:0.
They skipped the ball in the locker room, and in the third period they began to make mistakes.
Given how hard the game was going on, it didn't make any sense to connect advocates.
You have to back off with the whole team.
Now the Avantgard has a long home series, the match goes on in a day, and the team's tired?
All commands are under the same conditions.
The key now is to carry out your moments and to perform the game.
Hockey is an emotional game, and if you do the setup, it's not that hard to solve.
Due to the new rules introduced by Russian Customs, hundreds of furs have been in line for almost a week at the border with Russia.
Today, Donkey officials have promised to provide drivers with drinking water and biota
There were hundreds of furs at border points when they entered Russia.
This was due to a change in the Customs procedure for the goods.
Ukrainian border guards and Customs officers confirmed that the turn was created by a Russian party that had not warned of any new developments in advance.
Since 28 October, Russian Customs authorities have introduced additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, as reported by the deputy chief of Eastern Customs, Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document applies to countries that have become party to the convention on international transport.
Checkpoints are in advanced mode.
FACTOV's correspondent visited the border and contacted long-distance truckers who had been held hostage.
Prices in a road-café shop at the Novoazovsk pass point are rising daily, as is the queue from the fur.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching about two miles away.
The Novoasovsk Customs Terminal - Veselo-Vosenska provides one of the most important transport routes from southern Ukraine on the international highway.
The goods are therefore sent to the Stavropole Province of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Armenia.
On Sunday until midnight, a truck driver named Alexei Govanev, who is transporting a cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan through Russia and is sleeping in his car for almost a week, complains.
By the new rules, to cross the border, I need an extra package of documents and a cargo insurance payment.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance to which they are transported.
Minimum insurance is between 4.5 and 5,000 roubles (about 1100 and 1,300 hryvnias).
Those who drive near (say Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo of up to $50,000 pay about 15,000 roubles (3,800 hryvnias) and drive.
And the rest are stuck because nobody has that much money with them!
Imagine, if a driver carries a cargo worth only $4000, but goes to Moscow, he needs 90,000 roubles (almost 23,000 hryvnia) to pay for the transit!
The conditions for survival at the border -- no, no -- are lamented by long-distance truckers who are set up to eat near their cars.
Border shops and cafes are always expensive, but prices like this have never happened!
The salesmen focused and quickly rolled them up: 15 rye stands for a barn, seven rye for a cup of coffee, and 25 ryeves for a plate of soup.
And there's one cafe.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the stairs, we go to the bathroom.
No washing, no shaving...
I can stay out of the car for a week, and my wife has prepared everything for me on the road.
I'll spend a week comforting myself with another long-distance trucker, Victor Scottenko.
Only will my car get a week's turn?
Why do you have one and a half gallons of water? -- we're interested in the only foreign shop.
There's 11 and 15 hryvnias.
What, is the bottle crystal or is the water insistent on silver?
We have a cafe, not a store.
Take while there's something else, the saleswoman's steaming.
After media coverage began, the plight of Ukrainian drivers was brought to the attention of the authorities in the region.
The leadership of the Ambrosia and Novoas Regional Government was entrusted with providing drinking water to all those who queued on the Ukrainian-Russian border, as declared by the Acting Chairman of the Donetsk Oblast State Department, Sergey Dergunov.
Ambulance teams are now on duty at the crossing points.
Biotools will also be installed for human convenience.
According to the official, the queue problem will be resolved in the coming days.
As of 31 October, 32 and 68 cars were stationed at the international “Uspenka” and “Novoazovsk” passes, according to the Donetsk press service.
"FACTS" will monitor the evolution of the situation.
Vilnius suspect Moscow of attempting to slander the Lithuanian President
Russia intended to carry out information-provocations against Lithuanian dignitaries and Eastern partner countries, a statement which the BNS agency had made in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
Information about this has been published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, Moscow is going to “converse” the Lithuanian President, Dal Grybauskait, and to publish the falsified documents allegedly found in Russian Gosorigiv, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to intelligence services, the Department of Analysis of the Public Processes of the Administration of the President of Russia on Inter-Regional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is responsible for the preparation of an information attack.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Sterenkov, who has visited Lithuania on numerous occasions and participated in the Lithuanian People's Party's Congress.
A member of the department of V. Smirnov is also alleged to be part of the operation.
According to the intelligence service, Smyrnov, under cover of scientific work, regularly visited Lithuania until the end of 2012 and contacted local politicians, political researchers and the media.
Smyrnov is now barred from entering the country.
On the eve of the day, the Lithuanian President, Gribauskait, announced that he was aware of the information that was being prepared for it.
In her view, the main reason was Lithuania's successful presidency of the European Union Council and the country's “genuine energy independence”
The Lithuanian leader had previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities on numerous occasions.
Thus she stated that Lithuania was considered to be “not respectful enough” in the Kremlin.
In addition, the Grybauskait accused the head of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Poetin, of bringing “only requirements” to Lithuania.
Remember, in September Roskilznadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian milk into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the product did not meet health and epidemiological standards.
The Lithuanian leader then said that if Russia did not lift the ban, the government should prepare a request to the World Trade Organization.
In the United States, a school principal fired on teenagers.
The directors of one of the American high schools have literally made teenagers desperate.
The man, he said, had to take a gun and start shooting.
The incident occurred in the State of Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, young bullies dropped the man's house with toilet paper.
As a result, the principal of the school opened fire on teenagers, resulting in several injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the bullies were not on the property of the director, he was charged with assault under grave circumstances.
The man was released on bail at $125,000.
Note that shooting civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the previous day, a man opened a shooting in the middle of Ridgecree in California, California, just down the street.
The perpetrator then took two random passers-by hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Earlier in Newtown Elementary School, Connecticut, there was a shooting.
Adam's mom was a teacher at school.
Shots fired at American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident occurred on 31 January in an American school, this time in Anlant, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

2013 Halloween in numbers
When I was a little girl, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and put up a dressing party for our neighborhood.
Now I'm more of a squirrel.
I haven't called in the past two years to hand out candy in my apartment, and I probably won't this year.
However, statistics show that I'm a white crow in the area of Halloween.
According to the National Federation of Distributive Trades, most Americans, that is, $158 million, will be celebrating this year for a total of $6.9 billion for chocolates, costumes and ornaments.
The only thing I expect every Halloween is the trends.
The National Distributive Federation predicts that it will cost $1.2 billion out of $6.9 billion spent on costumes.
This year at the top of fashion are sexual inanimate objects.
Women are no longer required to be sex workers; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we're going to see a lot of Zs because of "The Walking Dead," and I'm sure that the Dant Punk-style astronauts will fall into our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the costumes that are most frequently sought are the Zs, the Batman, the pirates, and the witches.
Perhaps there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Distributive Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on animal costumes.
That means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't care.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, candy candy, Milk Duds candy, Twizlers chewing candy and Clark Bar candy.
According to the U.S. Department of Trade, that's great news for the 41 million candy kids who are ready to conquer our neighborhoods.
And what's more, we're going to buy -- we're not going to lie to ourselves -- we're going to eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is cornseed candy; and yet, according to the National Association of Conditors, nearly 35 million pounds are sold for Halloween.
This is about nine billion individual corn seeds.
It's a riddle that I still have to solve.
Nothing reflects the nature of Halloween as a haunted house.
They have amazing titles, such as "Awe behind walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "War and shout" and "The House of Shock."
Moreover, according to American Hunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America that generate about $500 million in income, as well as those amazing photos where you almost put down the pictures your friend posted on Facebook and you can't remove, and then the guy you like sees this picture and leaves a comment like, "Cool expression of face."
And we'll finally talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting Jack's lamp is like decorating the Christmas tree, what we've been doing since we were kids.
Fortunately for us, the fashion for a baby in a pumpkin had only begun last year thanks to the Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out those pumpkins rather than sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Population Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack's lamp, slowly drying on your porch, probably came from the state of Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want a harder job, visit Tim and Susan Mathesdon in Napa, California, and try to cut something out of their pumpkin weight of £2032.
The Estonian Ministry of Defence site was restored after an attack by Ukrainian hackers
The site of the Estonian Ministry of Defence was re-established after the morning cyberattack and is reported by the press service of the Department.
According to the Vice-Chancellor of the Ministry of Defence for Information and Administration, Timer Petercope, this was a primitive attack, the site just overloaded with a lot of requests.
Our experts have quickly set things up, and the site has now been rebuilt.
"The Ministry's damage is minimal," said Petershop to the publication Postimees.
According to Petercope, it's too early to talk about who organized the attacks.
"We will certainly analyse the causes of the incident and draw conclusions from it, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents," he acknowledged.
On November 1, the Anonymous Akraine group posted a online message that confirmed the hacking of the Estonian Ministry of Defence and opposed Ukraine's and NATO's partnership.
We want the leadership of NATO to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We must not be servants of the North Atlantic.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of the member countries of the North Atlantic Organization.
Ukraine doesn't need the North Atlantic bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia either.
Ukraine should not be anyone's slave.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
"Hands away from Ukraine," says Anonymous.
The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine had previously reported that the company of the Marines of the Teodosian Separate Battalion of the Ukrainian Marines would take part in the military-command exercises of the NATO reaction force, Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Because of the violence of unclean force, several schools and a hospital had to be closed.
Four schools in South Matabeleland, Zimbabwe, had to be closed because students had been attacked by... goblins.
As the local elder explained, the children were in a panic and it was impossible to continue their studies.
The story of goblins may sound like a dream of a child for a European, but in Africa this is a very serious argument for school shutting down.
Adults are also afraid of unclean power.
In the summer, for example, a hospital in Zimbabwe was closed because medical staff were also attacked by goblins.
Launched of the Land Rover race series
Inside are racing seats and six-point safety-belts, as well as an internal communications system.
In addition, you can obtain improved brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, technical support and car storage between events.
Drew Bauler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said, "The Rollers who go to Bowler have changed."
Some of them are not experienced drivers, but people who seek excitement, adventures and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try different Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and reality of the Rally Road.
We had a great pleasure in developing the Defender Challenge car -- it's going to be a really exciting championship.
Defender Challenge also provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as an opportunity to take part in events in the desert in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian soldiers don't know anything about the "Brother Circle"-New News
This is written by INTERFAX.RU, referring to an informed source in Russian law enforcement agencies.
"After media reports of the US Department of Finance placing Leps on the watch lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate 'Bruther Circle', we looked through all the databases, but no such group was found," said the agent.
In his view, the dissemination of this information contributed to maintaining the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which allegedly operated abroad.
As previously reported "No," yesterday the U.S. Department of Finance published on its website a list of alleged members of the "Brother Circle" criminal group.
Among them was the Russian singer Gregory Leps.
He appears on the list as "Greech," put out the previous day.
They match the data of a popular Russian artist.
The exact name is Gregory Lepsevride, creative alias, place and date of birth.
Besides Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, an Uzbek citizen, and another former USSR citizen whose nationality is unknown.
In the U.S., Gregory Leps, who lives on Phuket Island, is confident that he was transporting money for the bandits on their orders.
This report contains a picture of the singer and all his relevant data.
Moreover, Leps did recently buy a house on Phuket.
The department indicated that it intended to penalize Leps.
Putting a person on a blacklist in the U.S. Ministry of Finance results in the freezing of his assets in the US and a ban on business contacts with him by people living in the United States.
Leps' assistant Maya Serikov said that no notification was received to the singer: "It's hard to answer the question whether it's the Gregory that everybody's talking about now in connection with the US scandal."
All Leps knows is media information.
He was not personally notified, although I do not know if they occur in such cases.
"And, of course, this is all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other -- surprising and unexpected," she said to RlA News.
According to her, Gregory Leps does not live on Phuket, but according to the U.S. Department, he does have a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps was currently on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him on a flight to the city of Blaevettensk.
Runnin' out on the field in a chinnik game.
There were some details of the identity of the fan who ran out on the field during the 1 or 16th finals of the Russian Cup between the Jaroslav Shinnik and the Moscow Spartak.
As the head of the CDC, Arthur Grigorianz, said, referring to data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is Moscow.
He's currently in custody.
"In addition, Gregoriant spoke of how the fan managed to break through the field: "It turns out that this one, we call him a viewer, went to the emergency room accompanied by two viewers, citing heart problems.
He went to the E.R. -- that was confirmed by the E.R. doctor.
And then he pushed two chaperones away and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the Eastern and South tributaries to the corner of the Eastern and Northern tributaries.
He ran through all the fields.
The stewards are responsible for this.
Before the law on sports comes into force, it's a flight attendant's zone -- the police can't interfere with what's in the field.
He ran up to the stands, climbed over the East stands.
And during that time there were riots on the East Side and on the trails," said the head of the KDC.
Recall that by decision of the KDC, the Moscow Spartak will hold the upcoming matches of Russia's 15th Tour against the Locomotive and Zenita, and will pay a fine of 600,000 roubles.
The fire brigades were called to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous career.
Ruby's Coker-Spaniel ran away after she had a little accident.
Three days later, she was caught in a career and noticed by a dog walker.
The firemen came down on a rope on a mountainside to save the dog from imminent death
The puppy was lucky to escape after the fire brigades had been called to lift it up and deliver it to a safe place, after it somehow stuck at a height of 50 feet on the dangerous slope of the euphorous slope.
Ruby's nine-month-old coker-spaniel ran away after she had had a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before she was rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her master, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend, Becca Hall, were at the Fleppet's career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and rescue services.
They were feverishly searching for their missing dog and posting messages on social media sites after she ran off to the quarry after a small accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a star dog driver spotted Ruby stuck at a height of 50 feet in his career.
A technical rescue team from the Clekhiton fire station hurried to the scene, came down on the ropes to save Ruby, and used a transporter to lift her up the slope.
Andy Clayton, a rescue officer, said, "She was in a dangerous situation."
It was right in the middle of a slope of 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move her muscle during the rescue; she's completely frozen.
But now she's fine.
Then she ate biscuits.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
Peter Lau, a rescue officer, said, "Ruby is very lucky to be rescued."
There was a possibility that she might have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinary for a check-up, and it was found that she was all right, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Mrs. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "Keep watching the rescue was frightening."
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when we got her back in our hands.
The Veterinary said that if she had fainted and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firemen were great.
It was very bold what they did.
We're so grateful, and each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson from Kitley added: "We were afraid she might fall, but she remained there."
The firemen were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he wasn't flirting with Cathy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, a pop star stated that she was a backup singer for the 2004 Jagger song Old habits die Hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a rocker-veteran, and she said, "He was flirting with me when I was 18.
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of 70-year-old Jagger said that he “kategoryly denied that he had ever hit Cathy Perry."
The representative added: "Perhaps she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones Tour this year.
Her new album, Prism, debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Breaking up with Europe gives the Scots a choice
One more day, another fear of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the European Free Movement Zone as a condition of EU membership.
There is a series of stories about passport controls in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along Adrian's shaft.
True, the Strathclide newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movement in the rest of Europe, although, predictably, it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor did anyone indicate that EU member countries spend a great deal of time turning their formal rules around as they please.
Since Scotland is no longer part of the Schengen zone, continued non-observance will be a cheap yield for Brussels in exchange for what he really wanted from the Scots.
So it's a neglected story.
And it's so old that it's become a fossil: for the first time I've heard "the duck" of "independentness means passport control," at least 40 years ago.
And yet there's an interesting moment lost in the story of an ancient story.
Why should an independent Scotland obey Europe's orders?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With Eurocrisis, the Europe project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union parties opposed to the EU or for the euro to be abolished as a single currency are gaining power.
Even in Germany, the "Alternative for Germany" party, founded only this year, came out of nowhere and won almost five million votes at the September federal elections, thus essentially pushing the "Free Democrans" (an analogue of our "Liberal Democracy") out of the Bondstag.
There was always an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis was a turning point.
The austerity measures introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the chains placed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency led many people to think that the Europe project had gone too far.
The euro crisis had little to do with the fact that national governments were working under excessive budget constraints, which was only fair for Greece.
In fact, the Euro system has blocked its members for exchange rates that are advantageous to German exporters, which German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe finds itself at a predetermined disadvantage in terms of production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut wages and public spending, which Berlin actively supports.
Behind the current problems of the budget and currency lies the deeper problem of Europe's productive capacities.
As a result of the Green Energy package introduced by Brussels, a cipher that means subsidies to French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the United States.
It's a paralyzing poor price environment, as we've seen in Granjmut.
No freeze in the world will stop the devastating victory of US cheap slate gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, there is a revolt, especially in France, once by the most violent party to the EU.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and to place Paris at the same level as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already forced its own economic policy into Europe, leaving France's corrupt economy in distress.
The result is a right-wing anti-European party, Marin Le Pen, the National Front, just won decisive additional elections by putting the ruling party of socialists on third place.
Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the vote — a prompt warning to British labourers that a right-wing division cannot be assumed to automatically affect the left.
What does LePen do with his newly acquired popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to create a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If -- and that's very likely -- anti-European parties get support in these elections, that bloc will be able to dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
Here's my point: the growing mood against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will unite to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become a sort of vague “European (trusted) nation” that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several dependent economies may save the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I assume that Britain is distanced from this project, hoping to get closer to the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be neglected in the cold Atlantic.
In what position does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in fact) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect Scotland will succeed in a more free European agreement, provided that we retain our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-Federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider resuming Norway's experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful political movement in Europe against the austerity measures that gained an enormous majority of votes in 2011 due to objections to the cost cuts offered (and realized) by the LBJ, Alistair Darling, and which was subsequently created by the Tory and the liberal democrats' coalition.
Scotland would now be ridiculous to vote for independence only in order to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Aging before
African-American and Latin-American girls generally reach puberty before their white peers do research.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is near
There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
The experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the trigger mechanisms for early puberty
The tendency towards early puberty is not so pronounced among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Eterage is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should the mother be frightened if her daughter begins to form breasts and grow puberty at age 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, the child endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplowitz explained that these early physical changes are common among American girls and represent a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time soothing parents -- usually it doesn't mean the rapid rise of full puberty," said Caplowitz.
Visible signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and octal hair, and the smell of the body, appear before the girls.
But there has been only a small shift in menarche age (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and has fallen from 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breast begins to develop, it's at least two or three years before the menarche," said Caplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Children's sexual maturity: how to cope with this widespread problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is a discussion of what is the actual occurrence of puberty, but it is considered to be “pre-emptive” when breast increases are accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to eight years.
In most cases the process will slow down or slow down, which is that the paediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progress can provide a basis for analysis by an endocrinologist to avoid serious problems such as tumours or cystics.
There are procedures to slow down early menstruation and prevent another consequence: early aging bones, which can eventually lead to slower growth and low growth as adults.
The recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, level of development, rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
The capwitz is careful with the drugs, but admits that “addiction of puberty can reduce the behavioural problems and feelings of girls that they are different from those of their peers”.
Another big problem is that parents just don't want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They're worried about the risk of being pregnant or even how they're going to handle health issues," Caplowitz said.
"It was a shock," remembers one woman whose daughter had begun her menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school frightened and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many popular theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are responsible for milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys, like girls, have early puberty.
Caplowitz claims that the assumption that has the greatest weight is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, it contributed to a study of girls between 6 and 9 years of age, which linked the amount of fat in their body to the period of puberty.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latin-American girls generally reach puberty before their white peers.
There are different explanations.
Worldwide, early puberty seems to be affected by everything, from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another riddle is that while boys have a younger age of hair on their faces and puberty, the tendency to mature completely early is not as pronounced as girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair occurs even in babies and children of crème age.
"We must be careful how we determine the true occurrence of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at Gorieb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
The parents should not be ashamed to receive instructions from a paediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean an earlier than expected conversation," explained Caplowitz.
If you remain calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who bloom early need confirmation that even when they do so before they do, this process is a normal part of life.
A United States Boeing stuck in Cheeta preparing for flight
As part of the Open Sky Treaty, the United States aircraft, which flew over Russian territory and landed unplanned on Wednesday in Chita on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 a.m. Moscow time, will leave the city's air harbor.
The airport authorities allowed the flight to take off after receiving fuel money.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan Ude.
According to other data, he'll be going to the United States.
A flight to Ulaan-Udeh was reported to have landed in Zabaikal Province due to a fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita airport.
There are 30 people on board, including the crew, who spent two nights on the airport, reporting ITAR-TASS.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, under the terms of the Open Sky Treaty, persons on board an aircraft are not allowed to go outside the Chita airport; they can only pass border control at two airports in Russia, in Cuba and in Ulaan-Ude.
The Open Sky Treaty was signed in 1992 and has 34 States parties.
Observer flights take place over Russia, the United States, Canada, and Europe.
The main tasks of the Treaty are to develop transparency, to help monitor the implementation of arms control agreements, and to improve the capacity to prevent crises and address crises within the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and other international organizations.
How much do the late celebrities earn-- MK in the U.S. MK
The highest-earning life celebrity rating in 2013 was led by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But it was overtaken by the late Michael Jackson, whose post-mortem income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million.
The other celebrities who left last year's "earnings" are lagging behind him a few times less.
The second in the list of the most well-functioning celebrities published by the Forbes magazine was Elvis Presley, 55 million a year, and the line below was the author of the Peanuts comic books, Charles Schultz, with 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, former leader of last year's 25 million, and musician Bob Marley (18 million) were included in the first five.
The list was also made up of Maryline Munro, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.
Moscow opened the first boutique of Igor Guilleume
On October 23, the opening of Igor Guliev's first flagman boutique in Moscow took place.
Designer Igor Guilleume is known to the general public for his magnificent suites of suite fur.
And now more fashion fans can appreciate them -- in Moscow, his first boutique was finally opened, and the designer gave a dolce vita party.
I'm sure there are the most beautiful girls in Russia.
So I'm particularly glad that I have a shop in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
That's the way Igor cut the red ribbon and invited all those who wanted to... try on the fancy models!
Jet industry fights about the width of the seat when large orders are at stake
There was a fierce dispute between the leading aircraft industry over the width of the tourist-class seats on long voyages, setting the tone for the violent confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of the seats provided on long-range flights to the economy-class passengers whose interests are not always at the centre of the airfares' attention, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the claims of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for a industry standard that would provide for a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economy-class salon, but its main American rival Boeing says it should be decided by the airfares.
The dispute is taking place at a time when aircraft growers are competing in the sale of larger versions of their two-engine long-range jets, and at the event of 17-21 November, potentially record orders are expected.
The layout of the rear of the plane, especially whether 9 or 10 people sit in row, is central to the statements of the economic efficiency of the new mini-airbus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will contain 406 people, based on seats in an economic class more than 17 inches wide, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class on 18 inches wide seats, 9 in a row.
Airfaring giants often exchange technical strikes through advertisements in the professional press.
Airbus now addresses the public directly before the Dubai air show, where 777X is expected to become a leader with over 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the beginning of a new advertising war might be by showing the financiers a slide showing three people in a restaurant pressed together, called "Would you agree to that?"
"Boeing offers long-range seat flights more narrowly than Regional Turbo-wing aircraft," said the Airbus sales manager, John Leahy.
With a change in diet, people gain weight, but the plane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the broad-based Boeing 747 set standards for modern long-distance travel, and the border of the century, the weight of the average American man between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The average U.S. man's waist of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus claims that her competitor follows the 1950s seat concept, when the average waist of those recently called the "reactive public" was already there.
Airbus says she ordered a study showing that an extra inch in the width of the seat improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing challenges the Airbus figures by seat size and says that the industry should not interfere with decisions on how to find a balance between fares and conveniences.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the cabin does not depend solely on the width of the seat.
“It's really about giving air companies a choice and an opportunity to do what they think they need to do to succeed,” said Boeing in the Kent Craver salon.
They don't want us to decide for them, which will bring them any profit.
They know what they're doing better than anybody else.
For passengers, the question is to increase the space on the sides, but for providers it is becoming a factor that can affect the returns.
Behind this dispute lies a race to order planes, estimated at at least $700 billion at key prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio of American to European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, seating is precisely what fuels the rivalry in the battle between the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing have announced a 20 percent increase in profitability by one in their last two-engine long-range models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared Boeing characteristics are partly based on a comparison of the 10-seated 777X series with the original 9-seat set of the 777 design series.
The profit in unit costs decreases when compared to the 10-seat layout currently used.
"The reason Boeing does this is to squeeze more space and make his plane more competitive than we do," said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with complete 10-seat rows for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense landing that can go hand in hand with lower fares.
"The seat of 18 inches wide would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that commercially, the offer of Airbus is caused by a threat from the 777th model," said Mary Kirby, an interior specialist, the founder and editor of Runway Gill Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply chairs, but offer a directory of providers from which air companies can choose.
The world-wide jet salesmen even carry rolls to check competing plans.
In order to be comfortable, all industry providers also offer aircraft with very tight layouts for budget airfares and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 rows, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus had stressed the need for additional modifications of the cabins, offering larger passage spaces on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “fly” but may distract attention from the wave of sales of the 777X model.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine can rob the smoking process of pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could rob them of smoking cigarettes of pleasure.
One dosage of the vaccine was able to protect mice from lifetime nicotine addiction.
Further tests are needed before human testing begins, which will take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Whale Cornell Medical School in New York said that the first results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a strategy for the use of a vaccine can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it by these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then produce a stable stream of antibodies.
Antibodies track any molecules of nicotine in the blood, neutralize them before they reach the brain, prevent the smoker from getting nicotine.
In the tests, the immunized mice, who were later given nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And the mice that were not given the cure were "relaxed," and that's a sign that nicotine was reaching their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in Science Traditional Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines had failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, the shots had to be made so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably going to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibodies factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human cure were entirely safe, it could be given to children before they wanted to try a cigarette, avoiding nicotine addiction.
But more likely it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the nicotine, and that might help them get rid of that habit," he said.
British researchers said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Oleinikov: third of the villages of Pod Moscow
The vice-governor of Pod Moscow, Yuri Oleinikov, stated that almost a third of the villages in Moscow region were entirely grant-based
A total of 187 out of 288 villages receive subsidies from the region's budget.
In 2013, 187 out of 288 villages received subsidies from the Regional Budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget of the 122 rural villages exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent in the grant.
As part of the budget, about 25 billion rubles are allocated from the district budget," said Oleinikov.
The vice-governor also pointed out that only three towns - Solitsj, Lone and Pushkino - have a budget of more than 1 billion roubles in 2013.
The income of rural villages in many areas is less than 3 million roubles, "that's not enough."
The cost of maintaining a local administrative apparatus in 88 villages in Pod Moscow is over 70%, with “deficient quality of services” observed Oleinikov.
He had previously instructed the heads of the city of Pod Moscow to consider, before the end of November, which villages needed to be merged, merged into the city district or changed the administrative system.
These suggestions will be completed by the end of January.
Earlier, the governor of Moscow had stated that administrative reform in Pod Moscow planned to reduce the number of rural grant villages.
Also in the Mojay, Kashir, Solar, Columen, Luboerts and Kotelniks regions, there is a request for a merging of the municipalities.
This issue will be discussed in cities and areas in the region in November.
The President of the Ministry of National Development, Igor Brynzalov, also said that about 30 rural villages in 12 districts of Moscow were planning to unite all in the coming Admortal.
This is due to the fact that of the 178 rural villages in Moscow less than a third have a “acceptable” financial base and 100 have a grant base.
Diana Arbenin celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenin does not hide the great pleasure she derives from raising her children.
Although Arbenin is now particularly time-consuming in creativity and social activity, she still finds the opportunity to deal with Martha and Artem, not only spending time on their education but also entertaining them as she can.
In the past week, Diana has twice reported to her fans about her educational talents.
She first posted a picture on Facebook that shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday, I spoiled my fans showing me how Artem and Martha dressed up for Halloween.
For the broom racing is ready! our first Halloweyen"--that's what Diana called a picture of her children dressed in holiday costumes.
Which is unwise, for they, like any other Russian boy or girl, have something to do with this holiday because they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce an "undefined sex" when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow registration of children born of Hermaphrodites instead of male or female children to say "undefined".
The child's parents will have the right to leave the "sex" on the birth certificate unfilled for a while.
Instead of "F" (female) or "M" (male) parents can temporarily write "X" (undefined).
The aim of this decision is to prevent parents from rushing into sex-specific surgery.
Statistics show that one in the 2,000 babies in the world is born with hermaphrodite.
Tripodie denies being influenced by Obaid
Former New South Wales Minister of Labor, Joe Tripodi, will be a member of the State's anti-corruptive oversight body.
Former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, denied the change in the lease of the maritime facilities at the request of his political mentor, Mr. Eddy Obaid, who had secretly held shares in three properties on public land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obaid had lobbied several State Ministers to extend leases to Cercular Kee, where the Obaid family owns two restaurants and cafes, without taking a tender after their expiry in August 2005.
It is now examining the claims that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obaid's secret participation in the real estate, following the testimony given by the former deputy head of administration, Mr. Tripodi Lynn Ashpool, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease be presented for open competition.
The tenants were against this and wanted longer leases.
In 2009, business leases at Cerculard Kee, which contributed about $2.5 million a year to the Obaid family, were extended without being presented for a public competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who had been the Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally been in favour of open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obaid, who, according to Mr. Tripodi, had strongly recommended changes in the Government's rent policy.
In the ICAC decryption of telephone conversations, talks were made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunne, a senior official who had come to the Port Ministry after working under the direction of Mr. Obaid in the fishery department.
“Was the matter discussed during these telephone conversations a matter of developing a commercial lease policy?” asked Assistant commissioner Anthony Wiley, Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was being discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to a high-level official, Israeli military aircraft are attacking targets inside Syria
A high-level administration official in an interview with Fox News confirmed that Israeli military aircraft had struck a target in the Syrian port town of Latakiy on Thursday night.
The official did not specify what the purpose was, but said at least one.
Associated Press reports that the target was rockets produced by Russian SA-125.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out air strikes on rocket cargo inside Syria.
External visa workers of Division 457 may be tested for “trueness”
The “validity” test for foreign visa workers of class 457 is under consideration by the Government, as it is intended to expand repressive measures.
This test, if accepted, will be applied to criteria designed to prevent the use of class 457 visa to fill unskilled jobs or as a loophole for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The paper submitted by the government for discussion was published today, while former labour member Maxine McCoy criticized the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying that it might offend Australia's neighbours.
"Bright statements like 'foreigners at the end of the queue' and'work for Australians at the beginning' are a very unpleasant setback to a time when trade union demands a secure labour market," she said to the Australian-Indian Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labor that needed to be protected -- and if some in the region had seen the reflections of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The document before the discussion outlined 12 measures which had previously been considered by the former Minister of Migration, Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he was meeting with officials on human trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the criteria of “validity” are accepted, the applicant may be examined to see whether “the applicant is a real applicant under conditions where the applicant is a relative or close familiar owner or a person associated with the financing of the business”.
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of visa holders in sub-class 457, since previously companies intending to sponsor a small number of employees were then employed by hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker died of an alleged heart attack upon arrival on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man ' s nine-year-old father, who had died in grief, had accompanied him on his way to Australia and had been supported by a cousin since his father ' s death on Wednesday, who had also been on board.
The Australian authorities rushed a man to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A friend of Semen Varlamov said that a hockey player had alcoholism
A friend of the hockey player Semen Varlamov, Yevgeny Vavrinyuk, said that he suffered from alcoholism, was passing the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said the woman in particular.
Remember that Vavrinyuk sued for beating a Russian golopper with Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado Club.
She said that the hockey player pulled her hair off and beat her hands, chest, abdomen and neck after the attack.
Varlamov himself went to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what had happened.
He was arrested, but later released on bail at $5,000.
The court did not restrict a sportsman from travelling around the country, but did not allow him to approach Vavrinyuk.
He also faces imprisonment of up to six years for domestic violence.
The British government announced a study to improve the economic impact on Scotland of the HS2 railway project.
Project HS2 involves opening a high-speed link to Scotland and North England, with the beginning of Phase I in 2026.
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, said that the project would “unit Britain.”
The Scottish Transport Minister, Keith Brown, said that he was "excited" about the prospects of working on the plan with the British government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When Phase Two is completed, the lines will be laid in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government resumed the estimated value of the high-speed line between London and North England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which is engaged in talks with Transport Scotland, has requested HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway bandwidth and reduced travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travelling from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our goal on HS2 is to create a truly national network that will make Britain and its cities closer to each other."
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it brings are huge.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But we're also talking about the transport of cities to each other; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better informed by HS2.
Scottish secretary Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called upon Mr. Carmichael to support “mutually” the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the general argument for the high-speed railway across Britain."
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, for the benefit of all and for the continuation of the Glasgow railway, Edinburgh, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British Ministers next year and taking a joint decision on the next steps.
Torius is a new hope for nuclear power?
Governments around the world are still thinking about how to meet their energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) has a negative effect on the climate.
Renewed energy sources require large areas for generation.
Nuclear power costs both but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste management.
Recently, scientists drew attention to thorium, another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It occurs all over the world, and experts say that its splintering does not leave waste that must be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Australian airfarers will need to continue switching off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite United States measures to ease the rules on these devices.
U.S. F.A.A. has allowed US transporters to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, provided they stay in Flight Mode.
While passengers can already do so during the main part of the flight, many are irritated that they do not have access to their electronic books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which requires US air companies to do a great deal of work to meet the new requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Air Safety Authority also indicated that they were considering the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight stages were still in place in Australia.
"The Civil Air Safety Authority does not currently have special rules for the use of electronic devices in aircraft," he said.
This matter is governed by regulations that require air carriers to maintain security at any time and that passengers to observe the safety rules that are reported to them by crew members.
Virgin, who had already discussed with the Civil Air Safety Authority the expansion of the use on board its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, did not mind the changes, but stated that it would follow the direction of the controller.
"We would welcome a consideration by the Civil Air Safety Authority of allowing the use of electronic devices, because we really think that this will improve the quality of client services now that it (the wireless entertainment system) is on our planes," said the press secretary.
Qantas stated that it would follow the rules currently in force.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we are not about to change them soon," she said.
The FAW Order applies to United States Airlines.
However, we are always interested in the regulatory changes that could benefit the passengers, and we will certainly carefully consider the decision of the FAW and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the effect of the order will vary from an air company to an air company and will depend on the age of their aircraft fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their planes are resistant to mobile devices as well as to revisions of manual, educational materials, hand-cuffing regulations and passenger instructions.
“After the company has verified and confirmed the immunity of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use hand-held, light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones at any height,” said the FAU.
In rare cases, the crew will instruct passengers to disable their devices during landing.
In addition, the group recommended that the heavier devices be placed under the seats or in the upper baggage compartments during takeoff and landing.
The head of the Duchess is heard in the anthem of Kubani's notes of extremistism
The football match between Angi and Kubanju had led to a political conflict between the Krasnodar Province and the Daguestan authorities after the fans had burned the flag of Daguesta, and the Cubani anthem had sounded differently.
The head of Daguestan, Ramazán Aboulatipov, on Thursday, invited the Republican Parliamentarians to go to court because the Anthem of the Krasnodar Province allegedly calls for ethnic strife, in particular, calls for a war against the Basurmans.
Take the Anthem of the Krasnodar Region, which is now approved in 1995.
It's a shame, and nobody's doing it.
"You are here remembering your mother, your enemy, and we're going to a mortal fight," "for such words to be recorded in an anthem, to poison some of the faithful with other faithful people," expressed his solidarity with the Aboulatype President of Parliament, Hisri Shihsaid.
Poetin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now, the news from the ocean, that is from Syria, where, as we have learned today, Israel struck rockets of Russian production which were reported to have been targeted by Hizbollah.
Syria has now met an important condition: to destroy its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement mediated by Russia, which enabled the US not to carry out a military operation that it was close to this summer.
More about weapons and what this means to the Syrian President, our main international correspondent, Richard Angel, will tell us.
Washington said that the Assad regime would be punished for that.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died of poison gas in August.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal that Assad's friend, Vladimir Poetin, had made.
Syria will abandon its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had decommissioned declared chemical weapons factories.
The longer-term and heavy task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that Assad's days were numbered.
I think Assad should go.
The question isn't whether it's going to happen, it's when it's going to happen.
He's no longer a legitimist and has to go.
But Assad stays.
And it feels even more confident.
His troops still use shelling, rockets and napalm.
His opponents are separated and ill-armed.
His people had to leave their homes, and many were hungry.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Al-Assad has escaped punishment for mass murder.
The chemical weapons agreement is described as a success of the diplomatic process, the inspectors have been sentenced to the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has made an impression of a person willing to work together.
Today, in Washington, the US ambassador to Syria has had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of hunger, it is hardly easier for his mother not to be killed with chemical weapons.
Assad's still holding up.
And he's changing his weapon to power.
The President of the Russian Federation set up a separate Ministry of Construction and FSC
Russian President Vladimir Poetin set up a new Ministry responsible for building and GKH and offered to lead it to the former governor of Ivanov oblast, Mikhail Menu, during his personal meeting.
The President met with Michael Menem at the Novo Ogarevo residence, and he did not refuse to head the new office.
The Russian President's Spokesman, Dmitry Pescove, explained that all construction and VCS functions were being transferred to a new ministry from the Minor region.
Mikhail Meng, the son of the famous Christian clergyman Alexander Me, graduated from the Moscow Gubkin Institute of Oil Chemistry.
His political career began in 1995, and he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergijevo-Posad region and was a member of the State Duma, the first Vice-Premier of the Moscow Region Government and Vice-Premier of the Moscow Government.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Meng was governor of Ivanov Oblast.
The owners of pawn shops in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties.
In a pawn shop at the Bendemir mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga lays a gold bracelet, ring, and earrings to pay for her daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is put there," said Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2400) a month as administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia, where household debt is growing, has become the third pawn shop registered on Singapore's stock exchange this week.
Loans on jewellery are not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Mrs. Amirthaling), but are almost as cheap as unsecured bank credits.
Generally, pawn shops in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4 percent offered at the United Overseas Bank branch, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawn shops have the advantage that they do not require credit testing or proof of wages and can lend faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people throughout the region turn to pawn shops because families feel pressure from rising costs of living and rapidly rising household and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and low-cost credit, fueled by free monetary policies in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families resort to pawn shops to offset the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, pointed to an increase in the family's credit shoulder, mainly due to an increase in the mortgage, as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt-to-gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia led the list with 80% of GDP, compared to 60% in 2008.
The economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from the technical crisis this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continued decline in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
“The fact is that with rising prices, people in the middle and bottom [the income scales] will look for ways to earn their income wherever they can,” says Song Seng Woon, economist CIMB, the Malaysian Bank.
High gold prices have increased the haste with which people lay their personal belongings over the past two years, as they take advantage of the opportunity to get money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the stock in 200 city-state pawn shops is gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's put in the grandmother's gold chain and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest pawn shop operator in AsiaMoney has seen an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months, up to 20 percent.
Growth in the pawn shop business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the office in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yeach Lee Ching, the Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week as a result of the stock exchange shares in Singapore.
While some lenders had caused criticism because of high interest rates, she said that the pawn shop not only offered cheaper fares than other lenders, it also did not increase debt directly.
"Clients are laying objects they already own, and monetaryization of personal assets does not increase household debt," she says.
The bid wins increased public recognition as a means of generating short-term, secured funding.
And it's not just those people who are in a difficult financial situation who use pawn shops.
Rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices by laying gold bars or Rolex watches, which can provide up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“They include wealthy persons who need to borrow short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties,” said Mrs. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, the quality of health care is not the number and status of health facilities available to the population, but rather the quality of health care.
The "Modernization of the health care of the Tulic Region" programme for the period 2011-2013, and the reconfiguration of our city's health institutions will make it possible to create an optimistic health-care structure for the population, including gynaecologically ill, pregnant and pregnant women.
Thus, after joining with the gourmet, it was even more possible to attract a narrow specialist from the GUZ "NICB" to consult pregnant women with various pathologies and to conduct additional hospital-based examinations.
Over the course of the upgrading programme, the facilities of the birth home have been significantly improved and modern equipment has been put in place to meet global standards.
Over the years, some 8 million roubles had been allocated for the major maintenance of the premises, and 112 items of equipment valued at 42 million roubles had been acquired.
The most modern equipment is the intensive post for babies.
In the operating room, the sal-saver machine is used to collect blood from an operating wound and, after special treatment, to return it to the baby, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment has also been provided with a laboratory diagnostic unit.
An electronic registrar is in operation at the women's clinics, and the introduction of electronic cards and patient stories is planned soon.
The development of telemedicine has made it possible to consult gynaecological patients, pregnant women, mothers and babies with district experts.
Chechens beat up and robbed 60 hookers in Strasbourg
Chechens have been arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on hookers.
The investigation has been under way since March this year.
Some 60 women complained to the Caucasians.
The bandits were reported to have ordered to a hotel in Strasbourg and then beaten and robbed them.
The gang's leader was a 27-year-old formerly convicted Chechen.
David Alab's defender of "Bavaria" became Austria's best sportsman in 2013, reporting the official Bondslygi website.
In this dispute, he had outpaced the winter sports that had become the best in the country.
The second was a skier named Marcel Hirscher, and the third was a ski jumper from a tremlin named Gregor Schirentsauer.
Last season, a 21-year-old Australian of Philippine-Nigerian origin helped his team win the League of Champions, the German Cup and the UEFA Super Bowl.
Arshavin's ex-wife rests with actor Andrey Chadov.
The former civil wife of the Peter's "Zenita" football player, Andrea Arshavin of Baranov, spends a vacation with actor Andrey Chadov.
Julia rests in Italy with an actress named Anastasia on the road, her fiance, Sergei Slanov, and an actor named Andrew Chadov.
Photos from the joint steam walk are published in Instagram Anastasia.
This isn't the first joint picture of Andrew and Julia.
On October 5th, the Roadway published a picture of a couple standing around the coast of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, the Xenita hovbec, Andrew Arshawin, confessed to living separately from his civil wife, Julia.
Remember, Julia Baranovskaya and Andrej Arshavin have been together since 2003, having three children.
Recently it was reported that Arshavin was dating an ex-model named Alice Casmine.
Arshavin's new friend was married to the corporate top manager.
A $325 million rescue package for health care in Tasmania
The Federal Government insists that a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's weakened health system will be accompanied by strict conditions that guarantee that the state government will not spend any money.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plybersek, announced that the Commonwealth was taking “emergency measures” to prevent a crisis caused by the aging population of this island State, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system limitations.
A four-year funding decision was made after consultation by the Government with independent Tasmanian deputy Andrew Wilke.
“The government has offered a package of emergency rescue measures that we believe will solve the particular problems faced by the state,” Mrs. Plybersek said today.
A $325 million package includes $31 million for a Blitz campaign on planned operations.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract removal operations, will help bridge the gap.
There is also money for unregistered clinics in Hobart and Lawrence, to improve the quality of post-patient care, to train health professionals, mental health services and to introduce personal electronic health cards systems in local hospitals.
“These investments will take place in advanced doctors' ideas on how best to help Tasmania's health system,” said Mrs. Plybersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania should work in a strict reporting and responsibility regime.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth funds and to report monthly on where it spends these additional funds.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides services as effectively and effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilke said today that $325 million would not solve anything “unless there is a real reform that will put Tasmanian health systems on a more sustainable basis”.
However, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will contribute significantly to bringing the state's health system out of critical condition,” said Mr. Wilke.
According to the state government, these additional sample procedures largely offset recent cuts.
But Peter Dutton, the Fed, believes that today's statement is a "leacoplasm-like solution."
"The reason why we're here is that the state's labor government puked $430 million out of the health system," he said to ABC TV.
When the state government takes nearly half a billion dollars away and the Commonwealth invests 300 million dollars, you can't pretend that's good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Mrs. Plybersec to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucratic costs.
Guillaume Nicklu's novel, Denis Diderot, can be shown by an extraordinary performance and historical details, but it is also more difficult to perceive than it should have been.
The film, which is taking place in France in the 1760s, tells the gloomy story of Susannah, a young aristocracy sent to the monastery by her family.
When she starts to rebel, she suffers extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadist lodger and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never falls to obscene or sensationality, and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, narratives risk becoming a test, like a pencil, for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons, says the observation group
Syria destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poisonous gas weapons, announced by an international observer group on Thursday, while violent clashes broke out in the north of the country, near one of the sites believed to contain poisonous substances.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
A declaration by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before the
The deadline of 1 November, set by this organization based in The Hague, for Damascus to destroy or “incapacitate” all means of producing chemical weapons and mechanisms to mix chemical substances with the production of poison gas and to fill them with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially an initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus's chemical weapons by mid 2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stocks.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and neural gas sarin.
This statement was made during the violent fighting on Thursday in Safira, where experts believe the chemical weapons production site and storage site are located, reports the British-based Syrian Centre for Human Rights.
A group of activists who tracked the losses through a network of activists in Syria stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of that number, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government side, the group stated that 29,954 persons were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-government combatants and 187 were Lebanese Hizbollah.
Also among those killed were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition combatants, many of whom were foreign.
According to a United Nations estimate of 25 July, 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops fought in Safir for weeks with rebels, many of whom are associated with Al-Qa'idah groups.
The Centre stated that there were casualties on Thursday from both sides, but did not provide specific data.
The fighting highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors in the midst of an ongoing civil war in the short time frame of their mission to rid Syria of the toxin.
The statement of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was “now satisfied that it had verified and seen destroyed all critical production and filling equipment declared by Syria”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe declared that both sites were declared by Syria as “disappeared and ... items of the chemical weapons programme contained in them were moved to other declared places which were verified”.
It was not possible to find out immediately whether the site in Safir was one of the two places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved next month by the Executive Committee of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in the most difficult mission this organization has ever undertaken,” said the Director-General of the observation group Ahmet Umümczew in a comment published by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
For the third year, civil war has brought up rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad government and its security forces, composed of members of its Alavite sect, the secession of Shia Islam.
With regard to other events, the head of the Rami Abdurrahman centre said that there had been a severe explosion on Wednesday at an air defence site in the Syrian coast of Lataki.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he said.
Worried by the verdict of the planners of the Bali bombing
The 202 survivors and relatives of the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted angryly to the sentence handed down to the last of the collaborators who had been tried and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who had spent nearly 10 years on the run, as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, had yesterday been sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment for his role in creating the explosive devices used during the attack.
He may be released within 15 years if he receives parole.
A 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, during which 202 people, including 88 Australians, died and dozens were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist-related charges, including the explosion of churches all over Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a person called a bomber for his reputation as a bomb master must be sentenced to death.
This decision compounded the painful memories of a mother from Perth June Cortin who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terror carried out by Patek and his accomplices almost ten years ago.
By holding back her tears, she said that Patek was to be sentenced to death.
"I really think he should follow the footsteps of the other guys.
He should appear in front of the shooting team,' said Mrs. Cortin AAP.
"I have to live every day knowing I won't have any grandchildren and I won't see my daughters."
The "Sari" club was destroyed when a massive explosive device, parked outside the van, was launched immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosive only 20 seconds earlier.
After that attack he fell into a coma for a month and died three times while being connected to the life support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of the three other members of the Jemaah Islamic terrorist cell responsible for the murder, namely Amrosi, Mukhasa and Imam Soluza, who had been executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most.
Keeping him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds, that's not much.
Patek is the last party to the Bali attack to be tried.
He had been in hiding for almost ten years, but he was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where American troops killed the former al-Qa'idah leader, Usama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an F.B.I. agent showed that intelligence data showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qa'idah.
"He hasn't given up," said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he had not been sorry for the grief he had caused others.
The verdict is in the run-up to the tenth anniversary of the attack, which will take place later this year in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Cortin.
Patek may still appeal his sentence.
FAU: "Air passenger can now use aircraft gadgets (but not call from a mobile phone)"
Airfarers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to speak on their mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published on Thursday by the Fed.
But passengers shouldn't expect changes to happen immediately.
As soon as this change occurs, it will vary depending on the company, said the Fau administrator Michael Wirt at a press conference.
Air companies will have to show FAUs how their planes meet the new guidelines and that they update their flight crew training and installation rules to meet the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some air companies to increase the use of hand-held electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the companies that had already submitted plans.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon," said the FAU.
Currently, passengers are obliged to shut down their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane door closes.
They mustn't restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain says "good."
The passengers must shut down their devices again when the plane is down for landing and do not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, FAW stated that aircraft whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and driving.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft, modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Flying Association, welcomed these changes.
“When the new policy is successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to do so), it will be a win-win option,” said Glading.
We're quite tired of feeling "teacher-by-school" when it comes to this.
But Internet connections for surfing, exchange of emails, text messages or downloading of data will still be prohibited at a height of less than 10,000 feet, reported the agency.
The passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to flight mode.
So there's still no "Words with Friends" -- an intellectual online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when an insidious incident occurred: the actor was taken off the American Airlines for refusing to shut down the device while the plane was on its way to landing.
And the heavier devices, like laptops, will still have to be put into the luggage room, because they can hurt somebody if they fly all over the cabin.
Cell phone calls in flight will also continue to be prohibited.
The administrative authority for telephone calls is vested in the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU.
FAU may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Security Council, a national transport safety expert from CBS News, said that cell phones were still considered a risk.
"Home phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigational devices, but we know from the FCC that they can interfere with cellular towers when the plane is in the air," said Rosenker.
The industry advisory committee set up by the FAU to study this issue recommended last month that the Government allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on FAHU to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri's Senator-Democrat, Clare McCaskill, claim that there are no valid security reasons for bans.
The implementation of restrictions is also becoming more difficult, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore instructions to disable their devices.
The FAH began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by FAUs as resistant to electronic interference.
Air companies have been offering passengers a cruise-high Wi-Fi for several years.
Engines modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of ships are designed to use electronic devices more widely in accordance with the new guidelines, said Weert.
Today's electronic devices usually emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, e-mail only minimal messages when scrolling pages.
But the signals become stronger when the devices load or send data.
One of those who sought to reduce restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company downloaded a whole aircraft with its electronic book readers and flew on it to test problems but never found them.
The members of the FAU advisory committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices represented any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airpassers stated that he considered interference with the devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only individual pilot reports confirming that devices might interfere with air systems, most of which were very old.
However, the committee recommended that FAU allow pilots to require passengers to disable their devices during landings under conditions of limited visibility.
A group of tourists welcomed these changes, describing them as a sane step to meet the passengers who are now using a lot of technology.
“We are glad that the FAU recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with security and protection,” said Roger Doe, Director General of the US Tourist Association.
Schools will be able to conduct driving exams
A driver's license exam will be accepted by private companies with their own computer-based motorway.
This is the subject of a comment by the Committee referring to a draft government decree on "Acceptance to driving".
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such motorways in Russia.
It is assumed that students of such "privileged" car schools will be counted on the results of internal testing.
In doing so, the State Audit Office will monitor the completion of examinations every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30 percent of the theoretical exams and more than 20 percent of the playgrounds do not take place on the first occasion, the school will be denied privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for motorways contained in the draft government decree have been in force since 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for two-wheeled driving.
From 1 January 2015, motorcyclists will be required to take an urban driving examination to obtain category A licenses.
In addition, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights since 5 May 2014.
Such employees would be required to obtain Russian rights after the examination.
A bird transported by air to a secure place from a drilling rig in the North Sea, released back to the wild
A bird thrown over the air to shore after being found in an exhausting state on an oil tower in the North Sea was released back to the wild.
This water paste was placed on a helicopter heading to Aubergine last month and was then released by the Scottish Animals Protection Society (SPCA) in the rescue centre in Alla.
The manager of the Center, Colleen Seddon, said, "This water pasture is probably a winter migration from Northern Europe, which has hit the zone of strong winds over the North Sea."
The bird seems to have lost its strength and was able to find shelter at the oil tower.
He added, "She was unable to take off again, so we were asked for help."
The water caregiver was healthy and well by the time he was released.
Is Europe's elite ready to run a business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with an obligation to gather business representatives and to determine what changes the UK's wealth and jobs would like to see in its relations with the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about Britain, business, and the EU.
YouTube interviewed over 1,000 business leaders representing a large business in Britain in size, sectors and regions.
The findings of the poll will be a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are currently searching for export opportunities outside Europe, with special attention to countries that are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India, and Brazil, rather than wasting time on a long and difficult process of reforming the complicated institutions of the EU.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from competition to product laws, most business leaders felt that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general discontent with the single market, with business representatives arguing that the costs of regulating from Brussels now exceeded the benefits of being in the European trade zone, with even 40 percent of the large businesses that have traditionally been the most pro-European companies.
Last and foremost, our survey of business leaders has shown that the obvious majority wants the United Kingdom to pursue a policy-oriented and trade-based approach to the EU.
This result, which has been observed among companies of all sizes and major business groups, suggests that business insists on a “imaginable change” that will restore power back to Britain.
The stakes are high: reaching changes in the contract and more favourable conditions for the UK will result in a 16 percent shift in the vote to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt about this: this poll shows that the British business supports his plan to renegotiate British EU membership.
It also shows that business expected that the revision would result in a significant shift in the current balance of power back to Britain.
The best conditions for British business are possible and are becoming more necessary as the eurozone embarks on the path of closer economic and financial integration.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and as our survey shows, for business this means a greater focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels's regulations.
U.S. Special Services are listening to the pope's personal phone.
The Vatican is under the watchful control of United States intelligence services.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection show that U.S. intelligence was listening to all the talks of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now closely protecting Pope Francis.
His phone began to be bugged before he became head of the Vatican.
The new pope's election process was also monitored.
What was of particular importance in the US.
The intelligence service has reached out to the cardinal's cell phones, who have gathered in Rome to select the next Pope.
The telephones of the settlement where the Conclaves lived were also heard.
American spies were listening to all the main candidates for the Pope's throne to prevent the appearance of a figure that Washington did not want.
Panorama magazine reports that the "greater ear of the United States" continued to intercept the conversations of the prelate until the end of the conclave on March 12.
It is alleged that the Argentine archbishop Bergolio has been named as the future Pope of Rome in the United States since 2005.
The US intelligence was also engaged in talks related to the election of the new President of the Vatican Bank.
An Italian magazine reports that a secret group of ClA and U.S.A. agents continue to work at the US Embassadorial in order to extract information about politicians and financial flows.
The Vatican, in turn, peacefully declared that it did not care about the American wire, even if it was happening.
From the US leadership, holy fathers have no secrets.
A snowboarder for the olympic bills was specially photographed
The Bank of Russia issued a memorable note on Wednesday to the city of Sochi, where the Games will take place this winter.
The nominal bills are 100 rubles.
But on the web bloggers are already actively ironic about the memorable banknote.
After a presentation on October 30, they noticed that an image of a snowboarder from a note could be found in photos.
In particular, in the free vault of a photograph of StockExchange, where this photograph is dated 2005.
The same photograph is used in the Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website "Megoscope" on January 18, 2011.
It was also used in RugGear's smartphone advertisements.
The olympian note was made in blue and blue gum.
On the one hand, there's a snowboarder flying over Sochi, and on the other is a kind of olympics stadium and a hot bird.
The author of the design of the note was Paul Bushuev, who won a competition among students at the Repin Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg.
At the presentation, it was reported that there were a number of sports, i.e. ski, fristille, and jumping from a tamplin, but that they eventually chose a snowboard because it was a relatively young sport.
According to the source of the news, close to the BC, the controller does not care about the public opinion about the widespread distribution of the image of an olympian snowboarder and is currently studying the situation.
But the State is not too concerned about the noise around the olympian banknote.
The Head of the Press Service of State, Natalia Niquiforov, said to "the news" that all the reasoning about plagiarism is funny.
The snowboarder on the note is turned to the right, and the photos on the network are to the left, and she explained to Nickiforov.
The person in the photo shoot to create the bill was shot from different angles, then the final image was selected, and it was a typical snowboarder posture.
It also pointed out that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympian banknote because the artist had been paid for work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill is quite positive.
The recognition of the image on the bill -- plus the promotion of it -- is considered by the Executive Director of the PNP, Rus Brand, by Alexei Popovichev.
It is difficult to prove the 100 percent resemblance of images on the bill and in photographic banks, so it is unlikely that intellectual property claims will take place.
It was the first time that an olympics note appeared in China, with a 10 yuan commemorative note for the 2008 Beijing Games.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
The legal bans made Russians drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
They assume that the consumption of beer in the country next year will remain at the same level, and that's at best.
Though the businessmen originally expected to grow.
Because this year is bad for them, sales have fallen by 7 percent.
This was reported by the head of one of the country's largest brewery companies, the President of the Russian Brewers Union, Isaac Shepps, at the third annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute, "The goods of daily demand in Russia," which just ended in Moscow.
It discussed public market regulations.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market had already declined by 18 percent, as there had been a significant increase in the regulation of the brewery industry in recent years in terms of the production and trade of beer, a low-alcohol drink, reported to the audience by Shepps.
No country in the world has such a severe limitation on the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of new and new illogical bans, which are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The beer-warr observed that many legal bans to reduce alcohol abuse had little impact, but more and more initiatives were constantly taking place.
Beer production has been hit most severely by the ban on selling liquor in kiosks since this year.
"We lost 35,000 consumers immediately," said Isaac Shepps.
Next year the brewers have two projections.
Optimistic is what Shepps was talking about: selling foam drinks will stay at the same level.
Pessimistic, it'll fall by another 2 to 3 percent.
To save their profits, businessmen are forced to move from mass-consumer varieties to the "premium" class: beer will be smaller, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
"I've observed that the rate of alcohol abuse is about the same," said Dr. Alexey Cellar.
True, the percentage of sick people who use strong drink surrogates has increased, as well as those who have been addicted to alcohol-containing tonicative beverages such as the Jaguar, while 10 years ago alcoholism was the mainstay.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford Auto Factory in Vladvodhodsk.
As the trade union says, all those dismissed have received compensation.
However, the issue of reducing productivity in the region is much more acute than that of workers.
A deputy of the Regional Zacks, Alexei Etmanov, said at the meeting that about 600 people had been cut off at the Ford factory in Vzvodovska.
He said that this had happened as early as September: at the time, about 600 people had withdrawn from the factory under a programme of voluntary dismissal which had been developed with the organization's trade union.
A “golden parachute” of several wages was offered to workers who decided to quit voluntarily.
As a result, the vast majority left their jobs voluntarily.
However, according to Etmanov, that number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's what this is about.
However, in the next two years, the authorities did not plan to adopt any support programs for the region's hard-run companies,” he explained, adding that the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction in jobs.
In Ford, this information is not denied or confirmed.
We're waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as he shows up, we'll publish it.
Talking about a reduction of workers at the Ford factory in the universe has been going on for a long time.
For example, the company's plans to fire 600 people came to light in September.
The plant had previously declared a halt in the production of cars.
The reason in the factory was the fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrstat, the result of nine months in 2013 was a 5.4 per cent decrease in industrial production in Lenoblast.
Transport and equipment production decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobiles can be used during the take-off and landing of an aircraft
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during the take-off and landing of the aircraft have been approved in the United States, and BBC Telecorp reports.
US air companies are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, and the new rules will be in effect by the end of 2013.
However, Internet connections to receive and send e-mails will not be allowed during flight at a height of less than 3 km.
Because of the risk of interference with the aircraft ' s radio equipment, cellular voice will still be restricted.
Flight passengers will thus be allowed to read electronic books, play games on tablets and other gadgets and watch videos during internal and international flights.
Airlines will be required to check the safety of electronic devices during the flight before the rules are adopted.
Airlines will also have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Air Administration that they will be able to cope with the perceived impact of mobile aircraft and aircraft controls.
According to the source, for example the US, it is also possible to re-evaluate the current standards for the use of electronic devices in flight in Britain.
The "Russian Mafia" in the United States has finally established a new name called the "Bruther Circle."
This week, the blacklist of the Russian Mafia in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Department of Finance has introduced three Russians, two Uzbeks and an Israeli into the Brotherhood.
One of the Russians turned out to be a famous singer, Gregory Leps, who is suspected of transporting money to members of the group.
In total, the United States blacklist contains 22 members of the Brotherhood and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts doubt that such an organization actually exists.
"The "Brother Circle" statement is more like an attempt to merge scattered criminal groups," said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime and professor at the University of New York.
In his view, the "Broth Circle" reflects a popular perception of the Russian Mafia.
"I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who has confirmed the existence of such a criminal organization," quotes Mr. Galeotti from the United States Centre for the Study of Corrupt and Organised Crime.
Professor Liz Shelley of George Mason University also agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
"If they work together, it's more like a criminal network, but not an organization," she quotes the Centre for the Study of corruption and organized crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the "Bruder's Circle" combines a more close Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoian, known as Grandpa Hasan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
For example, the activities of Lashi Shoshanashvili and Zechariah Kalashov, who had completed the list in 2012, were closely linked to Grandpa Hasan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was the nephew of Grandpa Hasan.
However, he pointed out that some individuals were not related to Usoian.
In his view, they were all more united by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal about the inclusion of Gregory Leps in the Brotherhood, the beloved singer of Russian President Vladimir Poetin, attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect more detailed information from our American partner colleagues, which led to a decision on why it was placed on such lists, said the Spokesman of the Head of State, Dmitry Sandov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
The head of Gazprom Alexei Miller says that the Bulgarian pipeline marks a new era in the gas field
The launch of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launching of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the head of Gazprom.
"Today a landmark event occurred: the construction of a Bulgarian section of the Southern Flow pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, began," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
The South Stream is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The dispute between Gazprom and his partners in Ukraine, where most of Russia's European gas is located, increases the risk for normal routes, says officials.
Miller said that the direct link with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geo-politic risks associated with countries in transition had been addressed “for all time”.
Bulgarian consumers will get gas from the Southern Flow at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts to work in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should start in other countries along the pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 Billion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning, in the Sarat district, the driver of the Peugeot car drove off to a crossroads about 115 km of Odessa-Renee and ran into a bus containing six people.
This is reported by the GSS Press Service in Odessa.
A 31-year-old driver of the Peugeot car died in the incident.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old driver of a bus who had a leg jammed down.
The doctor gave the woman the first medical care on the ground, and she refused to be hospitalized.
Emergency medical officers also examined all other passengers.
The rescuers pulled up the bus with a crane and released the driver of the bus, whose foot was locked at the bus door.

Two YMCA officers were accused of sexual crimes even before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission found out.
Two YMCA NSW officers were charged with sexual crimes against children before charges were brought against a child care worker in Karingbach by Jonathan Lord, who reported to the Royal Commission on Child sexual abuse.
But the commission's introductory statement stated that it had “never been involved in cases of sexual violence against children within its organization”.
The Chief Executive Director of Philip Hayer was asked about one case in which an YMCA employee was accused of child pornography crimes and another case in which a YMCA Caringbah Hall teacher was convicted of sexual crimes against children under his care in 1991.
Mr. Hair told Gail Ferness, the lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He admitted that YMCA, in its opening speech to the commission, had also made an inaccuracies, arguing that "there were external YMCA tests that recognized YMCA as being in the front row of the children's safety."
The evidence submitted to the commission suggests that YMCA was notified that it received the second of four possible quality ratings from the Department of Education and Communities last August.
Mr. Hair, who joined YMCA when he was 21 years old, acknowledged that he and the lower management had failed by employing the Lord and had failed to ensure a clear understanding by the staff of their obligation to report child security abuses.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of sexual crimes against 12 boys during his two years at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hair rejected the assumption that the corporate ethic of YMCA prevented staff from reporting Lord's abuses in the area of children's security.
The officers stated that they had observed abuses, including that the Lord had been alone with the children, personally looked after them, put them on his lap, said that he liked one of them and allowed them to play with their mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the Lord's leadership and asked to be trained to protect her children because she was concerned about his behaviour, showed that she had found Jacky Barnath, the YMCA child care manager in Karingbach, who was the Lord's leader, "very frightening and often difficult to access."
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the staff's explanation that it was awkward for them to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said that their friendship with the Lord prevented them from thinking about the need to report him.
Mr. Hair said that he had presented his opinion to the New South Wales YMCA Board that the lesson for an organization from the Jonathan Lord incident was not "relating to the provision of information" by the staff and the Board accepted it.
Mr. Hair stated that the decision to force staff to sign confidential arrangements shortly after the charges were brought was made by the YMCA Director of Child Care, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was intended to prevent the evidence from being corrupted, but it was “exceeded” and the decision was not implemented properly.
YMCA New South Wales was not a safe organization for children during Jonathan Lord's work during the period 2009–2011; it was reported to the commission by Professor Stephen Smallbone of the University of Gryffin.
He said that there were "serious problems" in the selection, selection, coaching, training and monitoring of staff.
The hearing is adjourned until December 20.
It's a fashion week in São Paulo.
She's considered to be a real star in her hometown, not just a model.
Despite the fact that Giselle Bündchen had for a while left the job, distracted herself on the motherhood, she had come this week and this week in a defiance.
Her absence for months did not prevent her from keeping her seat on the runway and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the world's highest paid supermodel.
This time she was part of the Colcci Defile.
The end of a fashion week is usually the most interesting show.
It's sort of something that Leno Villaventure's stylist has arranged.
Marke has been active in the theatre and in the film industry for over 30 years, in parallel with the production of the luxury pret-a-port, and in the design of costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, over 30,000 companies and companies that are relevant to the textile industry and the fashion world took part in the end-of-the-week São Paulo fashion week.

Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as British Prime Minister, but admits that return is unlikely.
On the night before that, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his departure, a 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his retirement in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussion of British politics, restricting most of his comments to foreign affairs and to his role as a ambassador to the four Middle East peacekeepers.
In response to a question as to whether he would return to the position of Prime Minister, Blair said, according to the London Evening Standard, "Yes, of course, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so... "
"Milana's chief coach Massimiliano Allegree expressed his regret for the score in the 10th Tour of the Italian championship with the Latio.

The team played a good match, creating 3 to 4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn't let Latio do anything.
The second Romans were added, but in general I can't say that we've lost our concentration.
You had to win.

Look at Kake, who had a high-level meeting.
The experts who were moving to Cardiff to fight for the Winter Prize knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the appearance of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy who had just made his first move a few months earlier, this little boy and his child, Shetland's pony Toffie, ran through three rounds to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult opponents far behind.
This inseparable pair, the same height, received high scores for its appearance, behaviour and style at an annual competition run by the Sunnybenk horse sports centre in Radry, near Cardiff.
After taking a general look at the men and women in beautiful hat-cats, he pushed his hat aside and carried proudly around the circle of two-year-old Toffee.
The judges lauded Fenton for his developed congenital ability to handle horses for years and years.
And Toffee got the highest score for appearance and character.
Fenton was given to Toffee on his third birthday last March, and he's been studying with a Shetland pony every day ever since.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffee form a beautiful duo."
They had a lot of opponents, but these two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second performance with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Completely strangers in the Arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture of it.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abb-Wale in South Wales, is following the footsteps of his aunt, Aaron Howells, who has been throwing horses for over 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said, "The whole audience was astonished, and everybody shouted approval and clapped."
He ran through the sand all over the Arena and, although it looked so tiny, did a fine job.
Fenton is crazy about animals -- he likes horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
From the way he began, he will soon be participating in the Loss of the Year, and I am sure he will be doing well.
The representative of this annual horse exhibition said, "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The judges commended Fenton and Toffee for their appearance and for the way they introduced themselves to the show ring.
They rate the consonance of the pony and the factory -- Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure that Fenton was helped by his handsome dress, and he was really good at his part.
A Chinese newspaper called "to be reorganized"
The Chinese newspaper, which published on the front page a call for the release of the accused in the slander of a reporter, must be reorganized, reports the press controller.
Guangzhou newspaper The New Expression made an unexpected public announcement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yunzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with public ownership.
Now, the New Expression has to go through the "complete fixing process," as the controller reports.
The order for "correction of errors" came from the Guangdong Authority in the field of press and publications, radio, film and television.
A pre-trial investigation found that a newspaper belonging to Young Evening News Group published a series of false stories about Zoomlio's listed company between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The "New Expression" manual was disoriented," said the manager.
He reports that a decision has been made to “delegate an administrative penalty to Chen Yunzhou in the form of a revocation of his reporter's license”.
He also ordered Young Evening News Group to make a complete correction of the errors in the "New Expression" and recommended that it investigate the situation-related newspapers and immediately change the management of the "New Expression".
Mr. Chen had written several articles for the "New Expression" in which he had reported financial abuses in a construction company called Zoomlio.
After he was arrested, his newspaper published on the front page two calls for his release, claiming that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on public television, admitting that he had published false articles for money.
"In this case, I caused damage to Zoomlio, as well as to the entire news industry and its ability to earn public confidence," he said to the state-owned broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my guilt.
Following Mr. Chen's confession, the New Expression published an apology on the front page, saying that the newspaper had failed to properly verify his reports.
Recently, several high-level suspects made confessions on television.
The experts say that the practice of extracting confessions in China continues to be widespread, despite recent changes to the laws that prevent the authorities from coercing someone into self-incriminating.
A U.S. tunnel was discovered — Mexico for the transport of drugs, equipped with its own railway
Found one of the most sophisticated drug-smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico, with their own lighting, venting and electric rail systems.
The U.S. government described this tunnel as one of the most difficult secret passages ever discovered.
This tunnel, whose zigzags are nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
The area is filled with invisible warehouses, which makes it easier to load drugs in a truck.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were smuggled through, as reported by the authorities.
According to court documents, law enforcers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine upon detection of the tunnel.
Three men who, according to the law enforcers, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they would be sentenced to 10 years ' to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drains.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after a marijuana harvest in October, which made it difficult for drug cartels to quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards, fitted with rail routes, from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
In Belarus, pensions have increased since November
In Belarus, pensions have been rising since November of this year and have been reported to BELTA's correspondent at the General Department of Pensions of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
As from 1 November this year, the average wage of employees in the Republic, which was applied to the previous recalculation of pensions, will be adjusted by 5.4 per cent, and the corresponding recalculation of the employment pension will be carried out in accordance with decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on the increase of pensions.
As a result of the recalculation since November, work-age pensions are estimated to increase by an average of 5.3%.
The average age pension will be Br2 million 295,000.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million inhabitants of the Republic.
The cost of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus for the payment of increased pensions will increase by Br274.3 billion per month from November this year.
Simultaneously with the recalculation of the employment pension in November this year, minimum and social pensions, supplements, increases and supplements will be recalculated as a result of an increase in the per capita minimum wage.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 million,530, an increase of 2.1 per cent over the period from 1 August to 31 October.
As a result, the minimum working pensions, social pensions and supplements, increases and supplements will be increased by 2.1 per cent from 1 November.

The British police give Assange a notification of surrender
The British police today notified the founder of WikiLeaks to Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that they had given a 40-year-old Australian “an official surrender request” to appear at the police station, adding that if this requirement was not met, he would be subject to further arrest.
Assange is threatened with expulsion to Sweden on charges of sexual crimes after he has exhausted his options under British law, when the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal for expulsion earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand it over to the United States, he took refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassade in London on 19 June, asking this South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “trust a 40-year-old man with a formal requirement to surrender, which requires him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice,” reported the Spokesman.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The mission refused to comment on the police notification.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible charges of spying following the publication of over 250,000 U.S. diplomatic papers on the anti-secretity WikiLeaks website.
Driver driving at a speed of 130 miles an hour with a hot drink between his legs fined £1000
The car driver was fined £1000 for driving up to 130 miles an hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old, from Tipptree, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A-120 highway in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to take between his legs.
In the Court of the Peace of Kolchester Howie, he admitted the charge of driving without due diligence or consideration.
The addition of seven penalty points to his driving licence led to a six-month driving ban.
Howe was also obliged to pay £90 and an additional fee of £100 to help crime victims.
A tax on foreign property owners will cause the London bubble to burst
The Treasurer had made a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax, but was awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who had introduced in the 2012 budget a 7 per cent government fee for houses valued at more than £2 million and an annual payment for customers who decided to own houses in a company rather than as individuals.
So far, the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsi estate government, which was 708 million pounds in financial year 2012 - 2012 is already exceeding the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and Humberou combined.
Mr. Cooke said: "With an increase in government debt on expensive houses and associated anti-evasion legislation, it is very difficult to argue that taxing on expensive properties is understated, regardless of the influence of an outdated municipal tax system."
"But this might cause some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy real estate in London or the current owners would not want to sell it," he added.
The value of first-class real estate, which is the top 5-10% of the market value, rose by 11.8% over the past year in the rich Southwest London belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to grow steadily at an annual rate of 5.6 per cent, but were overshadowed by a rapidly developing “national market” with a spike in prices in the south-west, the north (7.4 per cent) and the east (6.5 per cent) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on the way the dog's tail moves relate to its mood.
Earlier studies showed that satisfied dogs hung their tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), while alarmed dogs wave their tail mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can notice and react to these delicate differences in tailing.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, says: "It is well known that people on the left and right sides of the brain have different roles in forming agents that generate positive or negative emotions."
Here we've tried to look at this from other species.
He added that, as with humans, the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotion.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the multiple tailings of other dogs, researchers observed animals watching movies about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of the animal's heartbeat and analyzed their behavior.
We'll probably soon find out why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes the other.
Professor Wallortigara said, "We showed dogs videos of dogs, either naturalistic versions or silhouette, to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more to the left or to the right."
When animals saw that the rest of the unspeakable dog moved his tail to the right (from the point of view of his tail), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was leaning mainly left (remaining from the point of view of the tailing dog), their heart rate increased and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience which movements they should worry about and which they should not.
He notes: "If there are several encounters with other dogs and often their tails thrown in the same direction are linked to more friendly behaviour and the right side gives less friendly behaviour, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience."
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
An expert in dog behavior, John Bradshaw, an invited researcher at the University of Bristol Veterinary School, said that this was not the first study to test whether dogs mattered to the left and right.
Last year a group of researchers at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turn their heads left if they look at an aggressive dog and right when they look at a satisfied dog.
And at another University of Victoria University in Canada, he reported: "The dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when his tail was pointing to the left rather than to the right rather than to become alarmed, the contrary to the Italian study."
He said that the difference could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs might be useful, he explained.
" While there is enough evidence for various mammals that the two brain hemispheres are being used for different purposes, many details have yet to be clarified, and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour may be recorded, it is likely that we will soon understand why their tails are sometimes directed in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys is postponing a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's illness.
Rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed the concert in Glasgow after her singer had been diagnosed with laryngitis.
This chieffield band was scheduled to perform at the Hydro City Concert on Friday.
However, Alex Turner's singer's disease made them move the show.
The group's statement was made after it had to also defer the concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys reported: "After the decision to move the show to the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical attention from the Arctic Monkeys, the show should also be postponed to the Hydro site in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November."
"Alex Turner was diagnosed with laryngith and unfortunately unable to speak."
The LG Arena show in Birmingham will now take place on November 20th, and the Glasgow show will take place on November 21st.
All tickets to this show remain valid.
We want to apologize to all the ticket owners for any inconvenience that this caused them.

Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will re-establish new Catholic Church cardinals for the first time in his service on February 22, as the Vatican declared on Thursday.
The Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who elect the popes, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually be involved in choosing his successor.
There are now 201 Cardinals.
However, after the cardinal had reached the age of 80, he could no longer take part in the pope's elections, which was the responsibility of a group of 120 “Kardinals” voters.
In announcing this news, the Vatican press secretary, Father Federico Lombardi, said that a meeting of all the present cardinals, known as the Consistory, would be held before the Sanctuary.
"Papa Francis decided to announce his decision to call a consistory in February in order to make it easier to schedule other meetings with cardinals from around the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February the number of cardinal voters was likely to decrease.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as it takes to re-establish the number of cardinals who are elected to 120, as well as the number of cardinals who are over 80 years of age as he wants.
The consistory next year will be of great importance because it will be the first since Francis was elected last March, according to Valero.
So far, there is some sort of bias in favour of Europe and especially for Italy.
"It would be interesting to see if the new Pope would appoint cardinals from other parts of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a trivial number of cardinals.
It will also be the first chosen cardinals since the establishment by Francis of the Cardinal Council, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who has been called upon to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad made his own decisions.
"Now Francis has selected eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said that it was “fully possible” that Francis would turn to the Cardinals for advice.
But we haven't been in this situation before -- this is all for the first time.
Valero said that the popes usually appointed a cardinal bishop from the great parishes, but Francis "is full of surprises, so we don't know who he's going to call."
GM cancels a series of new pickup pickups in the United States to improve seat backs
General Motors Co has revoked nearly 19,000 completely new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra of the 2014 model to address manual seat back adjustment problems, in accordance with a Friday's notice from the U.S. Automobile Security Authority.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the back tilting mechanism.
As a result, the seat backs do not meet the federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"In the case of a rear impact, the head restraint may not properly protect the occupants by increasing the risk of an injury," states a notification on the website of the National Road Safety Administration.
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The GM pickup was launched in June and is the most important serial car launch for the leading American car manufacturer since its reconfiguration due to the 2009 bankruptcy.
The GM informed the pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration could not consider notifying the owners of the 16-day government shutdown, which reduced the rate of car sales in October.
Silverado and Sierra pickups, which had been upgraded for a model series in 2014, rose by about 20 percent during the first 10 months of the year, as GM announced on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
The GM stock on the New York Stock Exchange grew by 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
The cry of despair by Obama's voters
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope for possible change.
He says that Obama has allowed the Republicans to be obstructed by laudable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify problems with the Obama-reformed health system web site, UAV attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what might be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student of the University of Harvard's Second School of Medicine.
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
I thought this book would cheer me up in a time of discouragement in my second year of medical science and restore a sense of hope in me.
It's called The Vigority for Victory, and it's a memoir about Barack Obama's 2008 Presidential campaign.
When I finish my patients' reports at night and go to bed, this book returns me at a time when politics has inspired millions of people, and performances have been exciting.
The victory in the elections was remarkable, and leading news programs paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates wept for joy, and my parents kept every newspaper they could find.
A young team of strategists was to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
At the time of Obama's assumption of office in 2008, the level of support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Return to the present is a rude awakening, like extracting from a dream.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Over the years since I dropped my first ballot, changes have indeed occurred.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and various achievements, from the adoption of a law on accessible medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the lifting of the "Don't ask, don't talk" rule to the murder of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstruction has blocked too many attempts to advance our country: immigration reform, public health choices and the closing of the Guantánamo base among others.
But after countless times I've stood by the Obama administration, defending it in front of colleagues and peers, I've had no more explanations that I can provide.
I've reached a point of political despair.
Republican Obstruction cannot explain the authorization to intercept foreign leaders or to attack innocent children in other countries by drones.
He could not explain the collection of data on American privacy by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of whistle-blowers revealing government abuses.
He could not explain the murder of an American citizen, Anwar Al-Awlaki, without trial or investigation, or the failure to meet government funding and spending limits during the Presidential campaign.
He cannot justify the report, which states that the efforts made by the White House to silence the media are “the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration”.
It has recently failed to justify the failure to develop a simple web site for more than three years after the signing of the Accessible Medical Care Act.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I, at the age of 18, realize that leadership may contradict the political campaigns that precede it?
Evidently, working for an elected office is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be shaped by an opposition political party and by such random events as the murder in Newtown.
However, all of the examples I have listed above show that they were to a large extent their own choice of administration.
And that's what worries me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, and seemed unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I assumed that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, would meet the hopes we had heard for so long.
However, when Obama's rating dropped below 45% this week, it became much more difficult to return to 2008 with this book.
It makes me miss many promises that have disappeared.
This week I read that part of the book describing how Clinton had struck Obama with a stunning defeat in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting to analyse the reasons for failure, he told his staff that they must return to normal and remain faithful to their goal.
"I want us to get our appeal back," he said.
We must remember who we are."
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I agree perfectly with you.
The views expressed in this comment belong exclusively to Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that member Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in child care leave.
MP Milliardaire Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in child care leave because his daughter may become pregnant and benefit from it.
This quarry, which has an unfinished carbon tax dispute of $6 million, made this statement at a time when it was trying to discard the question of whether or not it had a conflict.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the senate, which may be decisive in the decision to cancel taxes on carbon emissions and mining.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only Ministers could have a conflict of interest, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from political action.
"He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid childcare leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they get paid leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the elections, the Election Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer to be the winner in the struggle for a seat from the Sunshine-Kost Fairfax district, with a vote of 53 votes after the recalculation of the vote.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the vote counting process in order to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget.
Should the decision on these elections be taken two months after we voted?
"We need to have a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system so that we can come in, put our data on the computer, vote immediately, and get the result at 6:30 that same evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the sheets.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
The use of pencil seems strange these days.
The Election Commission was examining the possibility of electronic voting and had recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59 years old, said that his programme included an international airport for Sunshine Cost and would take his new work very seriously.
Public office means public service.
"We do not seek any reward except to thank history for being able to serve this district at a critical moment," he said.
RBS suspends two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily suspended two traders in its Exchange Division, according to two people familiar with this situation, which is further evidence that global checks by the governors of perceived monetary manipulation are rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with the world's largest financial market, with a daily rate of $5.3 billion.
These two traders will be the first members of the RBS to be suspended during an unfolding investigation, which is associated with a scandal associated with the manipulation of the LIBOR inter-bank bet.
By refusing to comment on the removal, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from the authorities this month.
“Our current investigation of this matter is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and our other administrators,” the bank reported two weeks ago.
Last month, informed persons said that RBS had handed over the email and instant messages received and sent to his former trader, the British Authority, the Financial Performance Control Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left the RBS in 2010 and is known to have been given leave in his current position as head of European spot trade in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of the European spot trade in Citi, left this week while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by the Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any abuses.
Mr. Asher's contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed persons.
The UBS bank reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss administrator Finma said that it was investigating alleged monetary manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six of the world's regulators — the European Commission, Finland, Switzerland's competition authority, Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Currency Authority — are considering claims that bankers have conspired to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began internal checks or received requests for information from the authorities, told a person familiar with the situation.
Banks have been searching for instant messages and e-mails over a few years in the search for abuses.
The verification news has led to the emergence of trade traders in recent years as one of the largest sources of revenue from investment banking trades, which this year, however, has encountered difficulties due to the fact that low currency volatility has reduced opportunities for purchasers.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by saying that the vast and highly liquid monetary market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trade in the currency market, the fragmenting of liquidity between different trade platforms and the wider use by banks of their internal platforms means that “you can begin to influence the market at a very low price”.
This news came on the same day that the Credit Suisse bank announced that it had fired one of the traders in its London Stock Exchange stock trade this week after it had caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and worked with its administrators.
"We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the issue has been localized," reported Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's health law
The U.S. Supreme Court today held that Barack Obama's landmark health law is a constitutional one, which is a major victory for the Obama administration.
In a vote of 5 to 4, the judges ruled that separate orders under the patient protection and accessible health care law requiring citizens to acquire health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine were constitutional under the Government's tax authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined four more liberating members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and JFK were against it.
The Court also kept the rest of this 2700-page law in force and further held that the requirement of the Public Health Act that states improve the compatibility of the Medicaid programme, otherwise they lose all the federal funding of the Medicaid program, is not unconstitutionally coerced.
Twenty-six states and the National Independent Business Federation filed an action to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Football is the cause of the difference?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the Open Forum, politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
One of the suggestions was to ban football in the North Caucasus, because it's a game of scandals and discord.
Speaker Sergei Narishkin recounted recent events in Birylew and said that in order to reduce the degree of social tension, politics and the media must be correct in their remarks.
He probably meant the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovski, who in one of the broadcasts threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire unless they wanted to limit birth...
All speakers spoke of measures to control migration from the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and of measures to reconcile relations among the peoples of Russia, which gave the debate confusion.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biroulev were "a model conflict that could have been predicted," but "for these questions we have too many people and institutions to answer," and seven sitters have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe had long practiced with respect to immigrants, had, in the opinion of the public, failed and must be found.
Historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes in a new single history textbook.
"There is also a need to create a manual on the history of the nation's culture so that students in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Daguestan, and vice versa," he said.
Genady Sieganov suggested criminalizing "the calls for the dismemberment of Russia": "If you say on the radio in the United States that you must give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years' imprisonment!"
Vladimir Zhirinowski was trying very hard to "do not burn."
As usual, he blamed journalists who put sick and acute national problems on the public debate, saying, "There's nothing to talk about in the heat of the debate."
The leader of the One Russia faction, Vladimir Vasiliev, immediately advised journalists to conclude a "hart" and agree to talk carefully about the subject, and then the same responsibilities can be assumed by politicians as well.
We have some 30 laws that govern migration and have generally established order, as stated by Mr. Vasiliev.
He gave an example of a law that held the regional and municipal authorities responsible for inter-national peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andrichenko did not share the admiration for this law: it does not “exactly understand what it means to adapt migrants, its mechanisms, and its limits.
Therefore, the scope of these powers will be interpreted differently by the subjects.
In addition, the municipalities do not have the necessary staff to deal with such complex issues, no tools and no guidance available to them from the centre....
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities, Gadjimet Safaraliev, had suggested the establishment of a special agency with the formidable title “The Ministry of National Security” to deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who had been head of a similar department in the 1990s, which had since been abolished, objected.
It's enough to have at the federal level a special person, a "secretary without a briefcase," to whom you could contact if anything happened.
"We walk on the edges, the shells are tearing apart, and it's very important for people of different ethnicities and faiths to stand up together to provoke, and this work should be supported with decent information," said the representative of the RPT for links with the society of the Allvolod Chaplin.
No State ' s neutral attitude towards dangerous ideologies, including religious ones, should, in its view, be.
Here Oleg Neilov took the discussion into a sudden direction, saying, "More talented people than in Chetchen or Duguestan need to find more, but they're pushed to the wrong path, the wrong way," he said.
"The wrong road" is the development of football: "The football player is beaten with the whole crowd, the flags are burned, the comrades are throwing stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There's another sport called rugby...
"They won't be equal in the world in this sort of sport!" said the lawyer earnestly.
No one will play in the Rugby in the Caucasus!--at once Mr. Zhirinowski intervened.
You'll offer them a curling!
You need to know the national characteristics, it's like offering a Georgian Zaporozian...
In Jaroslavla, wild behavior on the stand was distinguished by the Moscow Club during the game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
The head of the Russian Federation Monitoring and Disciplinary Committee, Arthur Grigorianz, reported that "Cubian" was fined 500 thousand roubles and handed over from the Football House to the Clutter "SE" by Philip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the Reddar Club have been applied for arson of the flag of Dagestan by fans on the stand during a home match of the 14th Tour against Ange.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a man from the Russian Federation.
We've been researching all the available materials.
For the misbehaved behaviour of Cuban spectators, it is fined 500 thousand roubles.
Google, Samsung, Huawei has filed patent claims against Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent claims against mobile phone companies on Thursday, including Google, which it interrupted at the Nortel Bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consort, which had bought $4.5 billion of Nortel patents, filed a patent infringement suit with the U.S. District Court against Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawi and four other companies.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of breaking seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help compare key searchwords with appropriate advertisements, which are the basis of Google's search business.
Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not available and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones based on the Google Android operating system, which competes violently with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Northel patents.
Google raised the proposed price several times, eventually offering an entire $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel Rockstar patent case, Google bought Motorola Mobile for $12.5 billion, and the key factor in the transaction was partly the Motorola Patent Library.
“Despite the unsuccessful attempt to purchase the patents that are the subject of the action at auction, Google has broken and continues to violate them,” states the court action.
Rockstar requires increased compensation from Google because he claims that Google's infringement of patent rights is premeditated as required.
Egypt takes the oath of the first freely elected President
Muhammad Mursi is sworn in, but the day of its celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he took an oath, becoming the first freely elected President of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the shore of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We want a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Morsi during a solemn ceremony broadcast live on State television.
“Today the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life — absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years was a prohibited organization that was targeted by successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police officers when Morsi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred followers gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new President, and unlike the Mubarak Presidential Pump, the movement was stopped only for a short time to skip his convoy on the usually lively road connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
While Morsi was ridiculed as a non-harmonic "Britain's spare wheel," his personal reputation has increased sharply since his victory and Friday performance, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists, but also for all those who want to complete the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Morsi, wearing a blue business suit with a red tie, to the judges in the wooden hall where he took the oath.
Mursi later went to Cairo University, where he was to give his opening speech.
He received an official reception with an army band that performed the national anthem, during which he was standing on the stand “at ease”.
A military officer from the Hussain Tantavi field marshal was present.
His arrival was greeted with the motto “Army and People One Hand” which was chanted by hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as the mainstay of secular education, the University of Cairo became a branch of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where a riot erupted which ended the authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year, and promised to regain the presidency, which had been revoked by the military council, which had taken matters from the overthrown leader.
But by agreeing to take a formal oath of office before the court rather than before the parliament, as is customary, he does the military's will, and that is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Another meeting of the Tumen Oblast Engineering Association was held at the Yalutorow Automobile Plant.
The event presented a new line for the production of electric pipes from steel.
As explained by the business director, Denis Gribanov, a marketing study on the steel market in the Tumen region was carried out in 2011 with the emergence of a new owner.
It turns out that the region consumes over 50,000 tons of electric pipes per month.
It was then decided that the plant ' s profile should be modified and that the plant should be fitted with equipment for production.
Already this year, more than 7,000 tons of manufactured goods have been shipped.
An investment in the factory amounted to over 120 million roubles, said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new state was launched, allowing for an increase in the number of people.
The plant produces both a small profile of a pipe used for the household, small-scale construction and furniture industry, and a large one for the construction industry.
It is expected that 50,000 tons of products will be produced per year, representing about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees in the plant has not decreased -- it now stands at 157 -- and in plans to purchase new equipment, an increase of more than 50 employees.
The company is re-trained and the necessary professionals are drawn from the existing ones.
Next year, a new longitudinal cutting unit is expected to be up to five millimeter thick, which will reduce the cost of the product as well as another plant, at a rate of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014 the company is about to learn how to produce pipes that are used in the residential sector.
The management of the company aims to close up to 70 per cent of the requirements of the Tumen region for this product.
The Vice-Director of the Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostromov, called upon the heads of the industry to pay more attention to the upgrading of the engineering industry.
This includes forms of government support for industry, which include payment of interest rates for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of its lease.
This year, 150 million roubles have been allocated for this purpose, two thirds of which have already been spent.
The last commission to consider subsidies will receive documents from businesses by 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses the cost of local industry participating in international fairs.
The next year's budget is 150 million roubles, which can be used to compensate for lease payments and credits for the purchase of new equipment.
Five million will be allocated to fairs, three million will be allocated to energy conservation programs.
It reduces to 72 million roubles of money to reimburse the ordered and paid equipment, which is manufactured in the southern Tumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostromov, this form of support will eventually cease, as the reason for its introduction was to compensate for the mineral taxes that oil companies paid to the district budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies are becoming direct spending obligations of the region.
In view of this, the Government of the region considers it a priority to directly support the industry rather than to finance through it the oil industry.
The budget assistance will relate to investment projects that will be implemented in the workplace.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the current situation with the oil industry.
The subsidy for the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage for the industry in the southern Tumen region, and if it is cancelled, it will be difficult to compete at the price of the average strip of Russia, where cheaper labour is available.
In addition, the issue of the continuity of the new owner of the TNCs-XB, Rosneft, which had not yet placed its orders in the Tunisian industry, was not clear.
The agreement for the implementation of the Utav project expires in 2013 and no extension has been requested.
At present, the southern industry, which specializes in equipment for the oil and gas sector, is unable to form a future year's orders.
The question remains whether taxes from the oil extracted in the Utav region will be paid into the region's budget or paid at the place of registration by the new owner of the deposit.
Tomich will work 240 hours for an extremist social media video.
The Lenin District Court of Tomsk sentenced the resident of the city to 240 hours of work, who posted a video of extremist orientation on the social network, to the RIA News on Friday by a representative of the Regional Court's press service.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his popular social network page, which was placed on a federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case has been brought against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, “Actions designed to incite hatred and enmity and to humiliate a person committed in public”.
"The Lenin Regional Court considered the case in a special manner and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned offence by imposing a sentence of 240 hours' work to be required," said the interviewee.
She added that the man had fully pleaded guilty.
Azarov promised the Ukrainians a collapse of goods prices after signing an association with the European Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that prices in the country will decline significantly once the country has signed an association agreement with the European Union.
He announced this during his Facebook chat with readers.
I can certainly say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including Customs payments.
With the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area provision, the level of Customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will significantly decrease.
And that would mean that prices should also fall.
"It's about goods coming from EU countries," wrote Azarov.
As for other goods, the effect of the agreement on prices would not be so direct; it would be indirect.
However, there shouldn't be any price hikes there either.
So the reports on the billboards, which have recently appeared a lot in our country, that the association with the EU is a price increase, that's not quite the case, or, to be exact, that's not the case,' summed up by Azarov.
Investigators check information on child abuse in Biysk
On 29 October, the media published a report that the teacher of one of the children's gardens in Biyska had locked the child in the cellar for educational purposes.
Investigators are currently examining all the circumstances, as well as legal evaluation of the actions of day care officers.
After the charge of the mal taste of Yevgeny Basileva spoke
Yevgeny Vasiliev, who has received close media attention for almost a year, has yet to comment on numerous press publications both about theft in the Ministry of Defence and about her personally -- the relationship with former Defence Minister Anatoly Serdukov, her poetry, and her addiction to valuable things.
However, on November 1, the figure in the Defence Service case broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News Basileva, she said, "The first thing to do was, of course, to get any negative information out of me about the former Minister of Defence."
There was a blackmail to say I had to testify, or I'd be jailed.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Next we go to court, we'll prove our innocence.
We're 100% sure of victory.
The interview concluded that perhaps Basileva was the most affected by what was said about her taste.
It probably refers to the statement made by the official representative of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Markin, that the collection of pictures collected by the figurer in the Defence Service case found a forgery.
Among the property seized are a number of paintings which the landlady, confident of her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world art.
However, the scientific examination ordered by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and, simply speaking, were cheap counterfeits,” Markin remarked in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
Then they said they weren't stolen from the DOD, and they said I had bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, discuss some personal matters?
I think it's just a mess," says Vasiliev.
However, on the question whether she pleaded guilty to any of the 12 criminal incidents she was accused of, Vasiliev said, "Nor of course.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there was no harm to the Russian Federation in question.
They just mislead people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the Russian Federation that Vasiliev was avoiding the examination of the criminal case file, the lawyer of the figurenant said that he and his client were “not allowed to consult the case file”.
What led to the discovery of the house arresting Basileva, who had not yet spoken to the press?
Perhaps as a woman she couldn't help answer the bad taste charge?
Or is it true that the reporters of Comsomole, who claimed a couple of days ago that she had fallen into an even larger trance under house arrest because of the news of reconciliation between Anatoli Serdukov and his wife and his return to the family?
A famous military observer for the KP, Victor Baranets, in his article "Hearts back to his wife?" wrote, "The followers do not rule out that, after such a shock, she may become more talkative in questioning."
Previously, Basileva had taken over some of the charges of illegal sale of real property by the Ministry of Defence.

Do you think the travel agents have gone back because of the Internet?
The Flight Centre seems to have a reverse tendency.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and is expecting record income from vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
This tourist company now expected its main total annual revenue before tax to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with the previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current targets are met, this will be a 12 to 17 per cent increase over the record yield of $290.4 million in 2011/2012.
The Managing Director, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had earned 8 percent in the first half of the year and had begun the second half of the year with good performance, especially on Sunday trips to Australia and the United Kingdom.
“Since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profit in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have record high returns in the whole year before interest and tax contributions,” he said.
--This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which usually brings us the greatest revenue."
In Australia, leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, compensating for a somewhat weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Likewise, in the UK, the Flight Centre's leisure business went well, while corporate clients spent less.
Her business in the U.S. has offset the losses incurred during the seasonly weak first half of the year and is expected to earn a profit for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre stock rose by three cents to $38.20.
On October 31, the Barnaul police discovered two games halls.
The first one worked in the industrial district on the Ivy Street.
At the time of the check, there was a game going on.
There were 24 automatics at the club.
Another game club was found in the Lenin district on Anton Petrov Street.
This is where 20 games were used.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation for Barnaul reports that administrative material has been prepared on the subject of illegal organization and conduct of gaming.
The technique has been seized.
In the near future, the facts will be sent to the courts of the Industrial and Lenin Districts of the city.
In Yekaterinburg, the perp killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are searching for a criminal who has brutally murdered two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As reported to the “New Region” in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlov region, the day before the day before, in the Kirov district of the Ural capital, after a fire broke out in a three-room apartment located in a dwelling on Ural Street, the bodies of two women with signs of violent death were found.
Shortly afterward, the identities of the dead were discovered.
It turns out they're sisters, one of them is a 44-year-old Yekaterinburg woman, and the other is a 33-year-old Orenburg woman.
They rented a burnt apartment a few days ago.
His investigation came under the personal control of the main police force in the region, Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs agencies have been working on various versions of the murder and have tested the previously convicted citizens and persons who are prone to such acts.
In addition, it is determined for what purpose the women had rented the apartment and where they had lived before, what they had been doing, with whom they had been in contact.
Schools called for more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
The English Literature School will require students to study at least one Shakespeare piece, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry and modern British art literature since 1914.
The examination will also introduce “external texts” to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to take a separate final exam in the language, with persistent recommendations for choosing English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education is expected to issue a new curriculum on English and Mathematics tomorrow, the first subject to be radically re-examined.
It will make changes to other core items next year.
The OFQUAL Examinations Authority will present a revision of the structure of the secondary school exams, with a new system of evaluation and a smaller number of courses.
Speaking in the summer, the Minister of Education, Michael Gove, said that there was “a broad consensus that we must reform our exam system in order to restore public confidence” by insisting that school exams would be “more complex, more ambitious and more rigorous.
Research shows that English schools spend less time in mathematics (116 hours a year, or 3 hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has about 138 hours in school.
While there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on the mathematics schedule, sources in the coalition said that large school math exams, combined with a higher score in the rating table, are likely to provide an incentive for schools to provide additional education on this subject.
In terms of education, more attention will be paid to “real-life assignments”, including financial mathematics.
Hayhe tickets will cost tourists 2,200 rubles.
As of tomorrow, tourists from the Charming in Heiha will start shipping ships on air pillows.
For those who want to go to China, this means extra costs.
A Puma ticket is usually much more expensive than a steamboat.
As reported by the AmurASCO Reference Service, the normal ticket will cost 2,200 rubles.
The drive through the comfort room will cost 2,800 rubles.
By the way, these seasons did not cost fares: the pums carried tourists at the same price in the spring and the fall a year ago.
Dmitri Medvedev: GDP growth rate of the Russian Federation is not sufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev considers the Russian Federation's GDP growth to be insufficient and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of business credit and changing the structure of the Russian economy, based on innovation, reports the Reuters.
We've been planning GDP growth this year in the area of 3%, maybe even a little more.
It'll actually be a little less than 2%.
Against the background of a recess in a number of European countries, it seems not very bad, but it is not enough for us, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries, and indeed, in order to develop, there must be a faster pace.
Now it's very important that Russian companies, Russian businesses, get normal credit at the right price -- that's the first thing you have to do," stressed the head of government.

Travel on dirt, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country -- just one per 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 major heroes to become the hero of the year CNN.
This man will get 250,000 dollars to continue his outstanding work.
During the course of 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father come back to life and become unconscious again, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jameth Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the infection that had occurred spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of itself for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwell.
If we had the money, we'd have got him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could receive.
"It's not easy," said Bwell.
- You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor per 5,000 people.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could go to a doctor, many of them wouldn't be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of health spending are private.
“The only problem is poverty,” said Bwell.
And because of poverty, they can't enjoy their lives."
As Bwelle saw the suffering of his father and many of his countrymen, he was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers carried out 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vessel surgeon at Yaoundé Central.
He also founded ASCOVIME, a non-profit organization, which organizes weekend visits to the village to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have provided assistance to nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others are loaded into vans, tied to roofs and travelling across the border to visit the villages in need.
They don't always have luck.
On many occasions they had to push cars across rivers and dirt.
But when they come, they're greeted as real heroes: it's a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms the locals can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed an occasion for a holiday, and Bwelle, with his broad smile and unlimited energy, is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
"We take 500 people on every trip," said Bwell.
They come from all over the county within a radius of 60 miles from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics provides a variety of health services on a day-to-day basis.
Many people are treated for malaria, TB, Malnutrition, Diabetes, Parasites and STDs.
Others can get crucifixes, donated glasses, or free birth certificates — documents needed for school, which many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school building, a town hall or a house; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the post-op zone to vacate the room for the next person.
Using the generator to light up the operating and cleaning of the equipment, Bwell and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It's a slow pace, but the team's dedication usually helps support village musicians.
"They've been beating drums all night to keep us awake and keep working," said Bwell.
On Sunday, the crew members go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, has carried out 700 free operations over the past year, and they know that their help can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that a free hernia surgery he had received would enable him to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these weekends and work at the hospital, the Bwelle surgeon also works at night in private health clinics around Yaoundé.
This second job, he said, provides 60% of the funding for his non-profit organization; the rest is covered by private contributions.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Cathy O'Malley, a second-year doctor at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bwell band.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to make money for the organization so he can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, coming from the US and Europe to join Bwell in his tasks, this is an opportunity that they would never have received at home.
"We've got the opportunity to assist in operations where we've helped remove blood stains or keep the tools for Dr. Bwellet," said O'Malley.
As a second-year student, you would never have had that opportunity in America.
Visitors usually pay their own travel to Cameroon, often with donated drugs.
But when they arrive in Yaoundé, their food, transport and training are paid by Bwell.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He is giving his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is infinite.
For Bwell, almost constant workload is not a difficult test.
Helping others to live a happy life, keeping their father’s promise is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," said Bwell.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME site and see how you can help.
Snowden has agreed to testify about Mercel's wire.
A member of the Hans-Cristian Strebele Bondestague met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the discussion, the question was whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the U.S. prosecutor's office in the case of a possible listening to the telephone of the German chancellor by the U.S. Special Observers.
Snowden offered to give the necessary evidence.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear that he knew a lot, said Hans-Cristian Strebele.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency, led by Keith Alexander, has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
But first, we have to make clear all the conditions for his arrival.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers are beginning to respond to a scandal about US spy programs.
The senate intelligence committee yesterday approved a bill imposing additional restrictions on the U.S. electronic intelligence agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all fields and areas.
This was announced to the journalists by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Maquie, at a press conference following a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglu, reported by the BELTA correspondent.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all fields and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, and we have therefore agreed that the government authorities of the two countries will provide universal cooperation and support to the business community, which establish direct trade and economic contacts with each other,” said Vladimir McKay.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all necessary conditions to do so and would extend maximum cooperation.
The Minister also reported that the next meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission had been held in Accra, at which the protocol had been signed.
The parties have developed a road map for Belarusian-Turkish interaction, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, aims at deepening bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, economic and investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture and energy, as well as the search for new forms and directions of cooperation.
"The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am confident that the current protocol will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey view each other as reliable partners," he said.
The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Achmet Davutoglu, in turn, reported that during the talks the heads of the foreign policy agencies of the two countries had decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
In the view of the Minister, trade between Belarus and Turkey needs to be increased to $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is untapped potential in this area, he considers.
Our countries have always had a very warm relationship, and we hope that they will be further enhanced and expanded in the future.
As well, all necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the success of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian companies and organizations in Turkey,” said Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama refuses to speak of health care
Among the storms of criticism, President Obama yesterday went back on his often repeated, unambiguous promise that "if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it."
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people are being notified to stop providing services from their providers, Republicans have recently criticized the President for misusing American society.
Yesterday Obama made a few changes to his original public promise.
"Most people with health insurance that works can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he called a “news-breaking” about stopping the delivery of services, Obama called on Americans who received these notifications to look for other options in the marketplace.
Most people will be able to get better, more integrated health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
"You'll get better terms," he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own may be obliged to change plans because they do not meet the new standards required by the Accessible Medical Care Act.
"Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Siebelius in a speech to the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sybelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the accessible health care law, said that the launch of the Internet sale site has been "horrifyingly bad" since October.
"I'm upset and angry as everybody else," she said.
"I really want to get your trust back."
The irritated Siebelius dropped this phrase, caught by an on-line microphone, sitting behind her to the assistant at yesterday's hearing in the room after a heated debate with a member of the House of Representatives, Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, as to whether she was obliged to take part in Obama's health programme.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long once again urged Siebelius to explain why the "architator" of the Accessible Medical Care Act did not voluntarily abandon government-funded insurance to buy a plan through Health Care.gov, which it is now imposing on millions of Americans.
Rosbalt has been revoked by the media for non-censorial fighting.
On October 31, Mosgorsud declared the registration license of Rosbalt invalid, writing "Lenta".
Roscomnadzor, for systematic and grave breaches of the media law, insisted that the agency be denied media status.
In the course of the trial, an unpleasant case was set: the court considered it possible to shut down the media, effectively denying the publication the right to issue counter-arguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
The Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most renowned private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific net: the core of the agency's exclusive publications has (and is still) drawn up notes referring to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talks about the proximity of the publication to the security structures continued throughout the agency's existence.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had a vast source base in various agencies, it was suggested that Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Victor Cerkesov, was the head of the project.
At the same time, the role of Chaplin in the Rusbalt leadership is not entirely clear: it is commonly referred to as the "project manager".
The director-general of the agency is Larissa Afonin, the editor-in-chief, Nikolai Uljanov.
Recently, Rosbalt has not been included in the national media ratings, either by quote or by audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the rate of attendance on Russian media websites in LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosebalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500 000 views) and a monthly audience of about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the past five months are notes of the Kremlin's powerlessness in its relations with Ukraine, the death of a soloist of the "King and Cock" group, pogroms in the capital city of Turbuleu.
The "Rosbalt" conflict with Roscomnadzor began in July 2013 when the media law was amended to ban non-censorial war on journalists.
The agency found illegal lexicon in two videos published on the website ("Jigit of Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot Defiled Oil Towers").
The following parties have different descriptions.
Roscomnadzor, on the basis of the videos found, accused Rosbalt of grave and systematic violations of the media law and requested the court to withdraw the licence from the agency.
In Rosbalt, it was argued that the agency's claims were illegal: first, the rollers were not editing materials; secondly, the words were disguised and, thirdly, immediately after warning the rollers were removed from the site.
The agency appealed against Roscomnadzor's claims to the justice of the peace, and when Mosgorsud accepted the Roscomnadzor suit on 22 October 2013, these complaints were still pending.
However, as early as 25, the justice of the peace had ruled against Rosbalt: the editor-in-chief, Nikolai Uljanov, had been convicted of a breach of the administrative code and had fined 20,000 roubles, 10,000 for each commercial.
Obviously, that presupposed the outcome of the Mosgorsu hearing -- if you gave up the idea that the outcome might have been anticipated earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to invalidate the Rosbalt registration certificate, effectively depriving the agency of media status.
It is not possible to say that Rosbalt remained alone during this conflict.
The agency was supported by the State Duma (the statement on behalf of the head of Roscomnadzor, Alexander Jarov, was signed on 10 October by 26 members; the document itself was submitted at the initiative of the KPRK).
The Head of the Russian Union of Journalists, Allvolod Bohdanov, the President of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Pavel Gusev, and the President of the Presidential Council for Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, declared the publication to be illegal.
Moreover, according to Bohdanov, Roscomnadzor's management even gave him some assurance that it would not work until the license was revoked.
The Rossbalt trial showed that under whose jurisdiction the media is safer in Russia today is a big issue.
Syria destroyed the chemical weapons equipment.
Syria had destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities and had recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament has been completed by Damascus the day before the deadline.
By 1 November, Syria was to destroy production and other support facilities intended to prepare for military poisoning for use by handing over the BBC.
The destruction of the very stocks of poisonous substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid 2014.
According to the representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, poisoning agents are currently in sealed storage facilities.
The international inspectors left for Syria after more than 1,400 people died in a chemical attack on 21 August in the outskirts of Damascus.
The main task of the inspectors was to keep the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and equipment.
These production capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent their repair.
The next milestone is mid-N November: by that time the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stocks of poisonous substances.
There are a lot of questions.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully verified by Western intelligence services.
They would be willing to advise the inspectors on new sites for verification if they suspected that Damascus was not fully open.
The United States believes that this shelling was carried out by regular forces.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded that the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached through Russia, destroy or undo all capacities for the production of shells, poisoning gases and liquids and filling them with these substances.
Now that this stage has been completed, the next step should be the destruction of the chemical weapons already available to the Syrian army.
It is assumed that there may be more than 1,000 tons of neural and paralytic poisoning, each-fouling mustard gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
For it to be destroyed, it is necessary for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Syrian authorities to agree on a timetable for action, which will take two weeks to begin.
The head of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Gerry Smith, said to the BBC that his inspectors had “personally observed the destruction of the equipment”.
"They no longer have the ability to further produce or mix chemical weapons," he said.
The declaration of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe stated that the inspectors had visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and had found that the factories for the production of shells and poisonous substances had either been destroyed or had been rendered useless.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to carry out an inspection there, as described in the document, but the equipment from there has been transported and verified by the experts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
According to Smith, the destruction of the chemical weapons infrastructure was " particularly difficult" because it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe won the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said that the inspectors had not yet had time to celebrate it; they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unparalleled recognition that US spying has gone "unworthy far."
John Kerry has shown a relaxation of U.S. surveillance tactics by admitting that, in some cases, US spying has gone "unworthyly far."
The secretary also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on a "autopilot" during the appearance of Edward Snowden's high-profile discovery of the spying activities of the NBA.
These leaks have put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the government, have actually taken on some of the things happening on the autopilot because this possibility already existed during the Second World War and during the very difficult years of the cold war and, of course, 11 September."
He then became the first high-level member of the U.S. government to admit that US spying had gone too far, but he stressed that no one's rights had been compromised.
He said, "In some cases this has gone too far.
And the president is determined to shed light on the matter and explain himself to people, and is now doing a thorough analysis to ensure that no one feels abused.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process."
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NBA had acted for good reasons and that his tracking operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We work in a new world where people are willing to explode themselves.
There is radical extremistism in the world, recklessly and determined to kill people, explode people and attack governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, building explosions and killing people because we were able to find out about those plans in advance."
Meanwhile, United States lawmakers will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged US spying abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terror activities with the US, said the chairman of the Council's European Sub-Committee on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murfi of Connecticut said that he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to disappointment at the surveillance by the National Security Agency.
“In the interests of US national security, it is indeed important that Europeans remain our advocates for our common anti-terror efforts,” said the first-time democracy of Murfi, who is the chairman of the Council's international relations committee on European affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I'm going to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger at these programs of the NSS."
The news that the U.N.B.A. collected millions of phone records in Europe has eroded relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were imprecise and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata that the allies collected and shared with the U.S.
Other discoveries included documents released by Snowden indicating that the NBA was monitoring the German chancellor's mobile phone, Angela Merkel, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Security, James Klopper, defended allied spying as necessary and said it was a common case on both sides.
Against the background of this noise, Murfi said that his office was arranging a visit by members of the Congress which was expected to take place this year and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and of both chambers.
The names of other participating lawmakers should be announced in the coming days.
He said that the programme of the visit was still under development.
While Murfi said that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he said that some degree of “best intentions” would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spy programs they had been using for years.
“As we can change our surveillance programs to better protect European rights, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence activities,” said Murfi.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry has to go to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address the issues of hostility against the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence.
In new members of public observation commissions, the influence of prison guards will increase
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new members of the Public Monitoring Boards (ONCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If a vote is taken, the lobbyists will increase their influence.
The ONC is the social structures that monitor conditions in places of detention.
Sergei Magnitsky's and Leonid Roszhaev's cases, the riots in the Colonel's colony--it's through the ONC that most resonant incidents are reported behind bars.
A struggle between human rights activists and lobbyists is under way to control the ONC.
At the meeting of the OPS working group on the formation of the NSC, I suggested that the selection criteria be set for human rights experience.
"It wasn't accepted, and it was written without criteria," says Valery Borschev.
Borszev, the current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, is an all-Russian human rights institution dealing with prison issues.
As a member of the State Duma of the Apple, he had drawn up a law regulating the work of the NNC.
The OPC Council should vote in favour of the composition of the PNC in 43 regions of the country.
There are less than 1,000 candidates for 1,800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balcaria competitions have not been organized due to a lack of candidates.
The OP promises to set up a pre-selection for vacant seats.
The ONC of Moscow is one of the few competition commissions, despite the fact that the new 20 will be replaced by 40 members.
According to Borszeva, in the current composition of the capital commission, 11 human rights activists and 9 activists, and in the version which is on the vote in the OP, the ratio is 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights activists wanted to join the capital commission.
However, Vyacheslav Kalininin may re-join the War Brotherhood.
He had been a member of the UNC for three years, but had never visited a prisoner.
Borschov believed that by designating his/her Chairman as the ONC, the work of human rights defenders would be unbearable, so human rights defenders did not prevent a collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, the advancement of the Silicons is coordinated by ONC member Anton Flowerkov, who heads the Russian officers, an organization that defends the interests of the security agencies.
"I don't eat babies on a trip," said the RBK Daily Anton Flowers.
He denied that he was lobbying for any lists and said that he was not going to prevent human rights activists from visiting arrested opponents.
According to Floweroff, he was not even interested in which list was currently being voted on by the OP.
He considered the publication of Borschov's information to be a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the Czech ONC.
Its former leaders will be suspended because of last year's Copenhagen unrest.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the management of the local commission had ignored the problems of the prisoners.
On the other hand, ONC Rostov-on-Don could move from human rights activists to scissors.
Of the new lists, the human rights defender chair of the local commission had disappeared, but one of his opponents had turned out to be missing, despite the fact that the Federal Public Chamber had excluded him in May 2013 for unethical behaviour.
The lists of the Moscow and Rostow Commissions of Borszew consider it "the price for the Copeisk."
The discovery of the Tolokonnikov's hope did not affect the ONC of Mordovia, which is considered to be a "powerful" force: only one human rights defender wanted to join the new generation, and she had not even accepted the papers for the competition.
Nikolai Swanidze, a member of the OPC, told RBC Daily that he had voted against the list because he was resented by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Donu.
He sent out his position to the other members of the council.
His OP colleague, Paul Gooseev, said that he had voted in favour because he liked the suggested Moscow list.
Vladislav Grib, Under-secretary of the OPS, also a member of the FSIN Research Institute, coordinated the listing of ONCs.
The Gypsy told RBK Daily that it was not right to share candidates for human rights defenders and scissors, and did not agree that the chairmen of the commissions had the power to interfere with the work of its members.
The mushroom does not predict the results of the OP Board vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, a modified version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman lodges an appeal against prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment on Phuket Island for falsely claiming that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally found guilty on 15 June by the Phuket Regional Court of filing a false complaint following a report by the Thai police that a local taxi driver had attacked on Sunday night on 10 June while two other men held her.
However, the CCTV later found that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking up a relationship with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford within two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.
She was held in local police cells until trial.
Bampford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a general-regime detention centre on the outskirts of Phuketa rather than in a adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of a former Australian League player, Peter Tanks, who applied to the Department of External Relations in Canberra for help to his daughter.
Tanks said to Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and waited for her to return to Australia.
"It was evident that it was a disturbing time, but we hope that she will safely return home as soon as possible," said Tanks.
Bampford appealed her sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently on vacation in the Krabi resort in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford was currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal might result in the court extending her sentence to two years and making her serve her sentence in an adult prison.
However, following the recent murder of Australia's travel agent, Michel Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its damaged tourist image, resulting in an acquittal.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris at the presentation of his novel "Eltisheva", translated into French.
Remember, it's this novel that became the finalist of four prizes: "The Clear Area," "The Russian Booker," "The National Bestseller" and "The Great Book."
And last year, the writer for this book was awarded a cultural prize by the government of the Russian Federation.
Roman Senchin is a certain leader in the generation of the present 30- and 40-year-olds.
Virtually every publication of its hard, modern-day stories and stories has caused violent debate among critics in many ways.
It can be argued that the combined articles on the prosa and popularism of Sentchin, the review of his books and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the beginning of the 2010s.
In discussions about the works of “one of the most indisputable modern writers,” according to critic Sergei Chuprinin, the speech is mostly about what the participants mean by the word “literary” as seen by the present and future not only of our words, but of our lives.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow most articles and reviews from the regional media and the blogosphere to be included.
Analytic and overview articles are usually provided in abbreviations under the headings "Absolutes..."
