Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they will “joint with the maples”
Some CAs are horrified to recommend that their title be changed to "A Member of Parliament of Wales" (MWP).
This advice came about because of plans to change the name of the assembly to "Parliament Welsh".
And the whole political spectrum is concerned that it can make fun of you.
One of the laborers said that his group was worried about the Rimes with Twp and Pwp.
For users outside Welsh: in Welsh, "twp" means "unthinkable," and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
The Welsh Party has declared that its group is generally "unsatisfied" and offers alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservatories said that his group was “insensitive” about changing the name, but he pointed out that MWP could quickly become a “mappet.”
In this context, the Welsh word "w" is like the Yorkshire word "u".
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently developing a law to change names, observed: "The rest of the decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be taken by the members themselves."
The Welsh Self-Setting Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public discussion of the proposal, and the renaming of the Assembly to the Welss Parliament received wide support.
As for the name of the CA, the commission suggests that they be called "the members of the Wels Parliament," or WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest public support.
Of course, CAs offer alternatives, but trying to agree might cause problems to head Elien Jones, who should submit a bill to change for a few weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the work of the assembly, including rules for the exclusion of the FA and the structure of the committee system.
WHEN the law is discussed, there will be a final vote on its new name.
The Macedonians are going to vote for a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the elections will announce whether to change the name of the country to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The vote was organized to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athene has long argued that the name of their northern neighbour is a claim in Greek territory, and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's EU and NATO membership.
President George Ivan of Macedonia, who opposed a referendum to change his name, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, the voters of the referendum, including the Prime Minister of Zoran Zayev, argue that changing the name is just the price that should be paid for joining the EU and the North Atlantic Organization.
Call Saint-Martin in silence, for the Harlem Church is going through difficult times.
"The old people I've been talking to say that there was a bar and a church at each corner," says Mr. Adams.
Now there's neither."
He thinks it's clear that bars disappear:
"In modern times, people are socializing differently.
Bars are no longer the local hotel they regularly visit."
As far as churches are concerned, Adams fears that the money from the asset sale will not be as long as the leaders expect, and that they will be “early or late where they started.”
Churches, he added, can replace buildings with condominiums, and there will be people living there who will not help the shrines that remain nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white,” Adams explained, “so it will accelerate the day when all these churches will close, since it is unlikely that most of those who move to the Condominium will become their members.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: a metropolitan community church was built in 1870, and St. Martin was built ten years later.
The root white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The black community, which had held rituals near here, had acquired ownership of the building.
Saint-Martin moved to the black community under the direction of reverend John Howard Johnston, who led the boycott of the corrupt merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's main commercial street, and those merchants did not want to hire black people and raise them in the service.
In 1939 the fire seriously damaged the building, but the parishioners of Father Johnsson wanted to rebuild it and set up a carillon.
The reverend David Johnsson, son and heir of Father Johnston in St. Martin, proudly called the Carillon the "poor bells."
The expert who played the Carillon in July called it a different one: "cultural treasure" and "unchangeable historical tool."
This expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also pointed out that this is the world's first carillon to be played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to a larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merrivester, he was not replaced in St. Martin.
What's happening in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and subscribings, some of whom have been involved by church leaders and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The council, a leadership body of civil leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, concerned that the diocese would “try to pass on the expenses” to the district, while the council did not participate in the employment of the architects and subcommissioners sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that there was no transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injured a 13-year-old boy who ran behind the lobsters in California.
According to officials, on Saturday, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him, and a boy pinged behind the lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place almost at 7 a.m. near Bicon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that Saturday morning he had been running around half an hour with his friends when he heard the boy shouting for help, and along with a group rushed to get him out of the water.
Humble first thought it was just a catch of lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, "I've been bitten!
I've been tasted!"
As soon as he got to the boy, he found that his collarbone was completely broken.
"I shouted to everyone to come out of the water, "in the water of a shark!" added Humblel.
The boy was taken to the Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of the shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
The rescue captain, Larry Giles, told the media that a few weeks ago a shark had been spotted in this area, but it was found that it did not relate to dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries to the upper body.
For 48 hours, the authorities blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablade to Swami in Encinitas.
Giles notes that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the British market for cosmetics
Sainsbury's going to compete with Bots, Superdrug, and Debenhams using island-like cosmetics, like those in the suburbs.
As part of the enhanced British cosmetics market entry of £2.8 billion (which continues to grow at a time when the volume of sales of clothes and household goods decreases) the increased islands with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and the following year, if the idea is successful, the islands will appear in other stores.
Investment in cosmetics is linked to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the space used by television, microwave stoves and household goods.
The Sunsbury's stated that they double the assortment of cosmetics and offer up to 3000 products, including the first such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PowPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees astonishment will have more space: brand areas like those in shops like Bots.
The Supermarket also updates the Boutique assortment: now most of the goods presented will not be tested on animals, which are more and more demanded by young consumers.
Besides, the separator of the French Shop perfume is protesting his trays in two Sainsbury's shops: the first tray opened in Croydon, Northern London, last week, and the second one opened in Selly-Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and moving to the purchase of small amounts of food every day in small shops forces supermarkets to make extra effort to attract visitors.
Mike Coupe, the Managing Director of Sainsbury's, stated that their shops would look more like a department store, as the supermarket network was trying to resist Aldi and Lidl drives with more services and non-food items.
Sunsbury's opening up Argos offices in hundreds of their shops, as well as opening a series of Habitats offices.Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and said that it had increased sales of food goods and made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to upgrade the cosmetics and pharmacy branches failed.
Sainsbury's had tested their collaboration with Bots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute about how to share the income from supermarkets.
The new strategy came after the Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy business (281 pharmacies) to Célesio, owner of the Loyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds a year ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an extended suite of leather-small brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vicky, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Saintsbury, said: "We have changed the appearance of our island with cosmetics to make the atmosphere more pleasing to the customers.
We also invested in specially trained counselors who would be able to give advice.
The brands that we have presented are called upon to meet any needs, and the pleasant environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is the competition of the old way of buying."
Peter Jones was "separated" because Holly Willoughby had entered into an agreement worth 11 million pounds sterling.
Peter Jones's Dragon Footer is "disappeared" because Holly Willoughby's TV broadcaster came out of a deal with his brand of goods for life (the contract is 11 million pounds sterling) to focus on new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for home clothes and Truly's axes.
The couple's business was related to Goop Gwinette Peltrow's brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced that she would join Instagram.
Holly Willoughby led Peter Jones's star "The Dragon's Fist" to the story when at the last moment she came out of their lucrative business of goods for life to focus on the new win-win contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones is "disappeared" when a gold girl on TV confessed during a busy Tuesday meeting at the Jones Business Empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal of 1.5 million pounds of sterling means that she no longer has sufficient time to dedicate it to their common home clothes brand and Truly axes.
This business was associated with the Goop Gwinette Peltrow brand and had doubled the value of Willoughby, which is estimated to be 11 million pounds sterling.
When Willoughby reported to Instagram that she was coming from Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of her rest houses.
The source reported: "Truly was no doubt Holly's main priority.
He was to be her long-term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby's decision to quit the business was astonished by all interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost before the launch.
At Marlowe's head office, there's a full set of things ready for sale.
The experts believe that the entrance of this Morning, one of the highest-paid stars in the UK, could cost companies millions of dollars because of large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothes and home clothes) and create further delay with the launch.
This may also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children of Willowby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of government in March.
The couple spent the holidays together, and Jones owns 40 percent of the shares of a company called Baldwin, which is involved in television production.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand agent and replace Anthony McPartlin as the lead I'm A Celebrity with ITV.
The source near Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism that the news media would get for commenting on what someone would think of as "non-parliamentary," as well as for the very positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
"Why did President Trump do such great things?"
said Trump, imitating the voice of the announcer.
I didn't go to any action."
He remarked that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a great step towards deducing North Korea.
But the deductive talks went into a deaf corner.
More than three months after the June alone in Singapore, North Korean leader Ri Young Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not see a "matchful response" from the United States to its first steps in disarmament.
Instead, he remarked, the US continues with pressure-enhancing sanctions.
Trump was much more optimistic when he spoke at his meeting.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea," he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have such a beautiful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: the completion of rocket tests, the release of the hostages and the return of the remains of the United States military forces home.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave as a president, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this pile of filled-up stadium, we've got about 200 people standing right there," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the Lomboca earthquake, foreign non - government organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lomboca had suffered, the national catastrophe had not been declared, and that was a transformation for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they did not seek international assistance, so it's a bit difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to go to Pale, it is not yet known whether foreign staff will be able to work locally.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the national disaster management agency, said that Indonesian authorities were measuring the situation in Palau to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
In view of the constant occurrence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains horribly unprepared for natural rage.
In Aceh Province, a shelter against the tsoons has been built, but it is not typical of the other coasts.
The apparent absence of a warning siren about the Tsunamis in Palau, although the warning was a valid one, probably contributed to death.
Moving between a myriad of Indonesian islands is not just in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logic even more difficult.
The medical ship that was in Lomboca to treat the victims of the earthquake is sailing to Pale, but at least three days from now it will be possible to get to the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made improvements in Indonesia's infrastructure the basis of his campaign and increased the costs of roads and railways.
But the funding gap has created problems for Mr. Joko's administration, who plans to change next year.
Mr. Joko has also been prevented from perpetrating inter-confessional enmity in parts of Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died, tens of thousands of people hunted out of their homes as a result of resistance by Christian and Islamic gangs on the streets, using maceets, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look: Daniel Starridge from Liverpool scores a goal from the bottom of the field and compares the score to the "Chelsey"
Daniel Starridge saved the Liverpool from the defeat of the Chelsey in Premierly with his bare body for the 89th minute Saturday at the London Stadium Stadium, Stamford Bridge.
Starridge got a pass from Jerdan Shachiri when he was about 27 meters from the door of Chelsey. At that point, his team was playing with an account of 1-0.
He pushed the ball to his left leg and loaded it in the direction of a far-reaching trout.
The ball flew high above the penalty in the direction of the upper right corner of the gate.
He flew over the jumping Cape of Arrisabaluga and fell into the gate.
"It was just an attempt to take a position without losing time; players like Shachiri are always going to attack as much as possible, so I've just tried to provide myself with as much time as possible," said Starridge LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, and I made one touch, I didn't think about it too much, and I just took the ball.
"Chelsey" went with a score of 1-0 after the first time that the Belgian star, Eden Azar, scored a goal for 25 minutes.
The blue attacker passed back to Mateo Kovacic, turned around the middle of the field and ran fast half the Liverpool.
The Kovacian quickly played the wall inside the field.
Then he made a fine penetrating pass, which brought Azar to the fine.
Azar ran his defence and struck his left leg in the grid of a long distance, and the ball passed over Aliceson Becker's Liverpool gateway.
Liverpool plays against Napole in a group phase of the League of Champions at 3 p.m. Wednesday at the São Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
"Chelsey" plays with Videoton in the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. Thursday in London.
The number of Tsunami deaths in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths due to earthquakes and tsoons in Indonesia has increased to 832, reported by the Indonesian agency for the management of the consequences of disasters on Sunday morning.
Many people remained trapped in a wreck of buildings destroyed by a 7.5-point earthquake that caused waves of six meters high, reported to the press secretary of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Pale, where more than 380,000 people live, has been sunk with pieces of destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man for suspicion of murder after a woman had been stabbed to death.
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Mercyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with a stab wound in Grayson Mews, John Street, suspected of having been arrested by a 32-year-old man in the murder.
The police called for a response from people who had seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan remarked: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I'm asking everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who could film something on the video recorder to contact us, because the information on this video can be very important to our investigation."
The policeman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the house.
Today, in the afternoon, friends who believe they know a woman have come to the scene of crime to ask where they found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said that they are now informing the nearest relatives of the victim.
The taxi driver who lives in Grayson-Muse just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police said that nobody was allowed to come in and out of the house.
When he found out what had happened, he lost his tongue.
People are now told that it will be hours before they are allowed to go home.
Someone heard a policeman tell a man that the whole neighborhood is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene of the crime, a woman appeared in tears.
She says, "It's so awful."
At 2 p.m. two police vans were standing outside the fence, and another van was standing in front of the fence.
Several police officers were standing outside the fence and following the apartment building.
Anyone with information is requested to write a direct message to @MerPolCC, call number 101, or anonymously call the Krimestoppers line at number 0800 555 111 and call code 247 and date 30 September.
The Cromwell article near Parliament becomes a new monument that suffers from the "census of history"
The removal of the statue would have been a well-deserved payment for the destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts in the Taliban style of England by its fanatical puritan followers.
But Cromwell's division called Mr. Creek's offer "a fool" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, the head of Cromwell's Division, said: "Because of the current debate about the removal of the statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace would become a target, it was inevitable."
Iconistries during English civil wars were not carried out by Cromwell himself or by his command.
Cromwell is likely to be undeservedly sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The great statue of Cromwell's sculptor, William Hamo Thornecroft, is evidence of the moods of the 19th century and part of the history of the art that many think is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "A great deal more likely to be in the late 19th century than now sees Cromwell as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, of course, in his case, of the monarchy.
Whether that idea is perfectly accurate is the subject of the historical debate that continues.
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has defined the future of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the famous articles that represents one side of this conflict.
Its achievements as a Lord Protector should also be celebrated and respected."
The killer pig killed a Chinese farmer to death.
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China.
A man identified only by the name of Yuan was found dead in blood, with a broken artery near a pig shop in Liupanchuy, Guizhou Province, reported to South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In Sinin, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, a pigyard is about to immunize pigs in a pig shop.
It is reported that on Wednesday he drove out with his cousin from the neighbouring Province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the brother found him dead and saw that the pork door was open.
The brother remarked that there was a large boar in the pig shop with blood on his mouth.
The court medical experts confirmed that a 249-pound boar had destroyed the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloodthirsty and corrupted," said a cousin who had suffered with the name Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security footage showed that Yuan had entered the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evaning News that when the police collected evidence at the scene, the pig was locked to prevent it from attacking people.
It's reported that the seven I'm Yuan and the market administration are talking about compensation for his death.
Though rare, cases of pig attacks on people have been recorded before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and caused critical injuries to a man.
Ten years earlier, a 295 - kg - weighted pig kept a Welsh farmer pressed to a tractor until the farmer’s wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon had eaten his own pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba said CBC News said that pigs were usually not aggressive, but blood taste could become a triger.
"They're just playing.
They're like kids, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with due respect," he said.
Hurricane Rose will bring massive rains to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa was predicted to collapse, moving over the colder waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the nearest days, Rosa will bring rains with floods north of Mexico and southwest of the United States.
Rose had a wind speed of 127 km per hour (this is a hurricane of category 1) and was about 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, on Sunday morning, 5 a.m.
Rose is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific is beginning to form a rainstorm that moves eastward to the West coast of the United States, and when Rose comes to the lower coast of California on Monday, it starts to push a strong tropic rainy cloud northward to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25.4 cm rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next, on the nearest day, the tropical moisture that interacts with the nearest log will create strong rains in the southwest.
In this area, between 2.5 and 10.2 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, garbage streams, and desert potential.
Strong tropical moisture will increase the amount of precipitation in places to 5–7.6 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain 5–10,2 cm in some parts of the southwest, especially in a significant area of Arizona.
Floods are possible when conditions worsen due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We strongly advise you not to go to the desert on foot, for there are possible tropical rains.
The heavy rain can make the canyons turbulent, and the storms will bring violent winds and dust storms.
The nearness of the rain will cause heavy rains in parts of the northern coast of California.
The number of rains can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause low waste streams and slippery roads.
It'll be the first rainfall in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, and on Monday and Tuesday nights the rain will become more extensive.
It's going to rain a lot on For Corners from Thursday to Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperature variations across the United States, since the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this results in sharp temperature variations at short distances.
On Sunday, we'll see a wonderful example of a sharp temperature difference in central US.
This is a nearly 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omah, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer heat will try to return and spread.
It is expected that in a significant area of the center and east of the United States it will be warm by October, and the temperature from the south to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 12 degrees Celsius above the average temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of average temperature exceedance in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Cavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, over 20 million people in six television networks watched the exciting testimony of a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Cavanaugh, and Christin Blazee Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, which had allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
The political resistance continued, and the channels interrupted the planned programs to report the latest news on Friday: a deal prepared by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake about the conduct of a one-week investigation by the F.B.I. into the charge.
Ford told the Court Committee of the Sentence that she was 100% sure that Cavanaugh was wearing it and was trying to take off her clothes at the high school evening.
Cavanaugh, in his emotional testimony, said that he was 100% sure that it had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people observed this on Friday, as reported by the Nielsen research company.
The company calculated the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Could not immediately get numbers on other networks that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of people watching TV in offices.
By comparison, such an audience is of a size like an audience that watches a game-off match or an Oscar prize.
Fox News Channel, whose broadcasters strongly supported Cavanaugh's appointment, was the leader of all the channels during a day-long listening session, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, and Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
The interview remained high after the hearing.
Strike became the centerpiece of Friday's drama.
The office of this moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote for Cavanaugh, and then, on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras caught the protesters shouting at Flake when he tried to take the elevator to the Court's Committee.
He stood there with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was lamented, broadcast in direct Ether on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
And it was said to him, 'You have power, and many women are powerless.'
Flack reported that his office published the application and, before the elevator closed, added that he would talk more about listening to the committee.
All cable and wide-ranging channels broadcast directly hours later when the Court Committee was to vote to advance Cavanaugh's candidacy for a full-fledged senate vote.
Flack said he'd only do it if he knew that the F.B.I. would look into the charges against the candidate next week, which requires a democratic minority.
Flake was partly persuaded to talk to his friend, Senator-Democrat Chris Coons.
After talking to Kuns, and then with a few Senators, Flake made a decision.
Fleka's choice had an effect, as it was evident that the Republicans would have no votes to assign Cavanaugh's candidacy without investigation.
President Trump was initiating an investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh by the F.B.I.
British Prime Minister Theresa May blames critics for playing politics around Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times, the Prime Minister, Theresa May, accused critics of her exit plans from the European Union of playing politics with the future of the United Kingdom and disrupting national interests.
On September 29, 2018, the British premier, Theresa May, arrived at a conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
In another interview that took place next to Theresa's interview on the front page of the newspaper, the former foreign minister of her government, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Checkers' Brexit Plan, saying that it would offer Britain and the European Union to draw together the message "absolutely absurd."
Who shot Wade Sims: the police arrested Dayton Simson for suspecting the death of a player at the University of Louisiana
The police arrested a suspected shooter who led to the death of Weid Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana.
The 20-year-old Dyton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison for second-level murder, reported to the Baton-Rose police department.
The authorities published video arguments between Sims and Simson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police removed the glasses from the scene of the crime and reported that they had found Simson's DNA on them, according to an affidavit by CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had confessed that he had shot Wade.
According to counsel, he was given a bail of $350,000.
The Coroner's office in East Baton-Rage published a previous report on Friday, which states that the cause of death is a fire wound to the head and neck.
The Department is grateful to the special police unit for finding fugitives from the state of Louisiana, the State police criminal lab, the University of the South police force and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
The sports director of the University of Louisiana, Joe Alleve, thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their “dust and eagerness for justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
Forward grew up in Baton Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
Last season, the average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 scores.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at the University of Louisiana, Wil Wade, said that the team was "desolated" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"That's what bothers you all the time," said Wade.
Vulcan throws ashes to Mexico City
Popocatepetl’s ash has reached the southern district of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Warning Center called on Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as the crater began to be active and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered within 24 hours.
The center traced numerous noises and pushes.
Photos from social networks show thin balls of ash on the frontal cliff of cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Hogimilko.
Geophysics have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is about 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, following an earthquake of 7.1 points in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goio, has been active since 1994.
The police encountered the Catalonian separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters who stood up for independence encountered the police unit, and thousands of people joined protesters to celebrate the first anniversary of the divisional vote.
A pro-separatist group with masks that were restrained by the special purpose threw them with eggs and powdered paint, which created dark clouds of dust on the streets, usually full of tourists.
This afternoon, the police used sticks to restrain the violence.
A few hours later, groups of independenceists who were saying, "Let's not forget, let's not forgive!" ran into the country's survivalists, who were shouting, "Let's live Spain!"
According to the local press, fourteen people were helped with the slight injuries they received during the protests.
A year after the referendum on October 1, which was declared illegal by Madrid but marked by Catalan separatists, tension in the region, which wants to be independent, remains high.
The voters generally chose to vote for independence, but the appearance was low, since most of the opponents boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting in the region.
The independence groups spent the night on Friday in tents to prevent demonstrations to support the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
The 68-year-old Narciss Termes, an electrician who took part in a secessionist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had the hope that Catalan might gain independence.
"We've been through one of our best moments this past year.
I watched my parents cry with joy, who can vote, but now we're in a deaf corner," he said.
Despite the vital but very difficult victory of last December's regional elections, the Catalan parties, which are pro-independency parties, have not been able to maintain the momentum of this year, as many of their most famous leaders are being voluntarily banished or imprisoned for their part in the organization of the referendum and the further declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who withdrew a protest against police support on the phone, said that the conflict had been provoked by politicians on both sides.
"The strain is increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in the insulator since the end of last year, announced that he would be running for the European Parliament next year.
"The status of a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regress of democratic values and reactions that we are witnessing from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after the car drove into the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car had entered a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place in Balligard-Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings observed that the gate and the house itself had been damaged.
It is possible that at some point a crossbow was fired at the car.
Menga's hit gave Livingstone a win against Rangers with a score of 1-0
The first goal of Dolly Menga in Livingstone became the winner
A high-level Livingstone puzzled the Rangers and brought Stephen Gerrard the second of 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
The impact of Dolly Menga turned out to be decisive, with Gary Holt's team rising to one level in a second from the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team won no victory on its departure to the Premier-Lise this season and next Sunday will play with the Harts leaders, from whom it is eight points away.
Earlier on Thursday, the Rangers will accept the "Rage of Wenen" within the European League.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues its invincible movement to six divisional games, and Chief coach Holt has not been defeated since he replaced Kennie Miller last month.
Livingstone misses the odds that give indignant guests.
Holt's team was supposed to be ahead of them long before they killed them, because their directness creates Rangers with all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defence, but struck along the gate, and then Alan Litgow broke through the gate after he slid back and accepted the Craig Hulquetta blow along the gate, which he made his head.
The owners were satisfied that they allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, and they knew they could cause problems to guests from their standard positions.
So a decisive goal was struck.
The Rangers missed a free shot, and Livingstone made discoveries, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up Mengo, who took the ball and beat it out of the center of the ticket.
The Rangers had previously been dominated by the ball, but the protection of the landlords had proved to be inexperienced and the gatekeeper of Limam Kelly had generally not been disturbed.
This tendency continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos was able to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's kick hit the Rangers by Allan McGregor, and Litgo hit the gate in another standard Livingstone combination.
The naves constantly flew into the Livingston penalty and were constantly neutralized, and the two applications for a penalty — after the attack on Glenn Middleton, who was replaced, and behind the game with his hand — were rejected.
Livingstone Phenomenon: Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of "BBC Scotland" at the Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
It's a fenomeen game and a Livingstone result.
All of them played a great game, and they continued to wait longer on this source trajectory.
Their style of play and composition had hardly changed since their return to the highest level, but they should give Holt the right one for the way he mobilised the team after he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halquet played a huge, very well organized defence, and Menga forced both connor Goldson and Joe Warral to keep watch.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under Gerrard's direction, but now they're far from meeting those standards.
They didn't have enough of the last ball -- just once they broke the defence of the landlords -- and it was kind of a wake-up call for the Rangers, which they found in the middle of the table.
Herogon was received in a mixed manner in the Cologne region
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, there was a smile and a blue sky.
This is the last day of President Herogon's conflicting visit to Germany, which aims to restore relations among the allies of the North Atlantic.
There were some differences among them on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new shrine.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 people from meeting in front of the sword, but many of the president's followers still came near to see it.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, among them many Kurds, have also made themselves heard, condemning the politics of Erdogan and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
Bidirectional protests indicate ambiguities among the guests, whom some Germans have called heroes and others a dictator.
Depford Road crash: A cyclist died in a car accident
A bicycle driver died in a car accident in London.
An accident occurred at the Bestwood Street Crossroads and Eveline Street on a live road in the Deptford district in the southeast of the city around 10:15 a.m. in the British Standard Time.
The driver stopped, and the paramedics came to the scene, but the man died on the spot.
This crash occurred a few months after another cyclist died after a driver had escaped from the adventure at Childers Street, about 16 miles from the Saturday accident.
The London police stated that they were working on setting up a man to inform his closest relatives.
Travel bans and bus routes have been changed, and motorists are recommended to avoid this zone.
Long-Lartin prison: six prisoners injured in disturbances
Six prison officers were injured as a result of disturbances in the men's prison of strict security, reported to the prison administration.
Her Majesty Long-Lartin's prison in Woostershire began at about 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and is still in progress.
In order to stop the disturbances, the eight incarcerated and located in the same wing, a special unit called the Tornado was called.
The officers were given medical attention in connection with the slight injuries to the face received at the scene.
A member of the prison service comments: "In order to resolve the incident which continues in the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin, a specially trained prison staff has been engaged.
Six of the co-workers received medical attention in connection with the injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and the terms of their being in custody can be doubled."
In the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin there are over 500 prisoners, among whom are the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager had been sent for statistical treatment after the prisoner's assault.
Last October, a special police unit called to prison to stop the serious disturbances in which prison guards were attacked with belliard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Las Vegas and the Salt Lake City with flooding (the drylands may benefit)
Tropical depression rarely hit Arizona, but this can happen early next week, as the remnants of Hurricane Rose are heading across the southern west of the desert, creating a risk of a flood of rain.
The National Weather Service has already published a warning of flooding on Monday and Tuesday, from West Arizona to South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rose will walk directly through Phoenix on Tuesday and Monday night it will rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix observed in Twitter that only ten tropical Cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950,
and Catrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to recent forecasts by the National Hurricane Center, the Mogollon-Rome region in Arizona has a range of 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and places up to 15.24 cm fall.
Other parts of the southern-west desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get between 2.54 and 5.08 cm of rain, possibly up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of a rainstorm, the rain of Rose can be a blessing, since the region suffers from dry water.
While flooding is a very serious problem, some of these spills are likely to be useful because the southwest is now experiencing a drying-up.
According to the United States Dry Monitoring Centre, slightly over 40 percent of Arizona is suffering at least from extreme dry water, which is the second highest category of drying, reports Weather.com.
First of all, the way of Hurricane Rose is causing a clutter in the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rose, still in the middle of a hurricane on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind speed of 125 miles per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19.3 km per hour.
The storm encounters a more colder water in the Pacific, and it erupts.
Thus, it is expected that during the tropical storms of daylight or Monday night, a hurricane will cause a dislocation in Mexico.
The number of rains in some parts of Mexico can be significant, creating a considerable risk of flooding.
"It is expected that the total number of falls from Lower California to Northwest Sonar will be between 7.62 and 15.24 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm in places," reportsweather.com.
Next, Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, get Arizona's border early in the morning as a tropical depression that goes further through Arizona and late in the evening to South Utah on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected of Rosa or her remains is the very heavy rains in Lower California, Northwest Sonar and Southwest of the American Desert," reports the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening flooding and waste streams in the deserts, as well as to landfalls in mountainous areas.
Midsomer-Norton Attack: four people arrested who attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspicion of murder after they found a 16-year-old guy with knife wounds in Somerset.
An early teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton about 4:00 p.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock district, reported to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking anyone who can have any video of these events on their phone.
Trump says that Cavanaugh had been "dreaming and angry" by the Democratic Party
"The voice of Judge Cavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," stated Trump at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavanaugh had been “didly angry and angry” by the Democratic Party during the entire hanging process.
Cavanaugh gave a witness to the Congres on Thursday, in an unimaginable and emotional way denying that he had committed sexual violence against her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness at a hearing about the charges against her.
On Saturday, the president declared that the American people had seen Cavanaugh's brightness, character and courage on that day.
"The voice of Judge Cavanaugh is a voice for one of the most perfect lawyers of our time, a lawyer with perfect experience in the public service," he said to a mob of adherents in West Virginia.
The president referred to Cavanaugh's stand when he spoke of the importance of the Republicans' appearance at the mid-street elections.
"In five weeks there will be one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running,' he said.
That's why I'm fighting for wonderful candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the mission of the democrats is to “oppose and hinder.”
It is expected that the first key procedure vote in the senate on Cavanaugh's candidacy will take place no later than Friday, and CNN has informed the assistant of one of the Republican leaders.
Hundreds of people died from an earthquake and a Tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of casualties is rising
At least 384 people died, many were washed into the ocean when huge waves hit the beaches as a result of an intense earthquake and tsoon on the Indonesian island of Sulawes, declared the country's authority on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when a wave of up to six feet (18 feet) in the darkness broke over the shore, killing a lot of people to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of 7.5 points.
"When the threat of the tsunami broke out yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach and they didn't immediately start running away and they were victims," said a representative of the Indonesian disaster management agency (BNPB) in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
"It wasn't just a tsunami, it was moving cars, trees, buildings, it hit everything on the land," said Nugroho, adding that, before it hit the coastline, it passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/year).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed the trees and survived, he added.
About 16 700 people were ejected to 24 centers in Palau.
Photographs published by the disaster management agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been turned and destroyed, and the mob is surrounded by water.
The blows in the coast town continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Evaluation and Application Authority (BPPT) stated that the energy generated by the heavy Friday earthquake was 200 times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hirosjim during the Second World War.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could contribute to the forces of the tsunami, said the agency.
Nugroho called the damage “wide-scale” and observed that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
Some of the victims were found under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had disappeared without a word.
Nugroho observed that damage and damage may be greater than 300 miles (190 miles) along the coastline north of Pale in an area called Donggal, which is near the epicentre of the earthquake.
"The lines of communication were completely corrupted, and we didn't get any information from Dongali," said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living there, as reported in the Red Cross Declaration, and it is added that its staff and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can become much bigger," said the report.
On Saturday, the agency received a wide range of criticism for not reporting that the Tsunami had hit Pale, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
From the amortized images that people shared in social networks, a man on the top of the building shouts wild warnings about the approaching of the tsoons on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, a wall of water struck the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the validity of the frames immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a serious shutdown of electricity, which cut the connection around Pale, making it difficult to coordinate rescue operations.
The military had begun to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, reported to the authorities, but the evacuees still needed food and other basic items.
The city airport was opened for help only, and it will be shut down by October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit the emergency centers in Palau on Sunday.
The number of people killed by Tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision partners with Dongali have safely reached the city of Pale, where they hide in tarpaulins installed in the courtyard of their office, but on the way they saw the scenes of desolation, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began to act decisively to address the consequences of the disaster, some complained that foreign relief workers were being prevented from going to Pale with great experience.
Under Indonesian rules, funding, providing and providing staff from abroad can only start if the place of disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of the province," remarked Aulius Arriani, a member of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says "Good, it's a national disaster," we'll be able to accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been granted."
Already the second night had fallen on Pale after a Friday earthquake and a tsoon, and friends and families of those who had not yet been found still expected that the appearance of their loved ones would become a miracle that would paint these gloomy stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday the little boy got out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers got a woman who had been lying under stones for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Hendon Subandono, a trainer for the Indonesian national team with paraplanetry, trained two disappeared paraplaners to participate in Asian games earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paramedics who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As an older paraplanerist, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon tells us that a few hours after the news about the ruin of the Roa Roa Hotel, which was spreading among the paramedics community, he was desperately sending a message on whatsApp to the opponents of Pale, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray point, not with double blue ticks.
"I think this means that the message has not been delivered," he said.
The thieves took US$ 26,750 when the ATM was filled at the Newsport on the Levie
On Friday morning, thieves stole 26,750 dollars from a worker named Brink, who ran an ATM at the Newport on the Levie, a news report to the Newport Department of the police.
The car driver emptied an ATM in a entertainment complex and was preparing to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man "walked back to his colleague Brink" and stole a sack of money intended to fill out.
The witnesses noticed a number of suspected fugitives in the news, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about these people should contact the Newport police at number 859 to 292 to 3680.
Canye West: Reper changes its name to E
Repper Canier West changes his name to E.
On Saturday, when he announced a change on Twitter, he wrote, "Previously known as Canier West."
The 41-year-old West had been called "Y" for a while, and he used this shortcut as a name for his June album.
The change occurred in advance of his appearance on the Saturday Night Live show, where he expected to present his new Yandhi album.
At the show he replaced a singer named Ariana Grande, who had cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons," reported the author of the show.
This is not just a shortening of the present professional name, but earlier West had said that the word had a religious meaning for it.
"I believe 'ee' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, talking about the title of his album with Big Boy's radio speaker.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The canyé, which means "one," was shortened to just an E, is just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Canye is one of the few famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Grandpa, P. Grandpa and Grandpa, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Brother Love.
West's former colleague, JAX, also experimented with a defiance and large letters.
President Andres Manuel López Obrador of Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico, Andres Manuel López Obrador, promised never to use the army against the civilians, and soon the country will mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody trial of the students.
On Saturday, on the Talatelloloco Square, López Obrador promised to “never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military fired a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing about 300 people, while all over Latin America began to form a left student movement.
López Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and by opening more free State universities.
He said that joblessness and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to crime groups.
The US needs to double funding in artificial intelligence.
Since China is generating activity in artificial intelligence, the US needs to double the amount it spends on research in this field, as does an investment and practicer in the AI sphere, Kai-Foo Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were given after various parts of the U.S. government had made statements about the HI, although there was no formal strategy in the U.S. in the field of Hl.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it wants to be the number one innovation in the Shea sector by the year 1930.
"The double budget for the AI study would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far behind the US, and we are preparing for the next gap in the AI field," said Lee.
Double funding can double the probability that the next big Hl thing will be done in the U.S., said Lee in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "The State of the Shi: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director-general of the Synovation Ventures Foundation, which invested in Face++, one of the world's most famous companies in China.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he was working on the Sl System, which beat the best American player in Otello, and was later the Managing Director of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee observed a previous competition with technology by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the DARPA, and asked when the following would be to help identify the next promising players.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard to win government subsidies, said Lee.
"It's not China taking academic leaders, it's corporations," he remarked.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have recently been employing a university light to work on the AI.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the US to increase efforts in the field of AI.
"I think that Green Card should automatically offer scientific candidates in the field of SH," he said.
The State Council of China published its Plan for the Development of the Artificial Intelligence of the New Generation in July 2017.
China's National Science Foundation provides funding to people working in academic institutions, just like the National Science Foundation and other US government agencies are giving money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work in China below, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence had set up a joint centre of artificial intelligence, which was intended to involve partners in industry and academic circles, and the White House had announced the creation of a special committee of artificial intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
As far as the National Science Foundation is concerned, it now invests over $100 million a year in a study of MI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. government, which wanted to set up a Commission for the National Security of Artificial Intelligence, did not take any steps within a few months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia," which will resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's ability to become a member of the European Union and the North Atlantic.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and has set a ban on Macedonia's accession to both the North and the European Union.
In June, two governments entered into an agreement based on a new name, but nationalist opponents of the agreement argue that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovak majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov declared that he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the minimum 50 percent of the voters who would be allowed to believe that the referendum was valid would be achieved.
The question in the referendum letter is, "Do you support the membership of the North Atlantic Organization (NATO) and the European Union under the terms of a Greek agreement?"
The adherents of the name change, including the Prime Minister of Zoran Zayev, argue that this is a price that Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should be paid to join bodies such as the European Union and the United Nations Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it could live freely under the European Union's yoga, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievski in Skopje.
While the result of the vote is not a legal obligation, enough members of Parliament have declared that they will support it in order to make it decisive.
To change the name, it will take two thirds of the vote in Parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that by 1 p.m. there were no reported abuses.
However, only 16 percent of the total showed up compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of the registered voters threw their papers into the boxes.
"I've come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," declared the 62-year-old pick of Ghose Tanevski in the capital of Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Straumitz, Macedonia, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zayev, his wife, Zorika, and his son Duško gave their vote in a referendum to change the name of the country, which would open the way for the accession to both the North Atlantic and the European Union.
Before Parliament in Skopje the 54-year-old Volodymyr Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and placed chairs in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for the North Atlantic and the EU, but we want to go there with our head raised proudly, not through the service door," said the Kovardarks.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zayev believes that joining the North Atlantic will bring many needed investments to Macedonia, where the rate of unemployment is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the majority vote in favour, since over 80 percent of our citizens stand for the EU and for the North Atlantic,” said Zayev after the vote.
He said that the "yes" result would be confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of the voters will take part in the referendum, which is the following.
According to another survey carried out by the Macedonian Telma television channel, 57 percent of the respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
For a referendum to be declared valid, it must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the politics of the Western government since its beginning last May.
Look: Sergei Aguero of the Manchester City runs all Briton's defence and scores a goal
Sergei Aguero and Rachim Sterling fought for Briton and led the Manchester City victory with a score of 2-0 on Saturday at the Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The Hall of Aguero for the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
An Argentine attacker was given a pass at the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three Britons and found himself in an open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He went round one defender, then ran around a few more on the edge of the Briton penalty.
Then he made a pass left, seeing Sterling.
An English forward made the first touch on the penalty room to give off the Aguero ball, which, with its right boot, launched it in the right part of the gate, defeating Matthew Ryan's Briton's Hollywood.
"Aguero has some problems with his legs," said the reporter's manager, Pep Guardiola.
We agreed he'd be playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at this moment."
But the initial advantage of the sky-blue in this match was for Sterling.
This goal took place at the 29th minute.
Aguero got a ball deep in Briton's area.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along the left flank of Leroy Sanae.
Leroy made a few contacts and then made Sterling's pass in the direction of the far-reaching trouser.
Forward of the sky-blue threw a ball at the gate just before he slipped outside.
The City will meet with Hoffhenheim in the group phase of the League of Champions at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Raine-Neqcar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to take his glasses to Rocky's
Since the Washington Nationals team came out of playoffs, there was no reason to wait.
But a competitive Sherzer hopes to go to the Pitcher bitterness on Sunday in a match against Colorado Rockies, provided that the Roxies will still have difficulty leaving for the Playoffs, and now the Rockies will have one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League.
The Rockies have at least a Wild Card for winning with an account of 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to attach the title of the first division.
"Although we're playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to leave the ball, knowing how the audience behaves here in Denver, and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level that I've seen this year.
Why don't I want to take part in this race?
The Nationals will announce who will be the starter on Sunday, but it is reported that they are leaning towards it being Sherzer.
Sherzer, for whom this is going to be the 34th start, had a pitching session on Thursday and could play on Sunday, his usual weekend.
The Washington right hand has a score of 18 to 7 of the 2.53 ERA and 300 strike outs of 220 to 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Mets in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court of Britta Cavanaugh, when he spoke of the importance of the presence of Republicans in mid-size elections.
"All we've done will be put on the map in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lives will take place.
It's one of the big, big -- I don't run, but I'm really running, so I'm fighting for wonderful candidates wherever I can," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see it happening now.
And they're determined to regain power using any means you can see villain, villain.
They don't care who's suffering from them, who's the one who needs to go through to get power and control, they want power and control, we're not going to give them."
The mission of the democrats, he said, is "to resist and prevent."
"And you've seen it over the past four days," he said, calling the democrats "vilest and mean, vile and lying."
He referred to the Senat's Court Committee, naming Senator-Democrat Diane Financial by name, who led the audience to hear loud voices of displeasure.
"Remember her answer?
Have you submitted a document?
Uh-oh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- it was a really bad language of the body-mobile -- the worst language of the body-mobile that I've ever seen."
The labor party is no longer a broad church.
It is indifferent to those who express their opinions.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to convict me, it was hardly unexpected.
After all, I'm the last of those labor members of Parliament to be told that they're not welcome, and that's because we're expressing our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated almost the same way because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semiticism.
I was convicted because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbin.
As to the importance of responsible economic policy, as far as national security is concerned with Europe, these issues are ironically similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
On Friday, the Nottingham East report says, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the evenings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the labourers were like this.
Unfortunately, many encounters today have a very different tone, and the promise of “more benevolent, softer” politics has long been forgotten if it has ever been implemented.
It's becoming more and more evident that the Laborist Party does not allow for different views, and every thought is valued on the basis of the position that it is appropriate to lead the party.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader, and the circles with which I had previously seemed to have similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take a position that I would never agree with, whether it was national security or the EU's only market.
Every time I speak in public -- and no matter what I say -- this is followed by a series of attacks in social networks with calls for a renunciation, a conviction of the center's politics, and I'm told I shouldn't be in the labor party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know what's more fortunate than some of my colleges, because the comments I've received are usually political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who encounter daily streams of sexist or racist attacks, but never refuse.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Laborist Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a broad church, and with every movement of mistrust or change in the rules of selection, the party is shrinking.
Over the past two years, I've received a lot of advice, and I've been urged not to stand up, not to speak so loudly that I'm "everything's going well."
But that's not why I came to politics.
I joined the laborers 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because the lack of attention from the Tetcher government had caused my high school class to collapse, and since then I've wanted to improve the quality of government services for those who need them most, whether it's a local government adviser or a government minister.
I never hid my policy, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been puzzled by my political views and divisions with current leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday's events, I just want to say one thing: in conditions where a country is going to go to Brexit, which is going to damage the homes, businesses and government services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my allegiance to the leader of the Laborist Party.
In fact, I have another message, not for the Notingham Times, but for my campaigners, both members of the Labour Party, and none: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of revoking me and no political gain will prevent me from acting in accordance with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: the winners of Air rise up
The last two attempts may have caused some confusion in the end result, but there is no doubt that Air has earned a triumph in today's wonderful entertainment match by the Scottish Prime Minister.
Now they're leading the table, it's the only invincible team of ten.
Finally, the wonderful defence and improved ability to take advantage of the chances gives the landlord and coach Peter Merchi the full right to be satisfied.
"We've been through our games so far, and we're still invincible, so I have to be satisfied," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose comments, "I give due "Eir," they'd rather take advantage of the odds than we do."
Grant Anderson's attempt at 14 minutes, carried out by Frazier Climo, led Air forward, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, published by Verriors, allowed Melrose to show the numbers, and Jason Baggott used an unrealized attempt.
Climo enhanced the leadership of Air with a penalty and made and executed a solo attempt just before the break, which gave an account of 17-5 to the benefit of Air
But Melrose began a good start at the second half, and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, implemented by Buggot, reduced the break to five points.
Then there was a prolonged delay due to the serious injuries of Rhodeed Knott, who had been pulled out of the field on his load, and from the relaunching of Air came a front-running attempt by Stafford McDowell, which was carried out by Climo.
Captain Blair MacPherson then had a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another player to pay an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin under intense pressure.
The landlords came back, but when Strawan Hatchinson got a yellow card for intercepting Climo without a ball from the line of the penalty box, MacPherson made a touchdown behind the Moul Air.
Climo tried what he was doing almost every time after restarting, and then he got hit by David Armstrong in a box and sent a flunker to Gregor Henry at the fifth attempt of a team of landlords.
Seems like the "Already Game" star set up for a new career in the restaurant sphere
It seems that the "Already Game" star, Ford Kieran, has been set up for a new career in the hospitality industry, which can be concluded once it has become known that he is the director of a licensing restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor, Jack Jarvis, plays in a popular BBC TV series he writes to and shoots with an old comedy partner, Greg Hemfield.
Dwayne announced that the future nine series would be the last in the series, and it seemed that Kirnan was planning a life after Craigslist.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although the source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan wanted to enter the "prosperous restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": internal Bolivia hopes the court will open its way to the Pacific
Marines are pacing a well-equipped fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings are hanging an ocean-blue flag.
The seabases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with a motto: "The sea is our right.
We have to get it back."
In Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of a coastline that has gone back to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century over natural resources, as well as a desire to swim again in the Pacific.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades, because Bolivia is awaiting the verdict of the international court on October 1, after five years of trial.
"Bolivia has an impulse, a spirit of union and calm, and of course it looks forward to a positive result," said Roberto Calcassius, a Bolivian diplomatic.
Many Bolivians will observe the announcement of the MKJ's decision on large screens across the country, and they hope that the court in Haiti will take a decision in the interest of Bolivia, that after decades of disturbing conversations, Chile will be pressed for talks about giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his conversion the following year, also puts great hope in a decision to be announced on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in Bolivia's favour, and if that happens, little will change.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to condemn Chile and has observed that it will not determine the result of possible talks.
The fact that the ICC decision was made only six months after the final arguments were put forward suggests that the matter was “nothing” as explained by Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Bolivia's case has not progressed; for the last four years, it may have contributed to the rollback.
"The demand for access to the sea has been used by the present Bolivian administration," said Zarate.
Morales' war rhetoric blew up the remains of Chile's benevolentness, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not traded as ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Edouard Rodriguez Veltze, a representative of Bolivia in Haiti, disagreed that the court's approval was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will get "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relationship with Chile and a chance to put an end to the 139 years of differences by win-win," he said.
California also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political figure.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
This decree is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind."
North Korea says there won't be nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the US.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says that his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made during its loneliness in Singapore by the leaders of the opponent countries.
His comments appeared when US Superintendent Mike Pompeo seemed to be on the threshold of relaunching nuclear diplomatic activities, which had entered a deaf corner more than three months after the Singaporean alone with Kim Chen In.
Ri says that belief that the continuation of the sanctions and the United States' declaration of the end of the Korean War will once put North Korea on its knees is a "common dream."
Washington is afraid to accept a declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps to demolish.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously abandoning its armoury, which the country probably considers to be the only way to safeguard its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second alone between Kim and Trump.
At the Paris fashion shows, the latest trends of massive main decorations were presented, which is already heading on the main streets of your city
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely hide yourself from the sun, you've found what you need.
Valentino and Tom Brown's designers demonstrated a series of excentric basics in the style of the Opera from a spring-summer collection of 2019 on the occasion of the brilliant Paris fashion week.
Very impractical hats filled with Instagram this summer, and named designers have already sent their imaginary creations outside the spectrum.
Valentino turned out to be an extravagant beige hat with broad feathered fields that covered the models' heads.
Among the other anxes-executors were decorated with precious stones of coffee, the hat of the sorcerer and even the hat-anas, but they were not to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated an asphyxiation of original masks — very right in front of Haven.
Many of these colorful masks had their lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high fashion.
One of the creatures looked like an underwater float with a pipe and glasses, and the other looked like a crack of frozen ice that melted.
And if you support this serious fancy application, you're lucky.
Stylists say that huge hats can come out on the main streets of your city.
The Opera-Copellos have become fashionable thanks to the La Bomby, a straw hat with a width of six and a half inches [60 cm], which was seen on all, from Rianni to Emily Ratazhkowski.
The cultural brand, which lies behind a very impractical hat that could be seen everywhere in social networks, gave the world another creation: a strawbed beach bag of size almost as a model in a bathing suit that carried it.
A bag of yellow-red raffy with a rag of raffia and a white leather pen was the central element of a spring-sevent-year-old La Riviera collection of 2019 brands of Jacquemus on the Paris fashion week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armage told FEMAIL: "The coming summer I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of the city, because the designer's influence is so enormous that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for the oceanside.
John Edward: knowledge of languages is a duty to citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools maintain high standards of education, and in 2018 they again received excellent results of studies that complement individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
These schools, which teach over 30,000 students all over Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Board (SHED) and want to provide the best services for students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for the further and higher education they have chosen and to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personal school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Addison said, "If you speak a language that you understand, you understand it with your mind.
If you speak to her in her native language, she accepts it with her heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't use only English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year's studies, we see that in independent schools, languages are spoken in ratings of things with the best scores.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher A.
Data collected in 74 schools showed that 72 percent of the students had a higher A in Chinese, and 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish had also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages as a choice subject are now presented in the same way as NTIM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), independent school programs and other institutions.
A survey carried out by the British Jobs and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons why employers are unable to close vacancies due to a lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming more and more necessary in training young people for their future career.
Since more and more promising positions need to be taught languages, these skills are needed in a globalizing world.
No matter what career you've chosen, if someone has learned a second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifetime experience.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks several languages the advantage of competitors.
According to a survey of YouTube among over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a double percent (15 percent).
That's why investment in language teaching is now important to modern children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those in developing countries, will provide children with more opportunities to find full employment.
In Scotland, each school will learn their own languages.
A series of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to Britain from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child in independent schools, it will always be possible to choose several languages to study them with trained teachers.
Scotland's independent schools are trying to create an educational environment that prepares children and armes them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what their future is.
Now it can't be denied that in the international business environment languages continue to be vital to a future country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be considered “the habits of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to give this choice, variety, and perfection to Scottish youth.
Il faunt byen le fire.

LeBron debuts with the Lakers in San Diego
The fans who wanted to see the first launch of LeBron James for Los Angeles Lakers had almost arrived.
"Lakers" coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the first pre-season match against the "Denver Nuggets" in San Diego.
How many minutes he'll be playing, not yet decided.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers site.
Reporter Mike Ridell reported that James would rather play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of the Lakers pre-season.
"In this phase of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he answered.
Trump Mets in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of pre-election meetings today from the city of Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five Trump meetings scheduled for next week, including those in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidacy he had submitted to the Supreme Court had been postponed, and Trump was eager to form support for future mid-town elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of the Congres after voting in November.
What time will today's evening Trump's meeting in West Virginia take place, and how will you look at it on the Internet?
Trump's meeting in Wiling, West Virginia, scheduled for 19 hours Eastern today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can observe Trump's meeting in West Virginia online below on YouTube.
Trump probably mentions the strains of the hearing this week due to a candidate in the High Court of Justice, Britta Cavanaugh, who is accused of sexual harassment, and the postponement of the senator's vote for a week while the F.B.I. investigation continues.
But the main goal of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans gain popularity before the November elections.
President Trump's representatives stated that these five meetings next week were focused on “energizing volunteers and advocates, as the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” reports Reuters.
"Control of the Congres is so critical to its day-to-day order that the president will go to as many states as possible, as the tense pre-election campaign season draws near," said Reuters, a representative of the Trump campaign, who did not want to call his name.
At the Vesbanko Arena Stadium in Wiling City, today's meeting may be attended by followers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as by the media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's visit will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the last month, where he won over 40% of the votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate from the Republicans to the West Virginia Senator Patrick Morrisy, whose ratings are behind the polls.
“ It's not good for Morrisy that the president is coming to raise his ratings in the polls, ” remarked Reuters Simon Heder, a political scholar at the University of West Virginia.
Rider Cup 2018: The US team is set up to fight and is filled with hopes for Sunday singles
After three sessions, which ended with a one-sided victory, Saturday's Forces can be exactly what this Ryder Cup was missing.
The swing pendulum is a fully invented sports concept in which players really believe, especially in similar games.
So when do they say the pulse works?
"They were six points ahead, and now they're four, so I think we're taking it a little like a pulse," said Jordan Spit when he left.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spit says, feel a little wind in their windmills, and they're also encouraged by a lot, not the last time by the Spit and Justin Thomas, who were playing together all day, and each earns three out of four points.
Spit with his murdering blows from that little to the game shows an example.
These lazy screams of the celebration became louder when, in the course of his round, he made a decisive patch and balanced the score at the fourth match after he and Thomas had been two points behind.
His path, which allowed them to win a match on the 15th hole, met with a similar scream, which tells you that the American team doesn't seem.
"You really just have to try hard and worry about your own game," said Spit.
That's all each of these players left now.
18 holes to be known.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, are the irrefutable history of the Rider Cup.
It's unusual, but a beautiful couple from Europe has four out of four and can't make mistakes.
Molivud was the only couple who didn't make the gods on Saturday afternoon; they also managed to avoid the gods on Saturday morning and Friday afternoon and the nine last holes on Friday morning.
This run, and the way their energy seems to flow to this turbulent crowd and back, makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Fleetwood or Molinari to secure the potential victory of Europeans when the sun passes over Le Golf National.
Both are desirable at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about European triumphs.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had settled with Sergei Garcia, the hero of the morning foreballs, when he was in a relationship with Alex Norén.
One bogogo and two dabs on the first nine holes led the Spanish and Swedes to a hole they could never get out of.
Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It's very interesting to watch for balls and foresoms close by the interaction between the couple's members, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and it's interesting to see how policies can change at once.
Europe is now playing better than a team and has a great advantage in the last day, but this session of forsoms has also shown that the US team is going to fight, in which some, especially Americans, are doubting.
Europe leads with score 10-6 on the last day of the Rider Cup
On the closing day of the Rider Cup Europe will have a common advantage, for after Saturday's for balls and fores, it precedes the United States with a score of 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood's inspired duet and Francesco Molinari won two victories over Tiger Woods, and now on Le Golf National they have four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to restore the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in morning forkballs with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. was fighting more in forsoms and won two games, but could not reduce the breakup.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelty to win four consecutive points, while he and Mollinari (with the "Molliwood") after a sensational weekend are only the second pair who scored four points in the first four games in the history of the Rider Cup.
After breaking up Woods and Patrick Reed in forballs, they joined together to defeat the swelling Woods and the American novelty Bryson Deshambo with even more effective 5th.
Woods, who pulled out two games on Saturday, was showing random splashes of genius, but he now lost 19 of his 29 matches in forballs and fors and seven matches in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning trout, went back to Henrik Stanson's foresome partner to get a 2-to-one score from Dustin Johnston and Brook's Tipki, which is the first and third in the world's rating.
Europe couldn't do everything in its own way this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris.
The three main winners, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, set the standard for Americans on Saturday with their two points.
They won a decisive victory over the Spanish John Ram and Ian Poulter in the trout, and later beat Polter and Rorry MacLroy with a score of 4th and 3rd in the fores, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Rider Cup did the team return with a four-point deficient single, although Furick's team only needed nothing to save the trophy.
However, after the second place in two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it can't.
North Korea says that "never mind" will not be dismantled in a one-sided manner without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions would increase mistrust of the United States, and that under such circumstances the country would never be able to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho reported to the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had last year adopted “unavailable measures of goodwill” such as halting nuclear and missile testing, dismantled nuclear testing site and a duty not to spread nuclear weapons or nuclear technology.
"Well, we don't see the appropriate reaction from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will never be the first to dismantle in a one-sided manner."
And while Ri repeated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's “step-by-step” approach to deductification, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for its incremental steps, his statement was important because it did not reject the one-sided deductification that Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chen In and Donald Trump at the first in history between the real president of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim called on him to work on the “declaration of the Korean peninsula” and Trump promised a security guarantee to North Korea.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950–53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to weaken the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on "declaration at first" and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its goal forcefully, and even rejects "the end of the war," said Ri.
“Consider that sanctions can put us on our knees, the unfulfilled dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the extension of sanctions increases our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second alone between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader had stressed at the UN early in the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If South Korea, rather than the United States, were the party to the issue of deuclarization, the deuclarization of the Korean peninsula would not have gone into such a doubly corner."
However, the tone of Rio's speech was sharply different from that of the General Assembly when he told the General Assembly that the North Korean rocket launch on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after the “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “human rocket” who wanted to commit suicide.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “make up the whole” of North Korea, lauded Kim for his courage in taking action on disarmament, but said that much more needed to be done and that the sanctions should remain in effect until North Korea was deduced.
On Wednesday, Trump remarked that he did not set a time limit for it: "It will take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its steps.
However, US Secretator Mike Pompeo announced to the UN Security Council at Thursday: "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue energetically and unabatedly until we see a complete, final, confirmed declarification."
The Security Council has steadily increased its sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to block funding for nuclear programs and Ballistic rockets in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said that the next month he visited Pyongyang again to prepare for the second alone.
Pompeo had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July and remarked that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea convicted him of “gangster demands.”
During this month's meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to dismantle the rocket complex as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States is taking the “suitable steps”.
He said that, according to Kim, he needed the “adversarial arrangements” to guarantee the security that Trump had promised in Singapore and the steps to normalize the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest
The new course at Harvard University this year provided all of its students with more sleep, and it is an attempt to combat the growing culture of coolness of learning all night after filling up the coffee.
The teacher found that university students number one in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigam Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he thinks is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start a course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep-out on learning.
At the end one girl came up to him and said, "Why are they telling me this at the end of the course?"
"She said that no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," said a teacher from The Telegraph.
In the course that was first introduced this year, students are taught the basis for how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of mental health at Harvard Medical School and an assistant director of medical services at the University, said that the university had decided to introduce a course after it had been discovered that students had been seriously sleepless for a week.
Clockboard includes a series of interactive jobs.
In one section, there's an image of a room in a community, where students click cups of coffee, curtains, coaches and books to learn about the effects of coffee and light, the effect of sleep deficient on sports performances, and the importance of routines associated with sleep.
Another chapter tells participants how prolonged sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, the interactive icon map encourages the participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behaviour of students instantly.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Chesler.
A culture of pride for sleeplessness still exists, he added, and also pointed out that modern technology and growing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleeplessness is increasing.
A good sleep of good quality must be the student's “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even with a heavy weight, because sleep-freeness puts the brain into hunger, causing a constant physical hunger, he told.
So, a 19-year-old Californian researcher in chemical and physical biology, helped professor Chessler to develop a course after he joined one of his other courses last year during the first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all aspirants to attend a similar training program before coming to a competitive institution.
Professor Chesler recommends that students be reminded to go to bed and to set the alarm and to be aware of the negative effect of the blue light, which is emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, and which can interfere with the circulatory rhythm, causing problems with saturation.
Livingstone 1-0 Rangers: Mengo's goal upset Gerrard's boys
The Rangers experienced a queuing break-in of grief: Dolly Menga's strike led to a distinct team of Stephen Gerrard's defeat with a score of 1-0 from Livingstone.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first win at the match after the lute triumph over St. Johnston with a score of 4-1, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard a second win as manager of 18 games. Gerrard's team remained at eight points behind the Scottish Premiership Harts leaders.
Mengo scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, which was not inspired enough, didn't look like it could even the score.
Now, "Rengers have dropped to the sixth position, and Livingstone has climbed to the third position, and by the difference of the balls, they're only ahead of the Hibernian.
In addition, Rangers may have another disadvantage, as a lineman, Kalum Spence, was forced to treat the head wound after being thrown into the guest sector with an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that once passed through the Air in the halffinals of the Scottish League Cup.
And Holt released the same "Livy 11" component, which took one point to the Harts last week, and was fascinated by the way his wrinkled boys pressed the opponents at every point.
The Rangers may have been dominated by the ball, but Livingstone was more likely to work with the ball.
They were to kill in just two minutes of the game, when the first pass of Mengay into the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit the gates of Allan McGregor, but the half defender squandered this great chance by sending a ball over the gate.
Keahan Jacobs's deep free blow got to Skipper Craig Hallett, but his defence partner, Alan Litgo, hit the back of his trouser
Rangers did get control, but the last third had more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should be entitled to a penalty for a quarter of an hour after the encounter with Stephen Lawless, but the referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers managed to hit only two of the gates in the first half, but the former Ibrox gatekeeper, Limam Kelly, was hit with the head of Lassana Kulibali and a quiet strike by Oviet Jejaria almost didn't bother.
And while the 34 minutes beyond the Livingstone goal might have contradicted the pace of the game, no one can deny that they only earned it by their hard work.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' preparations.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who peacefully chose Mengoe for a simple end.
In the break, Gerrard replaced the Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the buffalo broke into Morellos, but the astonishing Kelly hurried out of his line to block it.
However, Livingston continued to force guests to play exactly the game they liked when Litau and Halletta took one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have improved the results at the last stage, but McGregor was well resisted by Jacobs before Litgo was hit out of the corner.
Glenn Middleton, replaced by the Rangers, made another late application for a fine when he encountered Jacobs, but Thompson looked back.
Almanac: Geiger's Inventor
And now our Sunday morning page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the time is coming... in Germany a future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm, Geiger, was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as Geiger's meter.
Since then, Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example in the 1950 "Call the Crown" film with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play doubtful cowboys.
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as Uranium.
When you put on those headphones, you can really hear how nuclear radioactivity affects minerals."
Evans: "Well, it's really cracking right now!"
The Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells that are part of the cure
The method is to remove the immune cells from the patient and change them in the laboratory.
Then these cells are able to "see" protein, which is common to many types of cancer, and then these cells are injecting the patient again.
Testing vaccines show promising results for patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman who had received a vaccine that taught the immune system to detect malignant cells, ovarian cancer had disappeared for over 18 months.
The method includes removing the cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can "see" common to many types of protein cancer (HER2), and continuing to reintroduce these cells to the patient.
Professor J. Berzofski of the United States National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, remarked: "Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine."
"HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorful cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which is to remove immunocells from patients and to “teach” them to target cancer cells, has worked to treat one of the types of leukemia.
Following the appearance of the SNL show at the MAGA baseball game, Kanye West held a sharp speech to support President Trump,
the negative reaction of the viewers
The audience of the SNL studio was taught by Kanye after his sad presentation, during which he commended US President Donald Trump and announced that he would be going for the presidency in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Down in a baseball cap, "Return America's Former Fame," he exploded with a tirade in which he criticized the democrats, and again declared his support for Trump.
"Perhaps during the conversation, the white people ask me, "How do you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if racism bothered me, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began with a sketch by Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star ridiculed the testimony of Britta Cavanaugh, which he gave to the Juridical Committee of the Sentence in the case of Christian Blazey Ford's sexual assault.
Although West's speech was not broadcast in the live air, a video of his tirade was broadcast on social media by Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to laugh at the West by posting this post.
West also complained to the audience that there was an unpleasant situation behind the squirrel because of the main cleaning.
As the Washington Examiner reports, West said, "When I was behind the squirrels, I was rudely treated.
I was told, "Don't go to the viewers in that baseball cap."
They bullied me!
And then they tell me that I'm in a place where the oppressed are silent."
West continued, "Do you want to see a place where the oppressed are silent? I'll put on my superman cap because so no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to keep moving?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to the Variety weekly, his comments at least twice caused a negative reaction of audiences in the hall, and the SNL actors seemed confused, and one of the audience said, "The studio is still quiet."
Westa was last asked to replace Arian Grande, whose former boyfriend, Reper McMiller, died a few days before the Ether.
The West caused many surprises by performing a song I Love it (I love it) in a costume of a bottle of Perrier water.
Westa was supported by the head of the TPUSA Conservative Organization, Kendez Turner, who wrote on Twitter, "One of the most polite:
Instead, the speaker of the talk show, Karen Gunther, wrote on Twitter that the West "is who he is, and that's just great."
"On the contrary, I won't reward him (buying his music or clothes or supporting his "mystery") who, in my opinion, practises and discards ideology that harms my community.
He's a free man.
Like us," she added.
Before the show's performance, a reper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name: he was now "the one formerly known as Kanye West."
West isn't the first artist to change his name, he's following the example of Grandpa, also known as Puff Grandpa, Puffy and Pi Grandpa.
Snoop Dog was formerly known as Snoop Lyon, and as we know, the music legend of the last decade, Prince changed the name to a symbol, and then became "Attist formerly known as Prince."
Charged for deliberately murder after a knife attack at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The police reported that the incident occurred at the Belligecamor restaurant.
The accused is expected to be tried by the Belfast Magistracy on Monday.
The prosecutor's office will look into the charges.
The star of the "The Gray of the Seeds" series, Keith Guerington, denies the idealization of bruteness.
Keith Guerington became famous for his role as a soldier with John Snow's sword in a violent middle-life fantasy series called "The Gray of thrones" produced by HBO.
However, a 31-year-old actor denounced the stereotype of a hero-macho, arguing that because of such heroes on screen, young boys often feel like they have to be cool enough to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, the whale said that he thought "something went wrong," and asked how to solve the problem of idealizing bruteness in the age of popularity of the hashtag #Meto (#too, #eve, etc.).
The whale, who recently married his companion on the Grey thrones, a 31-year-old actor, Rose Lesley, said that he was quite determined to deal with this problem.
"I'm now quite determined when we're on a slippery path to idealizing bruteness?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growing up from the perspective of the problem we see now?"
The whale believes that television is partly responsible for popularizing violence through images of extremely courageous heroes.
He went on to say, "What's natural, what's being planted?
Why does television and street teach that young boys feel pressure to be such men?
I think today's really important question is, "How do we change this?"
Because it's obvious that young boys are off the right track."
In an interview he also remarked that he would not shoot in any of the "Hearts of the thrones" and "Hearts of the thrones" sicwells after the end of the series next summer, because "he's already done with the battles and the horses."
Since November, the whale will play "The Real West" by Sem Shepard, the story of the film-producer and his burglar brother.
As the actor recently admitted, he considered the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best he had ever received from a series called "The Grave of the thrones."
"I met my wife after filming this series, so he gave me a future family and determined my life," said the Cat.
In a fantastic series that received the Emmy rewards, Rose played the game -- the love of the hero Gerington John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018, and the ceremony took place on the property of the Lesley family in Scotland.
HlV/AIDS: China reported a sharp increase of 14% in new cases
In China, a sharp increase of 14% in the number of people suffering from HIV/AIDS has been reported.
According to health authorities, there are more than 820,000 people in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases the disease was transmitted by sex, indicating a change in previous trends.
For a long time, in some parts of China, HlV was rapidly spread through infectious blood during transfusion.
However, according to official health officials during a conference held in Yunnan Province, the number of people affected by HlV has dropped to almost zero.
Compared to the previous year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The temporary sexual transmission of HlV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The declassification of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but LGBT society often suffers from discrimination.
According to studies, between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with other men marry women later because of the country's existence of conservatory values.
Most cases of transmission occur as a result of misuse of protection during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised to provide free access to medication from HlV, seeing as it partly solves the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leak of data from senators in the media by her full-time employee and criticizes dangerous lies and conspiracies.
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, convicted of a complaint that one of her employees had placed the personal data of three American senators in their Wikipedia pages.
The L.A. democracy claims that these statements spread "Ultra-rights" political viewers and websites.
"File, lies, and then even more hideous lies," Waters said in Twitter.
Reportedly, published information contained home addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lyndsey Grame of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch of Utah.
The data came online on Thursday, and they were placed by an unknown person from the Capitol during a hearing before a senate commission accused of sexual abuses committed against Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the office of judge of the U.S. Supreme Court.
Data leaked some time after three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
The Hill has reported that on such conservatory websites as Gateway Pundit and RedStat, information has emerged that the IP address of the source of the leak is linked to the Waters office and that it was possible to locate the data of its full-time employee.
"These unsubstantiated claims, absolutely untrue, do not match reality," said Waters.
"The part-time employee of my office, whose personal data and security are at risk as a result of these fake and false statements, has nothing to do with the outflow of this information.
These unsubstantiated statements are absolutely untrue; they are not true."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the network, among others by former White House Spokesman Ari Fleisher.
"This denial is filled with anger," wrote Fleisher.
"That suggests that with that character she cannot be a member of the Congregation.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, you need not be angry.
The accused must not behave shyly.
He should not ask for the motives of the accused.
He must remain calm and unstoppable."
It seems that Fleisher led the parallels between Waters' reaction and the Democratic criticism at the address of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is struggling to take Waters' place after the results of the inter-election elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"That's news, if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had already reported these false claims to "the responsible state and law-and-order bodies."
"We'll do our best to find the guilty," she went on, "and they're answering the law for their actions, which are dangerous and dangerous to all my employees."
A review of Johnnie English's Agent: New Mission, a follow-up parade for spy soldiers with Rowen Atkinson
It's already a good tradition to look into every new British film for the thought of Brexit, and they're also in the new part of a series of comedy games for the Johnny Inglish fighters, and the first film, "Johnnie Inglish," was released in 2003, and the series was relaunched later in 2011 with "Johnnie Inglish: Restarting".
Will the ridiculously ironic self-satisfaction of what we are wrong with the new export potential of the nation?
Anyway, Johnny Inglish, with his moving face and his glaring eyes, had the second opportunity to make a mess, with his name more than anything else indicating that this comic character was designed for audiences in non-English-speaking countries.
As we know, Johnny is a ridiculously cheerful secret agent, in which, despite his strange attempts to be gallant and charming, is a bit from Inspector Clouseau, a little from Mr. Beene, and a lot of things -- from the guy who played one note of the "Fire Wheels" film at the 2012 London Games opening ceremony.
The character is also pictured by an international traveler and puzzle that has always left behind the mess that Atkinson had played in a long-forgotten television advertisement by Barclaycard.
In the last film about Johnny Ingleish, there are a few beautiful moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Inglish, in his uniform, was approaching the helipopter, and his shovels were daylighting on his helm.
Atkinson's talent to set up a bouphonade is beautifully discovered in the film, but it's humorous, and in some respects it's too much, especially when compared to "serious" movies, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission Impossible," one of the "Ingredients" of which is also a comedy.
It seems to me that the jokes are more focused on children than on adults, and I don't seem as ingenious and thoughtful as atkinson's obsessions with Billie movies.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
The British super secret spy network is infiltrated by a hacker and uncovers the names of all field agents, which has become a total surprise to an active agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an essay role in the film).
This turned out to be the last crumb for the premier, a haughty person who has already experienced a devastating criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson has tried to convey the image of Theresa May, but the script has not been able to fully discover it).
She was informed by intelligence counsellors that all active agents were compromised and that she needed to involve one of the retired.
Choice falls on the awkward Johnny Inglish, who now works as a teacher in some super-mode school and informally teaches children to work under cover (in this part with the spy "year's school" in England there were a few good jokes for teenagers).
The Inglisha is quickly brought to Whitehall for a short-term buffoon, where he is reunited with his long-lived friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller for the next time.
Buff is now married to a captain of a submarine (the role of an exalted annoying person does not exactly match the talent of Vicky Pepperdin).
So, when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty went squeaky, the Batman and the robin are back in line and suddenly meet the fatal woman of Ophelia the Pistol, played by Olga Kurilenko.
And at this point, the prime minister comes under the spell of a charismatic billionaire who has earned his wealth in technology and technology and claims that he can fix the problem with the British network, the vile Jason Volt, who was played by Jake Lacey.
Inglish and Buff are going on a trip and re-entering their funny boots: dressed by waiters, they're setting fire in a fancy French restaurant; then they're sowing chaos by travelling abroad illegally on Volta's luxury boat; and the Inglish is making a real mess when he tries to use the helm of virtual reality to get acquainted with the planning of Volta's house.
All stops lead us to the last stage, but by their kindness and furiousness it is something like a movie for children.
A walk-through movie.
Like watching other Johnnie English movies, I asked myself the same question: Can't the British film industry offer Rowena Atkinson a role that actually matches his talent?
The laborers deny the preparation of a plan according to which the British will work four days a week, but will earn their wages in five days.
Jeremy Corbin's labor party has to discuss a radical plan, according to which the British will work four days a week, but get paid in five days.
It is reported that the party wants to require company managers to transfer money saved as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence to employees, giving them an extra weekend.
Thus, workers will have a three-day weekend and will bring home the same salary.
Sources report that this idea will respond to the party's economic agenda and direct the country's resources to support the working class.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved at the British Third Union Congress, and it is expected that workers will be able to benefit from a change in the global situation.
A source in the Laborist Party reported to The Sunday Times: "Policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
The labourers were not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week during the pre-election campaign of the year 2017.
However, not all members of the Laborist Party currently accept such a desire.
The Speaker of the Labour Party said, "The party's political program does not provide for a four-day working week, so we're not considering it now."
"The Shadow" chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at last week's pre-election meeting of the Labour Party.
Mr. MacDonnel said he was set to take back power from the "faceless directors" of the utilities and the "visiters."
The "shadow" plan also means that water companies' shareholders may not get all their share of the capital if the labour government introduces "counting" on the basis of perceived infringements.
He also confirmed his intention to include employees in company management and to create Inclusive Stockpiles to transfer 10% of the usual private sector shares to workers who are expected to receive a yearly manager of up to 500 pounds sterling.
Lyndsey Gray and John Cannedy are speaking on 60 Minutes, or can investigate the Cavanaugh case, which leads the F.B.I., change their opinion
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh, who is in charge of the Fed, the final vote for his appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court has been postponed at least a week, and the question arises whether the senators of the press will continue and continue to support Cavanaugh after the findings of the Bureau's investigation have been published.
On Sunday 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the senators John Cannedy and Lyndsey Graham if the F.B.I. could find something that would change their mind.
Candid seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Candid.
During the hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after everything happened and the charge came out, and I asked him, "Did you really do it?"
He was determined, firm, uncompromising."
It seems that Grayem's mind will not change anything.
"I think Kavanaugh's prosecution is a provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: "Britt firmly denied it," added Grey, referring to Christian Blazey Ford.
And everyone she calls can't prove it under oath.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't know what's going to change."
What is Global Citizen Festival and how can it affect poverty reduction?
On this Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, a yearly event in the music world with a staggering number of stars and an equally devastating mission to fight poverty around the world.
During the seventh festival, the Global Citizen Festival will crowd tens of thousands of people into the Great Gave of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but also to draw attention to the true purpose of the festival – the organisers want to overcome the extreme form of poverty by the year 1930.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global People Project, an international public organization, which hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for an event (unless you want to pay a VIP card), visitors have to do a series of jobs or "acts," such as taking lessons from a volunteer project, writing an email to a world leader, making a phone call or something to help attract attention to the organization's goal of putting an end to poverty.
So are there any results, since global civil society organizations have 12 years left to achieve their goal?
Is it really the idea of rewarding people for doing a free concert -- a genius way to convince people to do something, or is it just another case of what's called "clickivism," where people feel that something is really changing by signing an electronic petition or by making a Twitter publication?
According to the Global Citizen, since 2011, they have detected 19 million "acts" of their adherents focused on various goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to announce planned financial allocations and programs worth over $37 billion, which will help to change the lives of more than $2.25 billion by the year 1930.
At the beginning of 2018, the group gave an example of the results of its 390 financial and public statements, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
According to estimates by the group, some 649 million people around the world have been directly affected.
The Power of Nutrition, a foundation that is geographically associated with the United Kingdom, is one of the main financial responsibilities of the project. In the framework of the project, the investers and implementers undertook to "help children grow up" and pledged to provide Rwanda with 35 million dollars to help cope with the problem of undernutrition after they received more than 4700 Twitter messages from the Global Citizens.
"Because of the support of the government of the United Kingdom, mercenarism, governments of other countries, and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social problem of undernutrition a small fact of history," said a representative of The Power of Naturality Tracy Wallman, speaking to the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 "acts" that called for improved mother and child feeding, the government of the United Kingdom announced the allocation of funds for the Power of Nutrition project, which aims to improve the feeding of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen wrote, "It's a long and hard way, so sometimes we fall and we'll get hit by failure.
However, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we'll succeed because together we're stronger."
Janet Jackson, a group of The Weeknd, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, and Jianelle Mona are just part of the stars that will be playing this year at the New York festival, and they'll have Deborah-Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
The Minister of Internal Affairs stated that the US could use military-maritime forces for the block to prevent Russian energy from being exported.
According to a quote from the US Minister for Internal Affairs, Rayan Zinke, quoted at the Washington Examiner, Washington can "for the need" seek the help of the Navy to prevent Russian energy from coming out of markets, including the Middle East.
Linke argued that Russia's involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it works to invite a legitimate government, is a reason to explore new power sources.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to be an intermediary in the energy trade, as they are already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the manager, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"The U.S. Navy can provide free passage by sea routes and, if necessary, block them to prevent Russian energy from entering the market," he said.
Enque spoke to the members of the event, which was carried out by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that holds itself as the "voice of every consumer" in the United States.
He then compared the approach to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy effectively and replace it with alternatives," he said, calling Russia a "mutually developed" because its economy depends on mineral energy.
While Trump's administration was listening to reports or statements, it was intended to increase the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by removing Russian-based energy from the market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To that end, Trump's administrators and President Trump themselves are trying to persuade the German government to abandon the "missing" construction project of the North Stream 2, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 gas pool, which costs $11 billion, will double the capacity of the existing gas tank to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin convinces Washington that he stands up against the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of dishonest competition.
"In my opinion, we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and consumers should be able to choose the providers," said the Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak after meeting the US Energy Minister Rick Perry, who took place in Moscow in September.
The US position led to a negative reaction by Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading organization of the German Federal Union of the German industry (BDI) has called upon the US not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and the bipartisan arrangements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federal Union, after the last German chancellor, Angela Mercell, met Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Vorren will "might seriously think" of the 2020 President's trial.
A senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Vorren, announced on Saturday that he would seriously think about running for president after the inter-election.
During a meeting with the public in Goliac, Massachusetts, Vorrene confirmed that she was considering the possibility of standing.
According to The Hill Vorrene, "The women have to go to Washington and set up their government, and for that to happen, they have to have a woman in their head."
"After November 6th, I will seriously think about putting up my candidacy for President."
During her meeting with the public, Vorren expressed her appreciation for the presidency of Donald Trump, saying that he would "take his country in the wrong direction.
"I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Vorren was frank, criticizing Trump and offering him a candidacy as a judge of the Supreme Court, Britta Cavanaugh.
In Friday's Tweet, Warren wrote, "...of course, before the F.B.I. vote, it's time to conduct an investigation."
However, according to a Friday poll, most of Vorren's voters don't think it should work in 2020.
In line with the survey conducted by the University of Suffolk Center for Political Research and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of potential voters in the state of Massachusetts expressed their opposition to the senator's candidacy.
Thirty-two percent supported the solution.
The results of the survey showed that the former governor, Deval Patrick, had been receiving more support, and that 38 percent, against 48 percent, had been expressed for his potential Presidentship.
During discussions on the candidacy of other famous democrats, who may be struggling in 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders are also called.
According to Associated Press, Biden said he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions the PTSD of Tray Palin during a rally to support Donald Trump.
The 26-year-old track of Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son's going through right now, what he's going through after his return, can only be understood by other families that are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems with which our soldiers are returning home," she said before a rally to support the support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called Trac's arrest "a problem no one pays attention to" and said that her son and other war-veterans "come home the wrong way they used to be, and want to know if they respect what they've done here as soldiers, pilots, and other military officers for this country."
According to a reporter from the Wasillah police department, Dan Bennett, Trac was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as preventing a report of violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol abuse.
18 states and the district of Columbia support complaints about shelter policies
Eighteen states and a district of Columbia support a complaint against the new US policy, according to which victims of gang harassment and domestic violence are denied the status of a fugitive.
According to NBC News, officials from 18 states and districts sent an analytical note to the court's consultant in Washington to support a lender who needed shelter and complained about the policy in court.
The full name of the lender in the case of Grace v. Sechens, in response to the American Civil Rights Union, which complains of federal politics and which was filed in August, will not be solved.
The client stated that her partner "and his cruel son-in-laws" had beaten her, but the U.S. officials refused her when she asked for shelter on July 20.
It was illegally held in Texas.
Public prosecutors who support Grace's suit have said that the inhabitants of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (of whom refugees often request shelter in the United States) often face serious problems such as banditry and domestic violence.
The new policy of granting refugee status overturned the decision of the 2014 Migration Appeals Board, according to which immigrants without documents who had fled domestic violence could request shelter.
General Carl Reysin, the District Attorney-General of Columbia, stated during his Friday speech that the new policy “did ignore decades of state, federal and international laws”.
"Federal law requires that the decision to grant a status as a fugitive be based on a review of the facts and circumstances set forth in such a declaration, and the ban is contrary to this principle," is made in the analytical note by a counsellor to the court.
The prosecutor's analysis goes on to argue that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering the United States is damaging the economy because they can potentially become businessmen and "full the necessary labour resources."
The attorney-general Jeff Sechens issued an order to the immigration judges in June saying that they could no longer grant the status of a fugitive to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
"The shelter is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain public groups or political views," said Ceshnes during the presentation of politics on June 11.
Being sheltered never intended to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
The rescuers are desperately trying to find the survivors while the number of deaths in Pale has doubled
For survivors, the situation continues to worsen.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy down with a fever in the escape center of the destroyed city of Palau.
"Every minute quick help brings bodies.
There's not enough clean water."
Some people go back to their destroyed homes, take over the flooded effects, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals that have been damaged by an earthquake with an earthquake of 7.5 points on the Richter scale are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including two Geris with a broken back and shoulder, are resting near the building of the military hospital in Pale, where patients are assisted under the open air by constant redoing.
His eyes filled with tears when he remembered how a strong push shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to rescue.
I think I'm stuck in the middle of the walls," said Gerice to the correspondent, the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife beg for help, and then held quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador blames China for "executing psychological pressure" by using "advertising that contains propaganda."
A week after the Chinese national newspaper had published four pages of American daily advertisements about the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump of the past half-century paid for China Daily's Des Moins Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to influence the November 6th Congress elections.
According to Reuters, official officials in the United States reported that Trump's claims that he accused Beijing of attempting to intervene in American elections meant a new phase of escalation by Washington, whose goal was to pressure China.
While foreign governments can advertise to activate trade, there is an ongoing trade war between Beijing and Washington, where they have already raised the import toll.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the launching of a repressive flag in China was intended to strike exporters from such states as Iowa, who were supporting the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Brenstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of farm products to China, said that China had harmed American workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brenstead wrote in a column of Des Moins Register Sunday, "enhances pressure by publishing advertisements containing propaganda, in our independent press."
"In order to spread propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American people's tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press by placing a pay-as-you-go advertisement in Des Moines Register," wrote Brenstead.
"On the contrary, in the streets here in Beijing, you will find only individual voices of different sorts, and you will not see the true reflection of what the Chinese people really think of the direction of the development of the Chinese economy, which is disturbing, which is the conclusion that Chinese MlCs are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communistic Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the respectful Chinese editions offered to publish" his article, but did not name which one.
Analysts have warned that failure from Cavanaugh has led the Republicans to set up women voters against themselves before inter-elections.
Since many prominent Republicans support and defend a candidate for the post of judge of the Supreme Court of Britta Cavanaugh after having been accused of sexual harassment, analysts warn that this may cause an unwelcome reaction to future inter-election elections, especially in women.
This situation is engulfed by passion, and most Republicans publicly declare that they would like to vote.
These things can't just be played back," he said during an interview with The Hill, published on Saturday, by Grant Reger, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse.
Riger doubted that the investigation of the F.B.I., on which Senator Jeff Flake (responser from Arizona) had recently begun to insist, would suffice to calm the angry voters.
According to the newspaper "Washington, D.C.", the head counselor and lecturer of the advanced MoveOn group (Keep moving on) at Friday said, "The women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protesters sang "Fistopad approaching!" during a demonstration at the Juridical Committee, when the Republics decided to proceed with the confirmation of Cavanaugh's candidacy, despite Dr. Christian Blazey Ford's testimony.
In an interview with Stu Rotenberg's news website, a outside political observer, he said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"They say it is now, and it's true.
However, motivation may increase, especially in women who are 18 to 29 years of age, with predominances that have not yet been defined and often do not vote if they dislike the President."
Even before Ford gave evidence in connection with the prosecution of a Supreme Court judge for sexual crimes, analysts predicted a negative vote if the Republicans insisted on confirmation.
According to NBC News, earlier this week the former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steele, said, "This is a nasty story for the Republican Party."
As the U.S. Director of Prioritys USA (a group that helps the Democratic campaign) notes in an interview with the news channel, Guy Cécile, "it's not about voting a committee, voting a final vote, or how Cavanaugh got caught up on the charges, but how they responded and how they went on."
However, Americans' thoughts about who they believe, Ford or Cavanaugh, are divided, and Ford has a little more support.
According to a new YouTube poll, 41 percent of the respondents believe or rather believe in Ford's testimony, while Cavanaugh's testimony suggests that 35 percent believe or are more likely to believe.
In addition, 38 percent of those surveyed said that they thought Cavanaugh was giving, or rather giving, false evidence, while 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after his insistence on Flake, the F.B.I. will test the charges against Ford and another borrower, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week Ford gave a sworn witness to the senate's Juridical Committee about how Cavanaugh had attacked her while she was in a state of alcohol abuse when she was 17.
Ramírez stated that the candidate for the position of judge of the Supreme Court had shown her his genetics at a party during their studies at the University of Ille in the 1980s.
The Internet inventor plans to launch a "new Internet" to create a Google and Facebook competition
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the global Internet, is launching a new startup to create a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, the Inrupt company, is developing a platform with an open source Solid, the idea of which belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users can choose where to store data and who to access information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, the goal of Inrupt was "world rule."
"We must do it now," he said about the startup.
It's a historical moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable users to create a "personal online data repository" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of current cases, calendar, audio library and other tools for its own use and operation.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify at the same time.
The unique feature of this personal online repository is that it fully matches the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "the extension of personal capabilities using data."
According to the Director General of Inrupt, John Bruce, the company aims to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to make the Solid platform accessible to everyone.
The company is now composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought from IBM, a number of public developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programs.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team are not engaged in discussions with Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete replacement when all their business models experience fundamental changes within a short period of time.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Media Burners-Lee, Irupt's mission was "to provide commercial energy and eco-systems and to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful figure in the debate about online neutrality.
Even during the launch of the Inrupt Berners-Lee, he remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortia, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I look very optimisticly at the next age of network development," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vanne: Commemoration of the Church of the Order of the Church of Victoria during the First World War
The only member of the Church of England, who received the Order of the Church of Victoria for participating in the fighting during the First World War, is celebrated in his home town after 100 years.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann was rewarded for participating in the Battle of Belnglis and Leocourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he died four days later from a sniper's bullet and never found out that he had received the highest military reward in Britain.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren discovered a monumental stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire County.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vanne, called it "uniquely symbolic" that the discovery of the monumental stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandpa had carried out the feat for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vanne transferred his batalion through the St.
Later he hurried to the fire border and, with "excruciating bravery" led the line forward, before that one broke into the field cannon and destroyed three flames of an enemy subdivision.
Lt. Col. Vanna shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – a little over a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vanne said that his grandpa had done something he could never have repeated and that deserved respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vanne, laid the crown after the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Young Band.
Michael Vanne said that "he would feel very proud of taking part in this parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the respect that so many people show him."
The MMA fans hadn't slept all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they were shown "Peppu's Pig."
Imagine you don't sleep all night just to watch the Bellator 206 event and you're not allowed to view the main event.
There were 13 battles in the post office in San Jose, including six main programme elements, which were broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just before Gegard Musashi and Rory McDonald were ready to join the party, the United Kingdom television audience died of surprise when Pepp's pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting the battle.
Some spectators were not excited because they had not slept till morning, waiting for a fight.
One of the fans wrote in Twitter that switching to a children's cartoon seemed to him "some sort of bad joke."
"According to the government's decree of content broadcast at 6 a.m., it was not appropriate, so they had to let the child broadcast," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and public relations to Bellator, when asked for a TV broadcast,
Pepp's Pig, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, promised to work on the broadcast schedule in order to cover future audiences in the United Kingdom.
"I think that if we talk about repeating the broadcast, we can do it," said Coker.
"But now it's Sunday, 6:00 in the morning, and we can't do anything until we have Sunday and they're Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was shut down, we got a lot of messages we were replying to, and the text of those messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical failure, and we were trying to fix it.
However, it turns out that this was an incompatibility with government orders.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We were trying to redirect the signal to the fans, but we've stopped these attempts.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation
Tom Daly's olympian jump into the water said he was growing, feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him a reason to succeed.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that "not everyone looks like him" until he went to high school.
By taking part in the Desert Island Discs broadcast on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he said that he openly spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also stated that because of parenthood, he had become less concerned about winning the Games.
A longtime host, Kirsty Young, went to hospital for a few months.
When he came as a couple at the Laverne's first program, he said he felt "bader" than others as a child, because "the society doesn't take it when someone likes boys and girls."
He said, "To this time, the feeling of being less expensive and different was exactly what gave me the strength and strength to succeed."
According to him, he wanted to prove that something was "hard" in order not to disappoint all those who finally found out about his orientation.
The two-fold bronze olympics prize became a famous LBGT community rights champion and took advantage of this year's Commonwealth Games to encourage more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He stated that he spoke openly about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this hope to others.
A three-time champion of the world admitted that his feelings for the American film director Dustin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013, were a real surprise to him.
Dalei got along with the prize winner, the 20-year-old, last year, but, according to him, the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" (in the first games he performed at the age of 14 and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would also survive a similar fall and fall.
In June, a couple had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daly, and since then, according to Dale, his "world-wide perception" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd only think about getting gold," he said.
"You know, there are things much more important than the Olympic Gold Medals.
My olympian gold is Robby."
His son was named by his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said that his father could not accept the idea of the end and asked before he died if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, "you won't be sitting in the front row because you won't be around anymore," said Dalei.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daly took part in the 2012 Games and acquired a bronze.
"I knew that that was what I had dreamed of my whole life: diving in front of my countrymen at the Games of the Olympics, and there was no better feeling than that," said Dalei.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song, Proud, in the performance of Gyser Small, which resonated with him during his preparation for the Games and still summons ants.
The Desert Island Discs program is released on Sunday 4 at 11.15 p.m. in English summer time.
On Saturday, a tournament match for the Rider Cup led Michaelson, who was not in uniform
The American Phil Miquellson has set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game in the tournament for the Ryder Cup, but it has to re-establish the form so that this event will not be unhappy for him.
Michaelson, who had been participating in a tournament every two years for the record 12th time, pulled Captain Jim Furick out of the game while he was performing fortballs and forts.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, the five-time winner had been encouraging the team all day and was training on the side, hoping to learn emotions.
Since Mikkelson was not famous for being struck properly, even while he was in the peak of his career, a 48-year-old sportsman was not exactly suitable for a difficult golf course, Le Golf National, where a raft usually punishes for wandering blows.
And if that's not the case, on Sunday's 9th match, Michaelson will have to meet the champion of the Open Champion and the master of the exact strike by Francesco Molinari, who, together with the new Tommy Fleetwood, won all his matches this week.
If Americans who fall behind by three after 12 single games have a good start, the Michaelson game can be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his sportsman, and he probably had nothing to add except that.
"He fully understood his role today, shuddered me over the back, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furik.
"He has no doubt of his power.
Michaelson is a member of the Hall of Fame, who has done so much for the teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I predicted more games, but that's how it worked, so we decided to do it.
He wants to be there in the field like anybody else."
If Mikkelson goes out on Saturday, Nick Faldo's record will be broken, who played the highest number of games in the "Reider Cup" tournament.
He might be able to complete his career at the Cup of Ryder Tour, which never matched his individual achievements.
Michaelson's account is 18 wins, 20 defeats and 7 no results, but Furik said that his presence could play a decisive role for the team.
"He's funny, eaty, funny, he likes to joke with others, he's a guy who's great at having a team," Furik explained.
"I think the younger players had a good time driving on it, as well as this week, and it was interesting to observe.
He's more than just a player."
European Team Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big break doesn't solve anything
Thomas Bjorn, a European team captain, knows from experience that the feeling of a single match before the last day of the tournament for the Rider Cup has not yet guaranteed a victory.
Dutch debuted in 1997 in a game at the Walderram Club field, where the team led with Sev Ballesteros ahead of the Americans by five points, but won a match with a slight break with a score of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big break in a game at the Walderram field; a big break at the Brookline where we lost, and at the Walderram field where we were forced to win," said Bjorn after watching Class 2018 winning games with a score of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National Stadium, followed by a break of 10:6.
So history teaches me and every player in the team that nothing has been resolved yet.
Tomorrow we have to play with maximum return.
Go to the field and do whatever you need.
The game will only be finished after the result appears on the table.
We have the goal of getting this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said before, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are well aware of who is the best player in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a difficult field, Bjorn added, "I'll never run ahead.
Tomorrow things can work out differently.
They're expecting a personal match tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's cool to play field with a partner when things go well, but just when you're standing there alone, and you can check what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how to configure the players to perform tomorrow: at the limit of opportunity.
You leave your partner with no support, and now he has to show you what he's capable of."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposite number of Jim Furick is expected by his partners to play a better game at the individual level, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Up until Furik's last day, the fate was returned by various sides: he was among the winners in Brookline, but he was defeated when a team from Europe created "The Miracle in Medinus."
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, organized the players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, as was the case in Brookline and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone's side, players in the middle of the distance experience particular pressure.
We've properly positioned the players in the team, as if we're going to do something amazing tomorrow."
Thomas had been assigned to try to lead a counter-offensive in a top-match against Rhory MacElroy, and then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter were on the top half of the European team.
"These partners are the ones I chose in this order because I want to share the effort equally throughout the game," so Bjorn remarked on his choice of players at individual games.
The introduction of a new German battleship was re-entered
The latest German Navy frigate was due to take effect as early as 2014 instead of the obsolete battleships of the Cold War; however, according to the local media, this will not happen at least the following year due to an upheaval in systems and a rapid increase in costs.
According to the newspaper Die Seet, which was received from a military-repute agent, the introduction into operation of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the main ship of a series of modern frigates of the Baden-Wurtemberg class, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the rest of the fleet in 2014 but the problems that had occurred after the ship had prevented the implementation of the ambit project.
The four ships of the "Baden-Wurttemberg" class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are intended to replace the obsolete frigates of the "Bremen" class.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a set of anti-air and anti-ship rockets, and some technologies to reduce visibility, such as radiation, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is a long period of technical security, and it is expected that new frigates will not be able to return to the base port for about two years.
However, journalism Die Seet warns that due to the constant delay of the modern military ships, which were to increase the military strength of Germany in the sea, they will also become obsolete at the time of the invasion.
The numerous F125 frigate came under the headings of the Torik newspaper when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a ship was returned by a ship building company after delivery.
There is little information about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to the significant “software and hardware defects” which made the battleship unfit for military operations.
Shortcomings of software are particularly important because the ship of the Baden-Wurttemberg class is composed of about 120 sailors, which is only half the number of soldiers who served in the old Bremen class.
In addition, it turns out that the vessel has a considerable excess of weight, which worsens its exploitative performance and restricts opportunities for further upgrading.
The Rhineland-Palatinate frigate is believed to be twice as heavy (7000 tons) for ships of the same class used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Besides the mismatch of equipment, another problem has been the cumulative cost of the project, which also includes the cost of training the crew.
Expected 2.2 billion euros have become a huge 3.1 billion euros (US$ 3.6 billion).
Problems with getting new frigates have gained special weight in light of recent warnings about the fall of the German Navy.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, a member of the United States armed forces, reported that the Navy of the country “was left with a small number of ships suitable for military tasks”.
The official stated that the situation had been rapidly improving for some time, since older ships had been out of use and no new ones had arrived.
He said it was a deep pity that none of the Frigates of the Baden-Wurttemberg class could fill the Navy.
A national trust will observe the secret life of bats
A new study carried out on land ownership in Scotland is intended to determine how bats use landscapes to find food.
Scientists hope that the data received will help to shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals so that they can be saved in the future.
In the gardens of Invery in Wester Russia, scientists from the Scottish National Trust will observe species such as neopier dwarfs and netoper pygmies, as well as the orchards of the common and watery night.
Special loggers will be placed in strategic locations in the land area to monitor the behaviour of bats during the season.
Workers and volunteers from the Scottish National Trust will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
Expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and ownership of bat screams.
Then we plan to develop a detailed animal life map and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their environment.
Robot Dewar, a resource person for the protection of the environment in the national economy of Scotland, hopes that the results of the study will help to determine which areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to evaluate the effectiveness of care for the environment (e.g. the formation of grasslands) and determine how best to conserve forests for bats and other associated species.
During the last century, bat populations declined significantly in Scotland and in the United Kingdom.
They are threatened by the active construction and destruction of areas that rob them of their places of nesting.
Other negative factors include wind and lighting, adhesive fly paper, chemical processing of building materials, and home cat attacks.
The vocabulary is not actually blind.
However, hunting at night makes their ears more effective in catching prey than their eyes.
They use a sophisticated sonar method to detect insects and obstacles to flight trajectory.
In Scotland, a national waste of over 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of special importance and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, bats are taken seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, site checks, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts have even created the first and only Fleet Reservoir in Scotland, and it's located in the area of Trev in the area of Dumfris & Hallway, where eight of the ten species of bats living in Scotland were found.
The manager of David Thompson's office says it's the perfect place for them.
"In the area of the Premises there are wonderful conditions for bats," he assures us.
"There are old buildings, many huge trees, and other favourable living conditions.
But we still need to learn a lot about bats, and through the research we do here and elsewhere, we can learn more about what they need for prosperity."
It suggests that it is very important to test the area for bats before any technical work is done, because the unintentional destruction of one nest to produce youngsters can kill up to 400 females with children, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
Scissors and their nests are protected by law, and animals are prohibited from killing, tormenting or disturbing.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Fleet Center, called upon the public to join the organization.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we haven't discovered the characteristics of the populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects the charge of rape, and his lawyers prepare a complaint against the German publication
Cristian Ronald called the charges of rape a "smart" and said that people were "trying to draw attention to themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a complaint against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, in which suspicious information was published.
The American Catrin Majorga accused a forward of Portugal's collection and a soccer club called Juventus of being raped in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to the journal Der Spiegel on Friday, it seems that he paid her $375,000 for his silence.
A few hours after the charges were made, the 33-year-old Ronaldo turned to the 142 million of his fans in the Instagram video broadcast, calling the respective messages a "small."
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's charges are slander," a statement was made against the camera by the Golden Ball's five-time ruler.
"They want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to profit from me, but similar situations are part of my work.
I'm a happy man and I'm okay," added a soccer player smiling.
According to Reuters, the lawyers of the district prepare a suit against Der Spiegel for published charges, which they called "unacceptable report of suspicion in private life".
The lawyer, Christian Shertz, said that a football player would demand compensation for "moral damage in size, which corresponds to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most common cases of personal rights abuses in recent years."
It is alleged that the incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at the nightclub, Rolando and Majorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her; this is reported to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident, he fell on his knees in front of her and said he was on "99 percent good guy," who was thrown by "one percent."
As stated in the papers, he confirmed that he had sex with a model, but that he agreed to it.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and then to the hospital, where the injuries were photographed, but she later accepted the sentence, because she was afraid of revenge and was afraid of "public humiliation."
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel her previous marriage because she continues to suffer from an incident that she said had a place in.
At the time of the incident, he was preparing to go to the FC Real Madrid with the FC Manchester United, and this summer he became a player of the Grand Italian Football team, the Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will permanently damage the loss of automobile workers
The UK will be "long-lastingly hurt" if it loses the status of world leader in automobile industry after Brexit, and that's what's being warned by the secretary of the economy, Greg Clark.
He added that he was appalled by the statement made by Toyota UK officials, who informed BBC journalists that, in the case of British exit without a deal, the company would have to suspend the production and work of its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," assures Mr. Clarke.
The Japanese automobile worker argued that the effects of delay on the border in case of Brexit without a contract could cost jobs.
The Bernaston factory, which produces Toyota cars of the Auris and Avensis models, released about 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain exits the EU sharply at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, Director General of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other automobile workers, such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain's withdrawal from the EU will affect without an international trade agreement.
For example, BMW stated that a Mini factory in Oxford would be shut down a month after Brexit.
The main fears of auto-workers are that Brexit without a deal can cause risk to supply chains.
Toyota's production line functions in a state of rapid supply of parts and materials according to needs – details come every 37 minutes from providers in the United Kingdom and the European Union for the cars produced on demand.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there may be a loss of parts on the border, resulting in delay and a shortage of materials.
As the company says, the Toyota warehouse can place the parts for at least one day, so the production will have to stop.
Greg Clark remarked that in the organization's plan for a relationship with the EU, prepared by Theresa May (Cheques Plan), "exactly there are schemes for avoiding problems on the border."
"We need a deal; we need an optimist agreement that I think will not only be able to succeed at the moment, but also take advantage of the prospects that have emerged," he said during the Today program at BBC Radio 4.
"Because of Toyota's testimony as well as that of other automobile workers, we need to keep the formed high-quality supply chains."
The Toyota company has not been able to report how long production will be halted, but in the long run it is expected that an increase in costs will reduce the company's competitiveness and, as a result, will reduce jobs.
Peter Tsalaris, head of the United States trade union in Bernaston, who worked here for 24 years, reported that other participants were extremely concerned, "I can tell from experience that short jobs are not being restored."
A government official said, "We have put forth a precise and reliable plan to shape our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting can be postponed again, scheduled for the White House
According to White House officials on Sunday, the responsible meeting between the prosecutor-general, Mr. Rhode Rosenstein, and Mr. Dormouse Trump, and the assistant prosecutor-general, may be "repeat for another week" while discussions continue about the standing of the judge of the Supreme Court of Justice, Britta Cavanaugh.
Rosenstein controls the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's interference in elections, the relationship between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the potential interference with the President's justice.
For a few months in Washington, D.C., the possibility of the release of the prosecutor-general, which would compromise Mueller's independence, is being discussed.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about using microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending President's 25th revision.
Rosenstein did not support this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House on the background of reports that the official was about to retire.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations office in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump stated that he would not want to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was set aside to avoid a time-consuming meeting with the Juridical Committee of the Sentence where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment were to testify, Dr. Christiana Blazey Ford.
On Friday, Trump arranged to conduct a week-long investigation into the F.B.I. for charges against Cavanaugh, which added to the vote in the senate.
President Trump, Sarah Sanders, performed on Fox News Sunday.
When she asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date of the meeting is not set; perhaps this week it will take place, and I expect it to be set aside for another week, in view of all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I keep watching the press have the latest information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders did not hold a writ for the media in the White House since September 10.
The lecturer Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the infrequent conduct of the Brifings had nothing to do with the hate for public games by TV reporters, although she added, "I won't deny they're playing at the public."
Then she assumed that Trump himself would interact with the press more.
"The president answers questions more frequently than any president to him," she said, and she added, without referring to the source, "Statistics speaks for itself."
Sanders remarked that the brigs are still going to happen, but "if there's an opportunity in the press to ask the President of the United States a question, it's better than talking to me."
We try to communicate frequently with the press, which should have been particularly noticeable over the past few weeks, and the ability to talk to the President of the United States is no worse than the press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when outside the White House, open sessions or press conference for high-level guests.
Personal press conference is rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why this is so, being seen by journalists in a confused and sometimes bizarre way.
Scotland's state health secretary wrote to EU employees for fear of Brexit
The state secretary for health has sent letters to citizens of other EU countries working for the National Health Service in Scotland to express their appreciation for their work and to ask for it to continue after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already assumed the obligation to defray the costs of applying for permanent transfer status for EU citizens working in autonomous government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman remarked, "The summer went on talking between the United Kingdom and the European Union about the exit, and it's the fall that should wait for the appropriate decisions.
But the government of the United Kingdom is stepping up preparations for a possible exit without a deal.
I know this may be a very disturbing time for you.
That's why I want to stress again how much I value the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
All the European Union and non-European communities share valuable experiences and skills, building and improving health services for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay."
Christian Ebercrombie had a terminal operation after a head injury
The half-back of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christian Ebercrombie, had a terminal operation after having suffered a head injury in a Sunday match against the Vanderbilt Comodores, which his team had lost with account 31:27. This was reported by a journalist in Tennesseean.
The main coach of the Tennessee State Tigers team told reporters that the player had been injured shortly before the break.
"He came to the sideline where he got angry," said Red.
Afterwards, coaches and medical staff gave Ebercrombie a saturation before taking it on their shoulders for further testing.
An official of the Tennessee State Tigers team informed Chris Harris from the WSMV channel (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercrombie had been operating at the University of Wonderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "until there is evidence of the type and severity of the injury," the Tennessee State Tigers team is trying to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a second-year fellow, spent his first season in Tennessee State Tigers, following a transition from the Illinois team.
He did five catches of a ball on Sunday before he got out of the game, so he's got 18 intercepts in the season.
Alien purchasers will pay more government tomatoes if the UK is not moving.
Alien purchasers will pay more tomatoes if the UK is invincible. In line with Tory's new plans, extra costs will be spent on homeless people
This setting neutralizes all Corbin's attempts to involve young voters
The higher government toll will be drawn by those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The Ministry of Finance expected an extra £120 million a year to help homeless people
As Theresa May has announced today, foreigners who buy in the UK are going to pay more tomatoes, and they're going to spend extra money to help homeless people.
This can be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to involve young voters in promises to provide more accessible shelter targeted at highly paid workers.
An increase in the amount of money will be paid by natural and legal persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; additional government costs will help those who have to spend the night in the open sky.
An extra towel, accompanied by an increase in the prehistoric age to the second dwelling and the immobility intended for renting, may be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to attract an additional 120 million pounds per year.
According to researchers, 13% of the new immobility that is being built in London is becoming owned by foreign citizens, which increases prices and makes it difficult for people who just dream about their own lives.
Many rich parts of the country, particularly in the capital, are deserted, as large numbers of foreign customers live mostly outside the country.
The new plan of action came in just a few weeks after Boris Johnsson called for a reduction in the State to make shelter more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices for immobility by buying land without further use of it, and he urged Theresa May to give up the quota for available immobility in order to correct the "small position on the market of living" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin has announced a series of important reforms in the area of immobility, such as rent control and the failure to eject without good reason.
He also suggests extending the authority of the local council in the area of building a new dwelling.
Theresa May said, "I promised that I would dedicate my premiere to the restoration of the British dream -- for every new generation of life must be better.
This requires a change in our imperfect living market.
Britain will always remain open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, buy their homes under the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own dwelling has become impossible; the problem of living in the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "For the most part, I want to be the head coach of the Scottish Congregation."
Chief FC coach "Sanderland" Jack Ross claims that "most of all wants to" ever take over Scotland's collection.
A 42-year-old Scotsman went to rebuild the club from the northeast of the country, which is now ranked third in the First Football League, three points away from the leader.
Ross moved to St. Mary's Stadium of Light this summer, returning the last season of the St.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I went to the second collection in Scotland, but that's all over," Ross told me during the SportsOUND program at the BBC Scottland radio station.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the game of the assembled Scotland at Hampden Park Stadium."
The only hope for me is to be successful as head coach at the club."
Ross's FC fronts included Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardides, Martin O'Nill, Roy King, Gustavo Poetus, and Paulo Di Canio.
Former head coach of the FC "Hello Athletique" claims he didn't feel nervous about going to the big club following such authoritative names, precluding suggestions from the FC "Barnsley" and the "Ipsvy Town".
"In the current stage, I'll think I've made a success if the club returns to the Prime League.
Because of its structure and its material and technical security, this club is no doubt the same as the Prime Minister League," he remarked.
"It's not going to be an easy task, but the other result I'm unlikely to consider successful for myself."
Ross has been a coach for only three years, and he's been the second coach at the Dumbarton FC, and he's spent 15 months at the Harts coach office.
And then he helped "Hello" out after the FC got to the third division, and the next season from "St. Merren" went from the flight to the winners of the first division.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his career at the FC's "Clide," "Gartlpool," "Folkerk," "Saint-Mirren" and "Hamilton Academy".
"I'm at a crossroads," he mentions, talking about going to the FC "Hello."
"I sincerely believed that coaching was more appropriate to me than playing.
It sounds strange, because I've been successful, I've made good money on it, and I've reached a certain height.
But playing is very difficult.
There are many problems that you have to cope with every week.
I still encounter them with stress and stress, but as a coach, I feel at my place.
I've always been interested in coaching, and I've never felt as comfortable in my adult life as ever since I chose this profession."

Study: 5:30 a.m. Sunday is the perfect time for the beer kitchen
The summer heat has helped to increase the revenue of British pubs, which are experiencing bad times, but have increased pressure on the restaurant network.
In July, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, while the income of restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA, a business consulting organization, said, "Because of the sun weather and longer than expected, England's participation in the World Cup, July went through the same scheme as the previous month, when the revenue grew by 2.8 percent, and restaurants went on worse.
The red fall of 1.8 percent increased in July.
Pubs and bars focused on the supply of drinks, so far have the best scores: the increase in their income is the same as the loss of restaurants.
Pubs with food have also been affected by the heat, but not as much as restaurants.
Visitors seem to be interested only in drinks.
In controlled pubs and bars, the monthly sales of drinks increased by 6.6 percent, while food sales declined by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, an analyst of the Freedom and Hotel Department at RSM, said, "Such a tendency we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and large-scale social or sports events remain major factors affecting sales on the domestic market.
Not surprisingly, groups of restaurants continue to lose their revenue. An annual 4.8 percent drop in sales causes a particular concern about the need to reduce costs.
A long hot summer has not come at the best time for meal-giving institutions; let's see if the moderate temperature we saw in August can give them the necessary refreshment."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, in July was 2.7 per cent, reflecting a slower introduction of new brands.
A galouse indicator of the sales volume of the Comper Peach Tracker in the British pubs, bars and restaurants sector is a reflection of the collected and analyzed performance of 47 working groups with a cumulative trade volume of over 9 billion pounds sterling. This is a generally accepted industry standard.
Every fifth child has a hidden social network account.
According to the results of the study, every five children, sometimes under 11 years of age, have an account hidden from their parents and teachers on social networks.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictional pages in Instagram
This news has raised anxiety about possible sexual content
20 percent of the students reported having a "main account" shown to their parents
Every fifth child, sometimes under 11 years of age, creates a social media account that hides from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages in Instagram, a social network for the exchange of photos.
This news has raised concerns about possible sexual content.
20 percent of the students reported having a clean "main" account which is shown to their parents and one or more private students.
The mother, who accidentally came across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw the call for "rape me."
A study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools showed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles in social networks. Half of these children have recognized that an additional account is secret.
Mike Bukenan, the head of the HMC Association, said, "We are very concerned about the fact that many teenagers feel they want to create an online space where parents and teachers will not be able to find them."
Elide Doyle will become the "atleet's agent" in the Scotty Athletics council
Elide Doyle was elected to the Scotty Athletics Council as independent director during the annual general board of board members.
Doyle is a well-established Scottish athletic, and the head of the board, Yen Beatty, called this a great opportunity for those who lead the sporting movement to take advantage of its extensive experience gained at the international level during the last decade.
"Eylid enjoys great respect among Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that, by joining the board, Scotland's athletic sport will be of great benefit," said Beatty.
Doyle said, "Inspired to act as a member of the interests of the athletes, I hope I can actually benefit and contribute to the development of sports in Scotland."
The American, a four-time champion who won 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlantic Games, and now a BBC sports monitor, lost the opportunity to go through a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote to Twitter, "That's why I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show whether or not I could rebuild.
Thanks to incredible efforts, I have been able to rebuild completely, and I have learned to walk again, and I am doing dynamic exercises today!
Thank you for your words of support!"
In advertising the milk-sucker women were compared to cows -- the internet users' thoughts were separated
A milk-sucker manufacturer encountered a mixed reaction of Internet users to an advertisement that compares young mothers to active cows.
To mark the release of a product called the world's first quiet milk-sucker, Elvie's consumer engineering company published an advertisement in a humorist music video to show the freedom that a new sucker provides to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a blue-filled cow under a song that says, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have a tail," and "If you see it yourself, it's not a spell, it's my breast."
And then the chorus says, "Suck it, suck it up to feed the kids, suck it up, suck it off, so you don't waste milk."
However, the commercial published on the Facebook page of the company has caused a turbulent discussion online.
Videos received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments; however, the reaction of the Internet users has been mixed, and many have observed that advertisements underestimate the "horrible organization" of milk production in the industry.
"Not a very clever decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to milk, but their kids are being taken away from them a few days after birth," wrote one of the users.
Elvie milk-sucker can easily be hidden in a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment: "It's obvious that it's traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not involve them in advertising a milk-sucker for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone added, "These advertisements are far from reality."
And other users were trying to protect the commercial, and one of the women in the videos was "very cheerful."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would certainly have bought something like that if she were still breast-fed.
By sucking my milk, I felt really like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I didn't look for any hidden meaning in it.
It's a wonderful product," wrote someone.
Here's another comment: "A funny advertisement directed at moms who suck milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertisement is not intended to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show milk suckers hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women using similar products feel like cows.
However, the Elvie sucker works perfectly quietly, has no wires or pipes, and easily hides itself in a feeding bra, so that women can move freely, keep their children and even go outside.
Ana Balareen, a partner and creative director of the Mather advertising agency, said this to me: "The Elvie excrement is such a revolutionary product that it required a bright and provocative presentation.
After passing a parallel between women who cut milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the particulars of breast-feeding, in an exciting and interesting way, showing the incredible freedom that a new sucker would bring.
Elvie sucker is not the first time in the news headers.
Within the week of fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the occasion of this product during the presentation of clothes from the designer Martha Yakubowski.
Hundreds of children migrated quietly to a tent town on the border of Texas.
The number of children caught in migration has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossinges has remained relatively constant, partly because severe rhetoric and politics by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children in caretakers.
Traditionally, most of the caregivers have acted as immigrants themselves without documents, and now they are afraid to compromise their ability to remain in the country by offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when the government announced that potential caretakers and other adult members of their homes would be obliged to print their fingerprints and that the data would be handed over to the immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Alevens, a senior member of the Bureau of Migration and Control, witnessed to the Congres that members of the Bureau had arrested dozens of people who had applied to care for teenagers without accompanying them.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Around 80 percent of those who care for or are members of their homes are illegal in the country, many of whom are aliens who have committed crimes.
So we continue to persecute these people," said Mr. Alevens.
According to the shelter workers, in order to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of the children to appear in court within a month after being arrested, rather than 60 days after being arrested.
Many of them will be able to use video-conferencing instead of coming to court personally to assert their rightful standing before immigrants.
Those who do not have the right to shelter as a result of a court decision will be quickly removed.
According to shelter workers and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer the children are kept on guard, the more likely it is that they will experience anxiety or depression, which may cause violence or escape.
The advocates argue that these problems are growing in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where it is harder to monitor children's psychological state.
They added that by moving children to a tent town without giving them enough time to prepare themselves emotionally or to say good-bye to their friends, we risk increasing the injuries that many of them have suffered.
Syria ordered the United States, France and Turkey to immediately withdraw their forces.
In addition, in a speech to the UN General Assembly, foreign minister Walid Al-Mualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country had been in war for eight years.
Moualem, who also works as a substitute for the Prime Minister, said that foreign forces had been on Syrian soil illegally under the influence of counter-terrorism, so "the attitude towards them will be appropriate."
"They have to go immediately and don't make a deal," he said on the board.
Mualem insisted that "war against terror is actually over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we rid all Syrian areas" of terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has set up about 2,000 military officers in Syria, mostly teaching and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who speak against President Bashar Al-Assad.
In a war-stricken country, France sent over 1,000 soldiers.
With regard to refugees, Mualem assured that the country had created the right conditions for their return, and he accused "some Western countries" of "proliferating unfounded fears" which prevented refugees from returning.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to encourage people to come back," he said.
"We are witnessing an attempt to politicize a highly humanitarian problem."
The US and the European Union warn that they will not help Syria rebuild the country until a political agreement has been entered into between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
The U.N. diplomatic community will report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around Idlibu, the last large rebel cover, has created an opportunity for political talks to continue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale offensive by Syrian forces supported by Russia into a province where three million people live.
However, Mu'alem stressed that the deal had “smart terms” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including the Al-Qa'idah-affiliated Al-Nusra Front, who would be “destroyed.”
UN Embassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to call the first meeting of a new committee that will include government officials and opposition to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Mualem put forth conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that its work should be confined to a “review of the articles of the Constitution in force” and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be reconfigured
According to Trump's logic, it can be reconfigured in 2020 if, as likely to be expected by a lot of civil audiences, it doesn't form the authority long after scandal and impeachment.
No doubt it would be the "most dramatic conclusion of the presidency all the time"!
At the current moment, viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014 the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled (to 1.05 million) on CNN and has actually tripled (to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, in Fox News, an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the Rachel Madow Show program on the MSNBC cable channel was at the top of a rating of 3.5 million viewers in the evening when major news was being discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our comprehension," said Nil Bere, an ABC producer of the last candidate drama about the secretary of state, who becomes president after the fatal attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, an experienced Goumorist writer and author of the book "The only funny moments are, as well as some hard truths about the infiltration of Hollywood men," suggests another theory.
She remembered a trip to Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he's laughing at me," he said, "that's the story Mrs. Scowell told me.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, stories from Washington can determine the future of Rowe's case against Wade, the possibility of reuniting immigrants' families and the state of the world economy.
Avoidance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed by citizens when you've been watching a group of experts talk about Bob Woodward's use of "good familiar" sources for his book "The Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 suit of ostrich's skin ("the dress for the proud") and the effects of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy published by Storm Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the former.
"The reality of the show is partly related to the fact that you are being offered something new every night," remarked Brent Montgomery, the principal director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment company and the author of a TV program called "The Stars of the Pawnboard", about rotating in an actor's company and about daily plotting in the "Trump" show (conflict from NFL, supported by Kim Chen In).
If you let yourself skip one episode at a time, you can hopelessly stay behind.
When I met Mr. Fleis this week at his house on the north coast of Kauai Island, there was a warm sun weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not get rid of the TV, not when Britt Cavanaugh appeared before the Juridical Committee of the Senate, but the future of the Supreme Court had hung on its hair.
"Remember how we used to create all those crazy shows, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleis to me.
"I took it as a joke, but it looks like they were right."

External infusions into the most violent intermediate elections in the Congres
It's no wonder that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania there's extra money going on, because, by looking at the boundaries of the election districts, two of the right conventioners are running for one chair.
In the struggle for this parish district of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed, a democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lemb, has won a victory in another district in the additional elections of last spring.
The Lemb stands up to another valid Congressman, the Republican of Kit Roths, who now represents the State of Pennsylvania's 12th district, whose borders are very much the same as the new 17th.
The cards were rebuilt after the Pennsilvania High Court in January had approved a decision that the old borders of the districts were reserved for the benefit of the Republicans, contrary to the Constitution.
The pre-electoral race in the new 17th district led to severe opposition between the financial divisions of the main parties, the United States Democratic Party Committee for the Congres (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NCRCC).
The name Lemba became very famous in Pennsylvania after a victory with a minimal advantage in the 18th district during an additional election to the March Congres, which was widely publicized.
This place belonged to the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won a victory in this district, with a preference of 20 points.
Political experts have given little preference to the democrats.
In the United States, the possibility of imposing a penalty on El Salvador for support of China was considered, but changed
The academics were reminded of Washington's weak opposition to the Dominican Republic and Panama, which had previously supported Beijing's position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with President Pana, Juan Carlos Varela; earlier Trump had also had a hotel in Panama, until his partners removed the staff hired by Trump Organization.
The officials of the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of the diplomatic missions of the United States from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decision to reject Taiwan," announced the Spokesman for the department of Gezer Neuert earlier this month.
But the sanctions were addressed only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid in 2017, particularly in drug control and social and economic development support.
The proposed fines, which included a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this country of Central America, with its high levels of worklessness and murder.
Following the results of an internal government meeting in North and Central America, a conference was held at a high level dedicated to security and economic prosperity, and last year's analysis of the situation was seen as a step forward in efforts to contain the flow of migrations in the United States.
But by the middle of September, high-level officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and in fact, the discussion of the sanctions against El Salvador had stopped.
According to the diplomatic community, Vice President Mike Pence is now planning to speak at a conference scheduled for mid-July to indicate that the administration considers this to be a very important event.
At that time, three American senders returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, since there were no new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's representative in the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions that had been reported by three American officials, two of whom were diplomatic officials, on conditions of anonymity.
The information they provided was confirmed by a foreign analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on anonymous terms.

The next disadvantage may be a report by Special Public Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible interference with the trial by Trump, which is a strong confirmation of what can be found in the public information now available.
As part of his investigation, Mueller is said to be testing the possible link between Trump's campaign and our Russian voting system.
If the influence in the Congrees moves into other hands, Trump will have to report to the conventioners, just as he would to the voters and eventually to the same party.
There's a lot of "if anything," and I don't mean to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, just like his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that determines the duration of the struggle.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, if only the West would resist it and support the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We had failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodguilt.
The course of history is determined by such a turning point, and the uncontrollable movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now faced with a number of such breaking moments.
What are we going to do if Trump fires Rhode Rosenstein's attorney-general, the man on whom Mr. Mueller's fate depends?
Rosenstein was in trouble when this newspaper reported that he was offering to secretly record conversations with the President and to share his thoughts on Trump's incompatibility with office.
Rosenstein called the news in The Times incorrect.
"How will we react if the investigation against Britta Cavanaugh, recently launched by the F.B.I., proves not sufficiently careful or honest enough, or if Cavanaugh's candidacy for office before the Supreme Court is confirmed, despite the persuasive charges of sexual harassment and false witnessing?
And, above all, will we, in the medium term, vote for those members of the Congregation who will be able to take responsibility for Trump?
If we fail these trials, it will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-speaking Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial house.
She survived, imported to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light up the Saturday candles on the swastika table.
With such an inheritance, can I not look optimistically into the future?"

Grem Dorrans from Rangers is optimizing to meet the Vienna Rapid.
The FC Rangers accepts the Rapid on Thursday, and after an amazing thing in Spain in a game with the Villarreal at the beginning of this month's victory over the Austrians, the Scottish Club will offer a good chance of leaving the League of Europe G.
As a result of the injuries, the semi-entrepreneur Grem Dorrans was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in a match with the Villarreal, which ended with a 2:2 score. However, he believes that the FC Rangers can use this result as a stepping stone to achieve more.
"It was a good result for us, because "Vilarreal" is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out to play with the hope of getting something and got one point.
Perhaps at the end of the match we could go forward, but nothing in general could probably be considered a fair result.
In the first half, the adversary was a better one, but after the break, we corrected the situation for our own good.
On Thursday there will be another important opposition in the European League.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not going to be easy, and our future opponents have shown a good result in their last game, but we can rely on the support of the fans, and I'm sure we can give a fight and get a positive result.
The past year was certainly a difficult one, starting with my injuries and ending with the changes in the club itself, but now things are getting normal.
We've got a great setup, and all the boys are satisfied, and the exercises are going well.
I hope we can go on, leave behind last season and succeed."
Women have lost sleep because of the fear of retirement
Although the interviewees had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of themselves, few spoke to their family about it.
About half of the people who were involved in the Nationalwide study said they were talking to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of the interviewees talked about it with the kids.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't rush to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Division.
That's where you start.
Talk to your husband or wife and your children: your family will not be able to provide you with the care you need if you do not announce your wishes to your relatives in advance.
Consult with your counselor and your family to determine where and how to take care of them, as this may be an important factor in setting costs.
Call on a financial consultant to advise on how to cover the costs involved.
The sources of long - term care include traditional insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy, or self-sustaining self-sufficiency (as long as you have money).
Prepare the legal documents carefully: this will prevent legal dragging ahead of time.
Prepare trust for your representative, who will control your health care and make sure that experts do what you want if you cannot do it personally.
Moreover, we recommend that trust in the management of money be formalized.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills if you are not able.

In Ilfracoum, a man shot multiple times with a pneumatic rifle
The man shot several times with a pneumatic rifle when he came home from a party.
The 40-year-old victim was in Oxford Grove in Ilfracoum, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, stomach and arm.
The officers described the shooting which took place at 2:30 p.m. in British summertime as "random."
The victim did not see the assailant.
His wounds do not pose a threat to life, and the police are searching for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a massive earthquake and a Tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, reported by government officials, but the number of casualties may increase.
Because of the break-up of communications, officials working on humanitarian relief issues are unable to get any information from the Dongal Regent, a region north of Pale, which is nearing the epicentre of an earthquake with a magnetic score of 7.5.
After a disaster from Pale, 16,000 people were ejected.
Here are some basic facts about the city of Palau and the Dungal Regentship on the island of Sulavesi.
Palu is the capital of the Province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the West coast of Sulawes Island, with an estimated population of 379,800, according to the data for the year 2017.
When the earthquake caused by the tsoons occurred, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
The Dongala is a Regent that stretches over 300 miles (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the data for the year 2017, there are about 299,200 people living in the administrative district, located in the lower part of the country.
Fishing and farming are the main sectors of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coast of Donghal.
Nickel production is also important in the provinces, but mainly focused on the coast of Morave, the opposite coast of Sulaves.
According to the Indonesian disaster relief agency, in the past 100 years, Palau and Dongala have suffered from the Tsunamis several times.
In 1938 more than 200 people died as a result of the Dongala tsunami and hundreds of houses were destroyed.
In 1996 the tsunami also covered the western part of the Dongala, and then nine people died.
Indonesia is located in a seismic Pacific fire ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Below are a few of the largest earthquakes and tsoons in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a severe earthquake on the western coast of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsoon that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March, early in April, a series of massive earthquakes struck the West coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 points struck southern Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, and caused a tsoon that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra, there was an earthquake with a magnetic score of 7.7.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 points struck one of the islands of Mentawai near Sumatra and caused a tsoon of up to 10 meters, killing dozens of villages and killing some 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Regentship of Subjugia in Aceg Province, causing destruction and panic due to the fact that people have not been able to forget the devastating earthquake and the 2004 Tsunamis.
This time there was no tsunami, but over 100 people died under the rubble of the building.
2018: massive earthquakes struck Lombok Island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed countless houses, and thousands of tourists were unable to leave the island immediately.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for having been accused of domestic violence
The track of Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and the vice president's candidate, Sarah Palin, was arrested for the charge of assault.
According to a Saturday report from the state of Alaska, 29-year-old Palin of Wasilly, Alaska, arrested for suspicion of domestic violence and accused him of obstructing a report of violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a familiar woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took away her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is kept on guard in the Matanusca-Settlement inquest, with a 500-dollar charge.
He went to court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent" when asked if he confessed his guilt was reported online.
Palin is accused of three offences committed by class A, which presupposes arrest for a period of up to one year and a fine of 250,000 dollars.
He's also accused of class B abuses, which is punishable by a prison day and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that a criminal charge has been brought against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, as well as of preventing a report of domestic violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol abuse when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of warlords for justifying her son's cruel behaviour with post-trust stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, an earthquake caused a tsoon: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawes on Friday.
An earthquake of 7.5 gallons caused tsoons and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Communication and electricity networks have come out, and the number of victims can increase in the nearest days.
The earthquake occurred near the center of Sulawesi Island, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The video, which is spreading in social networks, shows the moment when the element hits.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palau when the tsunami landed on the shore.
Feds demand a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York
In New York City, the federal defendants demand the death penalty of Syfullo Sayipov, suspected of being in a New York attack, resulting in the death of eight people – a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, the 30-year-old Saïves was said to have been driving a rented pickup at Home Depot on a cycle track along the West Side, Lower Manhattan, and had begun to beat up the cyclists and pedestrians he encountered on his way.
In line with the report of the intention to kill in the South District of New York in order to justify the death penalty, the accused must prove that Saïves had deliberately killed eight people and had deliberately caused serious physical damage.
According to the judicial material, each of these counts of the charge presupposes the possibility of capital punishment.
A few weeks after the attack, the jury court charged Syipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for the purpose of demanding that the defendants usually press charges in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the accused, who described the crime committed by Saïp as "horrible, cruel and oppressive," this attack is the result of "genuine planning and early thought-out death."
The victims of the injuries, injuries or murders caused by Syfulla Habibullahevich Saipov were Diego Henrique Angelini, Nicholas Clèves, Anne-Lore Decadadt, Darren Drac, Ariel Erlich, Hernán Ferrucci, Ernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnecco, as described in the message of intent.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since, in the South District of New York, the last time a criminal case was committed, which is punishable by death.
The defendant, Khalid Burns, was found guilty of murdering two drug providers, and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty for a federal case was executed in New York in 1953, the married couple of Julians and Ethel Rosenbergs were executed after they had been convicted for conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were shot dead on the electric table on June 19, 1953.
According to the judicial materials of the Saïp, a native of Uzbekistan did not show a guilty conscience the following days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said to the investigators that he had no regrets about the incident.
According to the accused act of the Saïves, the authorities reported that he had been inspired to launch an attack on the video IDIL he was watching on his phone.
The police report that he also asked to hang the IDIL flag in his hospital room.
He did not plead guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the government's public advocates representing Sayipov, said they were "very disappointed" by this decision of procuracy.
"We believe that the decision to pursue the death penalty instead of admitting guilt and imposing a life sentence without a possibility of release will only increase the psychological damage caused by these events to all those affected," said Patton.
The Saipow party had also previously asked the accused not to seek the death penalty.
MP of the Conservative Party believes that NYJEL FARAJA should be appointed to be responsible for the Brexit talks.
Today, during a protest at the Conservative Party meeting, Richard Faraj promised to "mobilize the national army."
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party stated that politicians should “hear the pressure” of Europeans, as one of the members of Parliament, Theresa May, had offered his candidacy for talks with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bone, announced at a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "have come" if Mr. Faraj was the secretary of Brexit.
The fact that members of the Conservative Party, who opposed the exit, joined a special protest campaign in the city against Brexit further attracted May's attention in trying to reconcile their deeply divided rows.
The premier is trying to put into practice the compromise plan of Chequers, despite attacks by Brexit's followers, the opponents, and the EU.
The allies insist that it will not stop trying to settle with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and will force Europeans and labourers to choose between what it offers and "chaos."
At the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihal, Mr. Bone said he wanted to "reject from Chequers."
He suggested that Mr. Faraj step out of the shadows and take responsibility for the talks with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd be gone," he said.
MP Wellingboro added, "I'll support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers."
Addressing the EU, he said, "We have not fought in world wars to subdue.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the assumption that, after the vote in 2016, the public opinion had changed: "The idea that the British had changed their mind and were unwilling to come out of it is completely incompatible with reality."
A member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of Brexit, Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to reporters, "I'm just saying, "Premier Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it's not backed up by our party and our activists, who actually walk around the streets and fight for the votes of the voters.
Please discard the Chequers and start listening."
In her address to Theresa May, she added, "The Prime Minister keeps his office when they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians should be "under pressure" if they are going to refuse the decision taken at the referendum in 2016.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them they won't get away with it."
In a report to a enthusiastic crowd he added, "I want our political elite, who plans to betray Brexit, to feel pressure.
We are mobilising the nation's army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-conscious, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the opponents passed by Birmingham and then held a two-hour rally in the middle of the city.
A number of activists waved "Conservatives against Brexit" banners after starting the group with these weekends.
The labour lord Adonis made fun of the conservatories because security problems had emerged since the opening of the conference through their party program.
"These people tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies necessary for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he comments.
"It's a complete farce.
There's nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Worren's planning to "think seriously" about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Vorren said that after her November elections she would "think seriously about running for president."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday during the Western Massachusetts General Assembly, a representative of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about her future.
Worren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, runs in November for a second term against Jeff Diel, a member of the Republican Party, who was a co-head of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is seen as the main candidate that can fight Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon she had her 36th meeting with the general assembly elections since Trump took office.
The attendee asked her if she intended to take part in the election as president.
Warren replied that "it's time for women to go to Washington and set up government work, and for that to happen, there must be a woman in his head."
Arrested a suspected murderer with a firearm from a basketball player named LSU Tigers Sims
In Baton-Rose police, Louisiana, on Saturday, it was reported that a suspect was arrested on Friday by the LS-Tigers basketball player, Veid Sims, who was suspected of murder.
The Baton-Rose police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. in the east.
On Friday they published a video of a shooter asking for help to recognize the person on it.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot at Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wade Simms was shot in the head and died as a result," announced the 247sports police chief Murph J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade stepped up for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
The inquiry found that Simson was at the scene of the crime, had a gun with him, and had shot at Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton police station.
Simms, who was six feet and six inches tall and played in the Union League, grew up in Baton-Rose and played 32 games with 10 stars last season and averaged 17.4 minutes in the field, 5.6 points and 2.9 pick-ups.
Grand-Pri Russia: Louis Hamilton shortened the struggle for world championship after the team decided to give him victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the time that Walter Bottas left Louis Gemilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes command decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas had a good start with a poul-post and nearly passed through Gemilton, who was trying to keep his position on the first two turns and gave Fettel an opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fettel went to the Pit-stop first and left Gemilton on the trail in the tail of the race, which was about to solve everything.
The Mercedes team pilot drove another circle and went out behind Fettel, but Gemilton broke into leadership after a certain wheel-to-wheel manoeuvre, as a result of which Ferrari's driver reluctantly left the interior space because of the risk that it would be pressed after the double manoeuvre had managed to get forward at the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstoppen began from the back row of the net and remained at number seven until the end of the first round.
Then he led most of the race, because he did not change the tires to quickly come to the finish and put Kimy Riken out of fourth place.
In summary, he stopped at a plaster stop on his 44th lap, but could not increase the pace at the last eight, so Ricken sat down fourth place.
"It's a difficult day, because Walderry spent the whole weekend and showed honour when he gave me the opportunity to pass.
The team did an extraordinary job to have first and second place," said Hamilton.
The body language was not astonishing
At the meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein for her firm position that she did not announce the contents of a letter from Christian Blazey Ford, who accused a candidate before the High Court of Brett Cavanaugh of sexual violence.
During a speech at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly address Ford's presentation to the Juridical Committee of the Senate, but instead expressed his opinion on the events in the Senate, which he said demonstrated human "subordination, impropriety and lying."
"The only thing that could have happened, and all the wonderful things that have happened in the last few days in the senate, is anger, you see evil people showing vileness, vileness, and lying," he said.
"You're looking at the publications and the information they shared, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you share information?
Remember her answer... did you announce the contents of the documents? - "What?
Oh, no.
I didn't announce it."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July, Financial came up with a letter detailing the charges against Ford against Cavanaugh, and in early September its contents were released, but Finestein denied that the leak of information had occurred in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I didn't share the information I received from her," said the Financial Committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I didn't break my promise."
However, her opposition seemed to displease the President, who had comments during the Saturday meeting, "I'll tell you, her body language was not astonished at all.
She may not have done it, but I haven't seen anyone hold on to it."
Continuing to defend a candidate to the Supreme Court, whom three women had been accused of sexual violence, the President assumed that the democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power in any necessary way.
You see vileness, villainity, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to go through to gain power and control," mediaite quotes the president.
Elite League: Dundy Stars -- Belfast Giants, 5:3
Patrick Dwayne, the "Jants" player, dropped two pucks in a game against "Dunde."
"Dundy Stars" rehabed for a five-year defeat in the elite league of Belfast Giants, winning a 5-3 match and report on Saturday.
The "Jiants" won an early two-peak advantage thanks to Patrick Dwayne's and Francis Boville's rolls.
Mike Sallivan and Jordan Cooney levelled the score in a home match, and then Dwayne pulled the Jaiants back in.
The Dundee player, Francis Bouchard, compared the score, and the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nilsen secured their victory.
This is the third in the season of the Elite League to defeat the team of Adam Keef, who won a free victory over Dundee with a score of 2:1 on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting in the season, and three previous games were won by the Giants team.
Dwayne dropped the first puck for a quarter minute (3:35) after the transfer of Kendall McFall, and four minutes later Bovillet, who got the puck from David Rutherford, doubled the score.
After a strained first period of fourteen minutes (13:10), Sallivan returned the landlords to the game, and for sixteen minutes (15:16) Coney, after receiving a puck from Matt Markwardt, compared the score.
Dwayne had the advantage of the Giants before the first break, throwing his second puck at the end of the first period.
The landlords regrouped, and Bouchard rebalanced the score for a twenty-eight minute (27:37) by throwing a puck when his team numbered most.
Thanks to the efforts of Cooney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, for the first time brought Dundee forward and secured the victory of his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Giants team, which has already lost four of the last five games, will play a game against the Milton-Kines.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on a plane could avoid an earthquake
The flight controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he had helped to fly a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his life.
More than 800 people died and a lot of news was lost after a severe earthquake caused by the Tsunamis on the island of Sulawes on Friday.
Strong underground pushes continue to shake the area, and many people are trapped under the rubble in the city of Palau.
However, unlike his colleagues who had fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agun refused to leave his post in a highly dispersed tower at the airport of Mutiar SIS Al-Jufry in Palau.
He remained there to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, who was then on the landing strip, was safely raised into the air.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought it was going down.
He later died in the hospital.
Johns Sirite, a representative of the Indonesian Aeronautical Services Company, said that this decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We have prepared a helicopter from Blikpapan to Kalimantan, who is to deliver it to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We're very sorry to hear about it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of casualties can reach thousands, as the disaster relief agency claims that access to the towns of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is restricted.
"The number of victims can increase because many bodies are still under the rubble and many cannot be reached," said a representative of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves of six meters have devastated the city of Palau, where mass funerals will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes provide help and food.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News, "Every minute quick help brings the bodies.
There's not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are everywhere rife."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helfund, said to CNN, "The Red Cross of Indonesia is hurrying to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
President Joko Vitodo of Indonesia arrived in Pale on Sunday and asked the military officials of the country, "I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the tasks associated with the escape.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Earlier this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes on the island of Lomboc, which killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: As Air Niugini reported, after a plane fell into a lagoon one man disappeared without a message
The flight company, which had crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one person disappeared, although it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely ejected from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated that it was impossible to find one passenger on Saturday day.
The company reports that its agents are trying to find a husband and are working with local authorities, hospitals, and researchers to do so.
The flight company did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane fell on the water while attempting to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men had been taken to hospital.
The air company reported that six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the catastrophe and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The U.S. Air Company and Navy announced that the plane landed in a lagoon near the landing strip.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew the landing lane.
American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane flew very low above the ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes told me that he and others were able to get to the crash exits on a thin plane by the belt in the water.
He said that the stewardess were panicking and shouting, and that he was slightly injured in the head.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working near the modernisation of the wharf also helped in the rescue operation, bringing people to shore using an inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
In the past two decades, 111 people have died in plane crashes associated with registered PNG airlines, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
Analyst restored the chronology of the night on which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution committed a case against a man who was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rollett, gave evidence as an expert in the field of rapid development for a few hours.
He told the jury how he used the mobile phone records to play the movement of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night of the murder.
Rollett, according to The Clary Ledger, said that he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers that evening when she died, contrary to his previous statement.
When the data showed that his cell phone was near Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the latter.
On Saturday, Senford gave a witness and declared that he was not in the city.
When the defendants asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was at the Sanford Picape that night, Senford said he was "because my pickup was in Nashville."
Another incomprehension was that Tallis argued that he knew the Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rollett told me that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis, he had removed text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Gail.
The defender must put his closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
Trio hip-hop-prompter wants to challenge a negative view of the genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed group from Bristol claims that hip-hop has changed its nature – political ideas and struggles to solve social problems have gone away.
They want to go back to the outskirts and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugues and the Common recently witnessed the re-emerging of this direction in the United Kingdom thanks to groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
In New York, the nanny called for a couple's release, getting a "racist" message.
In New York, the nanny filed a couple for discriminating dismissal after she had received an incorrectly sent message from her mother complaining that she was another black woman.
The marriage denies that they're going to be racist, comparing the felony to "beating."
Lensie Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, who had come to work for her first day in 2016, was black.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she twice sent it to Mrs. Morris.
As reported by the New York Post, aware of her mistake, Mrs. Plaxson-Flaxman felt "uncomfortable" and released Mrs. Morris, she said that their previous African-American nanny was not doing her job well and that instead she was expecting a Philippine nanny.
Mrs. Morris was paid for one day of work, and then sent home to Uber.
Maurice now sues for a couple, hoping to get damages for being released in the amount of the payment she would have received in six months of living with the marriage to which she was first hired, though without a contract. She was to be paid $350 a day.
"I want to show them that you don't have to do this," she said to Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the accusation that they would become racist, the couple said that it was a wise decision to release Maurice because they feared they would not be able to trust her after the insult.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
We're not going to be angry," her husband, Joel Plasco, informed Post.
"But would you leave your children with a man who was treated rudely, even if it wasn't deliberately?
Your baby?
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Comparing the challenge with "extortion," Plasco said that his wife had only given birth two months ago and had "not yet settled."
"Would you have avenged someone after that?
It's a bad thing," added an investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has quickly convicted the couple on social networks, criticizing their behaviour and logic.
According to the new letter, the publishers of Padington feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear who could speak
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born almost immediately after the book was published, said about the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the position of the first reader before it was published.
Now it's funny, because we know about the huge success that Padington's story has made."
Telling her father, who was a BBC cameraman before the little toy bear inspired him to write a child's book, was optimistic that his work had been rejected, she shared, as on the 60th anniversary of the book's output at the same time, she felt "joy and sorrow," as the father died a year ago.
As for Padington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
"He was a rather modest man and didn't like to brag," she said.
"But Padington was as real to him as his own child! for when children reach something, we are proud of them, though it is not theirs, not our victory.
I think he looked at Padington's success exactly like that.
Although Padington is the creation of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say good-bye to her phone.
After landing, her daughter was hospitalized at the 2nd Louis Pastor hospital in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her life.
"On the phone regularly, he said it was really bad that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuse.
"And then over there called me and said she would die for the next two minutes and I should say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The doctors gave her the medicine to keep her heart beating and gradually stopped operating and left her body.
She died a while before everyone was shut down.
I should have just sat there and waited, knowing what was going on right now.
I couldn't get tired, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to really hold myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, who had suffered from the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers, ignoring the severe trials she had had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down and couldn't help the tears.
It was difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deeply compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered grief leave cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Gumfries leave cards on the Wallian Bridge with telephone numbers that people can call for support for, as well as messages that encourage them to inspire.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he took his own lives.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same as I do every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Sydney, said that her son was a promising cook with a pretty smile.
"Everyone knew him for smiling.
They always said that smile made any room lighter."
But he quit his job before he died, because he was "a word in the dark."
In 2014 Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother's body after he had laid his hands on himself.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always afraid it'll have consequences."
Mrs. Davis made the cards, so people knew there were people they could contact and talk to, even if it was just a friend.
Don't shut yourself up, you have to talk."
Mrs. Gumfries, who had been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost her 15-year-old husband, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed, that he was depressed or so," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed."
And on Christmas day, he was totally upset, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
She said that his death had become a huge wound to them, but they had to survive it, "It caused a devastating

Britta Cavanaugh's future is hanging out: the F.B.I. is starting an investigation.
"I thought that if we could get what we asked for -- limited in time and nature of the investigation -- we might have reached some agreement," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and added that he feared that the committee was "disrupting" in the background of the desperate loss of political party integrity.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his lobbyists want the F.B.I. to investigate?
Their misfortune is linked to time.
The mid-term elections will take place in just five weeks, November 6th, and if the Republicans are expected to experience problems, it will seriously complicate their efforts to hold their own people in the High Court of Justice.
George W. Bush called the senators asking for Mr. Cavanaugh's support, who was working at the White House for Mr. Bush's reign, and by virtue of which he met his wife, Ashleigh, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the fbi prepares its report?
In the senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and forty-nine democrats, there will be a vote.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Cavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes at the sitting of the senate, enabling Vice President Mike Pence to solve the problem with the same number of votes and to accept his candidacy as a judge of the Supreme Court.
During the reign of Kim, the number of North Korean combatants "have"
After Kim Chen Yin came to power seven years ago, the number of criminals from North Korea decreased to South Korea, declared by the South Korean lawmaker.
Park Pion Seugh, referring to the data of the South Korean United Republic, said that the number of criminals in the past year was 1127, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were the increased border control between North Korea and China, and that smugglers transporting illegals now demanded more money.
In Pyongyang, public comments were made.
The majority of North Korean combatants are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans were declared to have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views combatants as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forces them to re-establish them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still in a formal state of war, has improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed the issue of deductification, over which the talks had stalled.
This occurred after the June historical meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Ing in Singapore, where they agreed to work together on nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean foreign minister, Ri Yon-Ho, in the background of accepted sanctions, accused the United States of not having progress since then.
"With no confidence in the US, we can't be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no one-sided disarmament language," said Ri Yon-Ho in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nensi Pelosi calls Britta Cavanaugh "historical" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the judge of the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, "historical" and said that he was too temperate to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've always thought that if a woman had ever acted like that, she would have been called "historical," "Pelosi has been commenting on her reaction to Cavanaugh's testimony before the Juridical Committee of the Sentence on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied the charges of sexual violence against Dr. Christian Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introduction, Cavanaugh behaved very emotionally, sometimes almost shouted and turned around, talking to his family and school years.
He also publicly convicted the democrats in the committee, describing the charges against him as an "absumptuous and coordinated destruction of reputation," organized by the Liberians, who were angry that Gillary Clinton had lost the 2016 Presidential elections.
According to Pelosi, Cavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as it showed his bias towards the democrats.
"I think that with these statements, as well as with his speech against Clinton and the democrats, he will personally reclaim his candidacy," she said.
Pelosi was offended when she was asked whether she would try to announce Cavanaugh's impeachment if his guilt were confirmed, and whether the democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this: if he doesn't tell the truth to the Congres or the F.B.I., it's not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court where he works now," said Pelosi.
Cavanaugh is currently serving as a judge of the US Court of Appeal in Columbia County.
Pelosi added that as a democracy she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions against the "On Accessible Medical Care" Act or the "Row v. Weid" case, because he was considered a conservative judge.
At his hearing on the issue of confirmation at Cavanaugh's office, the question was whether he would cancel some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time when a judge will become a hysterical, biased person and we'll say how wonderful it is," said Pelosi.
Women must possess this weapon.
These were just words that had accumulated months and years of rage, and she could not utter them without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "One woman who was somewhere working as a principal, and she really helped me, said that she also cried when she was angry, but she had her own method, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to her fellow, "You can think that I'm sad and that's why I'm crying.
And I am angry."
And then she just went on.
I thought it was incredible."
Tears are considered to be a valid way out of anger, partly because they are perceived differently.
One of my most familiar memories of the first job in the office, where men were mostly employed, was that one time I was crying out of unspoken anger, and the older woman, an unwelcome manager that I was always afraid of, grabbed me by the cell and dragged me to the sunset cell.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know that you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad they've got you."
Patrice Schroeder, a then-democratic conventioner from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at the Presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught off-married on board a boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not go on the run for president.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said to me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and another one was the last thing they needed."
Someone called the situation "Sneeze and seven dwarves."
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she was behind in the fundraiser, so she made a promise that she would not take part in the race unless she saved $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her followers, who had no regrets for the support of men of $1,000, had only given her $250.
"They think I'll get a cut?" she wondered.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not hold an official campaign, she was embroiled by the gratitude of the people who supported it, the disappointment of the system, which made the collection of money very difficult and made it difficult to focus on the voters rather than the members of the House of MPs, and the anger of sexism, and she was ready to cry.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," mentions Mrs. Shredder's press reaction.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
Did I think about what they would write on my tombstone?
"She was crying?"
How the US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The experts believe that the first steps in the US-China trade war have been desperate, and, although far before it is over, the long-term perspective of the division between countries can benefit Beijing.
US President Donald Trump fired first warning shots earlier this year, taxing key Chinese export goods, such as solar, steel, and aluminum.
The biggest problem this week has been the new product fares of a total value of 200 billion pounds (150 billion pounds), which actually tax half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Peking paid back every single time with the same coin, recently putting a tomato in the size of five to ten percent on American goods for $60 billion.
China was obliged to take similar US measures, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to soon miss the opportunity to live up to that promise.
Making Washington retreat means accepting the demands, but for China's president, Xi Jingpin, the US's public worship is too shameful.
But, as experts believe, if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure in the US trade war can give China a long-term perspective, reducing the interaction of the two economies.
"A rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic fall in any one of the countries, and this is actually a greater threat than observers have previously recognized," said an analyst, Gabriel Grace, who deals with Asian-related issues at the Center for New American Security.
The foreign minister said that Syria was "prepared" for the return of the refugees.
In Syria, it is said that they are ready to voluntarily return refugees and are seeking help in rebuilding a country devastated by the war that lasted for over seven years.
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, foreign minister Walid Al-Moualem stated that conditions in the country were improving.
"The present reality has become more stable and secure because of the progress made in the fight against terror," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the terrorized areas so that people can get back to normal.
All conditions have now been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country which they have had to abandon because of terror, as well as one-sided economic measures that have affected their daily lives and restricted their means of existence.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Mualem stated that the Syrian government would gladly accept the help to rebuild a war-torn country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the riot.
Europe holds the victory for the Rider Cup in Paris
The European team won the Rider Cup in 2018, when it won the US team with a sum of 16.5:10.5 on Le Golf National in the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. team had lost six times in Europe and had not won the Cup of Ryder tour since 1993.
Europe returned the crown when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team drew 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mikkelson, who was trying hard for most of the tower, struck his first long-distance strike on the 16th hole of steam-3 into the water and passed on to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of the four players who had ever had a score of 5–0–0 since the start of a modern-style tour in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit lost a score of 5:4 from the lowest rating player in the European Turbierna Olesen team in Denmark.
Dustin Johnston, who is taking the first step in world ratings, went up with a 2:1 account for Jan Polter from England, who may have been participating in the "Rider's Cup" tournament the last time.
The Spanishman, Sergei Garcia, a Veteran of the Rider Cup, who had already taken part eight times in the tournament, became a European who had won most of the tournaments all along, bringing 25.5 points for his career.
"Of course I'm not crying, but I can't do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad, so glad to return the cup.
It's the team's credit, and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia, without holding back his emotions after winning Europe.
He's passing the essay to his landlord John Reem, who won the American golf legend of Tiger Woods on Sunday in a single game with a score of 2:1.
"I feel tremendous pride in winning against Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods lost all four games and now has a career record for the "Reider Cup" 13–21–3.
Amazing statistics for one of the most famous players of all time, who won 14 Major Tourners, only passed on to Jack Nicholas.
The U.S. assembly has been trying to get to the fairway zone all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Phinea, who have shown high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furick said about his team after a disconcerting speech, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we briefly dominated Europe.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off in front of Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, and I'm going to work with the United States Association of Professional Players and the Committee of the Rider Cup, and we're going to move forward.
I love those 12 guys and I'm proud that I'm their captain.
We should not fail to commend them.
We lost."
Current information on the red tide: decreasing concentration in the districts of Pinellas, Manat and Sarasota
The recent report of the Florida Commission on Fish and Nature shows a general decline in the level of red-coloured micro-organisms in some parts of the coast of Tampa.
According to the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife, the conditions of rich bloom reported in some areas of the district of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier show a decline in concentration.
The color of the red microorganisms stretches about 130 miles of the coastline from north to south of Li.
You can find some 10 miles off the coast of Hillsboro County, but less than last week.
The red tide was also observed in the district of Pascoe.
Last week, there were reports of an average concentration in the district of Pinellas and its coast, a concentration from low to high in the coast of Hillsboro, a high concentration in Manat County, a high concentration in the district of Sarasota and its coast zone, a middle concentration in the district of Charlotte, a high concentration in the county of Lee and its coast zone, and a low concentration in the district of the Collier.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier, they continue to report blowing breath.
No such messages were registered in the northwest of Florida last week.
