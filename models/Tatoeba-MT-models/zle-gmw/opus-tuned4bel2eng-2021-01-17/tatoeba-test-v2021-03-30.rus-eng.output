I can't explain it to you.
He's scared of dogs.
The party was full of girls.

Why does he hate me?
Stop teasing him.
He's known her since high school.
Tom pretended nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd quit smoking.
Stay here with them.
The accident almost cost him his life.
He cracked the bottle off.
We're home.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I disagreed.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you don't get me wrong.
Why are you so mysterious?
You're just running away from life's problems.
It's snowing outside.
When did you see her?

I knew Tom wasn't going to lose.
Tom told Mary he was thirsty.
Why are you smiling?
Tom didn't say how he was going to get there.
Didn't I tell you I'm allergic to peanuts?
I know how old you are.
I'll never show it to anybody again.

The results were shocking.
This room is empty.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
We're in Germany!
We were sleeping in the open.
Don't lock the door.

I have to go to work now.
Who is this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?
The smell is one of five senses.
What have you got?

Do your parents know about this?
The waitress put a white tablecloth on the table.
I stayed home that day because it rained.
Is there a pharmacy nearby?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.

We can discuss this later.
It's a bit helpful.
Cats in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.

But I don't have any money.
How did you like Mary's new dress?
There was fear on his face.
If you don't tell her, I will.
Can I trust you with a secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a singer.
Shall we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your fault.
Tom told everyone he was adopted.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Take her somewhere.
I was just there when it happened.
Her origin is unknown.
Smell it.

What were you and Tom doing after dinner?
I'm very unhappy.
As is often the case, Mike was late for a meeting this afternoon.

Tom wrinkled his nose.
I wouldn't be surprised.
I'm not lying.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want this to happen.
How much wine to buy?
I'm not going to do this.
He got in the car and drove away.
Tell Tom everything that happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.

Everybody but Tom has hats.
She gives him everything he wants.
Is this for sale?
I'm getting angry.
Do you have a bigger one?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
It only makes the problem worse.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of a flushed can in the toilet.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're gone.
Can I borrow your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jessie standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's some sugar in the bag.

Something very good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't get involved in other people's business.
Who's in the blue shirt?
Tom has an American accent.
I don't have the money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
Carrots are good for your eyesight.

His house is over the hill.
It was Sunday, and I didn't get up early.
How many pens!
Mary, are you all right now?
I made a mistake.
Do you want me to call them?
Tom made 20 pushes.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary slapped Tom, threw a glass of wine through him and stepped firmly out of the restaurant, there was a dead silence.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We recognized them.
Tom will paint the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you'll need a loan.

Is she your teacher?
Sing again, Tom.
What are you keeping from me?
Tom realizes he's no longer needed.
Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in pots in winter.
I speak French.
If that sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where you found it.
Tom should have told Mary.
Why is everybody staring at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you this would work.
It all seems so strange.
Tom decided to go.
You've taught me a lot.
What time do you wake up?
Take the trash out.

Tell Mary I have her keys.
Did you buy some candles?
Canada is the home of ice-hockey.
The brain is a very complex organ.

Where are the rest of the prisoners?
There's been so much going on today.
I saw a car hit a man.
We accepted their invitation.

I'm very happy right now.
My apartment was robbed last week.
How can you always be so energetic?
Place your signature here.
What an ego!

This soup is a fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He talks too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
You didn't know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to buy time.
I've already talked to Tom about it.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke in the dreadful, Jewish, Galilee dialect of the Aramaic language instead of Hebrew, thus demonstrating the impropriety of claims of the existence of any sacred language, whose use in prayers especially draws closer to God.
Finally, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is a little different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
So they paid $300 for it.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom's gonna do.
The weather forecast wasn't wrong.
Tom obviously doesn't know anybody.
I'll have Tom make you something to eat.
I'll go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.

And I'm very pleased to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I can't help Tom.
Is that my book?
Washing is routine work.
Who else is on your list?
Don't give Tom my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I wish I knew what to tell them.
Tom's kids must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you should talk to them.
He's reading physics in Oxford.
He kept it from me.

Someone said something, but I didn't figure it out.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I never worried about them.
Tom was able to get to the hospital on his own.
I sat next to Tom.
You sound upset.
Have you always been so selfish?
I think this drug will be of great use to you.
Tell Tom to be here by half three.
It's not God's news which science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it'll rain.
Would you like a beer?
Where did you see him?
The poor cat was on the brink of a hungry death.
I've learned so much from my mistakes, I think I'll do a few more!

Come here.

Tom won't ask me to do this.
I want to be like him.

The bus was full.
Where do you want to go next weekend?
How wonderful is that?
I'm hungover.
Tom wasn't polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car is a good salesman.
I have to work this weekend.
You can't do this to us.
His words puzzled me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what Tom had to do.
Say hi to her for me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer shocked everyone.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom back?
I've got to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it in the store.
The world is cruel.
I have a sensitive dream.
No one cares but himself.
I'm from Shizuoka.
Tom burned all the trees in his backyard.
Saturday is the day he's free.
I wonder what happened to her.
Last bus leaves in thirty minutes.
He told me he would do it.
He gave him a book.
Thank you so much for staying with me.
She gave me nothing.
I understand.
He wrote to his parents.
I'm happy with what I have.

Don't blame yourself.
What do you want to talk about?
Tom's yelling at Mary.
It's my favorite song.
Do not leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom used to say Mary was from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very perceptive.
Over and over in our lives are obstacles, some call them problems, others talk about opportunities for growth.
Thank you for taking him fishing.
You won't have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog barking in the woods.
He told me he wanted to quit the company.

Tom bought me a hot dog.
I'll be back late.
We need action, not words.

We sold our souls for money.
Are you working tonight?
The wind slammed.
I rarely met her.
I know it's really important.
I'm eating an apple.

I'm going to clean up your bedroom today.
He speaks five languages.

Among the kids in this class, there's no one as tall as Bill.
Shall we go?
I knew I could rely on you!
Tom put the firewood in.
"Love has never killed anybody." "Do you want to ask Romeo and Juliet?"
What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It looks like a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I shouldn't have let her go.
Tom died a year and a half ago.
I knew you'd come back.
These books are old.
Are we leaving yet?
Neither Tom nor Mary were ever in Boston.
Have you ever sucked?
If I had the money, I'd buy a computer.
Tom smiling?
She went to Paris.
Tom's at school now, right?
Let us know, please.
Tom nodded and went to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try proving I'm wrong.
I told you to stay in your room.
Do you have any pains?
He couldn't go because of a lack of money.
Let me explain how this works.
Open the door or we'll break it!
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't sell out French.
I think you can trust Tom.
There are many mysteries in life.
Isn't it too salt?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
This apple is rotten.
Tom said he didn't have any money.
Boston is Tom's favorite city.
It's a pity when someone dies.
Are you feeling better?
What makes you think that might interest us?
I'll think of you every day while I'm gone.
It was a bad bet.
The thought of her going alone bothered me.
The river flows smoothly.
He looks like Johnny Depp.
I watched them.
Do you really love her?
He gave a statement of the facts without comment.
He was dark green.
He'll certainly come.
Do you have a message?
Tom called me unexpectedly yesterday.
We really need this.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get some glasses.
I've decided to give up.
An accident took their only son.
Everybody knows there's something new in this old capital.
I'm always careful.

I'm proud of you.
She doesn't like my way of speaking.
Mary wants another baby.
I don't care what you do with your money.
I'd like to see the boss.
Tom didn't drive to Boston.
You can't rely on weather forecasts at all.
She's young.
Did you follow Tom's advice?

How's your father?
Did they say when?
This car looks angry.
Do you study English?
Are you my enemy?
She asked him for some money for a new dress.
Why does the moon glow at night?
I couldn't understand anything Tom was saying.

Tom did it on purpose.
Let's think about it.
I know Tom wants you to do it.
Tom said he didn't know anything about the robbery.
Do you know everyone here?
Tom couldn't read till he was 13.
I prefer quail eggs.
She lives in Muhosransk.
Those people that aren't smarter than I am, I'm not interested.
Is this your first trip to Australia?
Owls are wise.
Tom asked for some water.
The loser had a break in all three of his networks.

Which floor does Tom live on?
There are no direct flights to Bologna from here.
I live outside the city.
Give me a few hours.
Don't make yourself eat if you don't want to.
I have a job for Tom.
"How did the accident happen?" "No one knows."
What do you like about it?
When I arrived at the station, I called a friend of mine.
I need to buy a plane ticket to Moscow.
We met last week.
Do not believe anything he says.

We all knew it would happen sooner or later.
No one disagreed.

I fell asleep on his shoulder.
I know you work a lot.
I like Ural.
I hope you're wrong about that.
Sometimes you have to tell the truth.
Tom's a pusher.
I have a suggestion for you.
Did she enjoy dinner?
I think Tom was crying.
Tom and I are about to get married on October 20th.
If you want to be alone, I'll go.
He's got a lot of talent.
He's in a bad mood.
How would you like to be called?
He's got a Japanese father.
Who would want to kill him?
I was in a hurry.
He says he hasn't done anything illegal.
Tom said he was exhausted.
He's sitting up late in the night.
Tom's room is very small.
Do you speak Italian?
The girl smiled at me.
This song is doomed to success.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them what we could do.
I'm proud of him.
I just got home.
Tom burns both wood and coal in his stove.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We must be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom left Mary his keys.
I talk to him all the time.
I can't help laughing at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God foretold that Christ would combine royal power and clergy in Jesus.
Do you want me to talk to Tom myself?
Each of us went to his house.
The thread is thin, but it's strong and it doesn't break.
It's all a little silly.
I don't know what I want right now.
It's incredible.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six-five in favour of TV!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom's interested in biology.
She was trying to kill him.
Was he really that bad?
Tell me where you'll live, please.
They all need attention.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope nobody saw you come in here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we get Tom?
Tom said I was ugly.
Do you often cry?
We did not expect such results.
I've read it before.
If the car breaks down, we'll walk.
Can I touch your hair?
Did you find anything interesting?
Everybody's doing it.
I often visit relatives.
He'll be banished from our club.
You must be punished for what you did.
They went up the stairs.
She must drink water.
It's one of the most ugly buildings I've ever seen.
The burglar broke into the post office in broad daylight.
That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come too.
With God's help...
I don't like coffee too much.
My desk is old.
We're both very busy.
The darkness is impenetrable.
I get what I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll pick you up.
Tom tried to drown himself in the bathtub.
Tom and I are the same size.
I said good-bye.
Tom is Mary's younger brother.
You act like a fool.
Tom likes to play cards.
It's a big book.
Don't talk about Tom like that.
I kind of made myself clear.
We've been waiting for three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Times can change, but human nature is still the same.
Tom looks pretty upset.
I brought a cookie.
Next year Tom will be teaching French.
I listened to her till the end.
I told Tom to rest.
Why does that make you angry?
The worst part of the trip is over.
We'll miss both of you.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in the shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you do that!
I really needed that knife.
How do you know what I had?
It'll only take you a minute.
That's a situation I'd really like to change.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to trust any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a squirrel in a wheel.
He never got through it.
Would you like to come with us?
Does Tom know how to swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We're planning on leaving as soon as possible.
He went skiing in Hoccaido.
"Shut your fucking music and read the book." "I see my censorship spell still works!"
You knew her better than I did.
I've already talked to Tom about it.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no salvation for her.
I'm sorry I did this without you.
You're bleeding out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants what you want.
We can't just ignore it.
Where did you and Tom meet?
Where's the supermarket nearby?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you're lying, join us.
Tom wanted to ask Mary to apologize again.
Tom was thoughtful.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He was never there.
I really wish I could come with you, but I can't.
It's never happened before.
I wasn't going to do that.
I can't trust you.
I bought bread.
Let's hurry or you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary switched places.
How do they carry you out?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful man, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is at risk.
Mary made Alice a new dress.
That decision was difficult to make.
I thought you'd be thirsty.
I got what you asked me for.
He said he'd do it.
So you didn't have to go.
Mary recovered from her illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get this?
Eating meat harms your health and your environment.
Are you telling me you don't know anything about this?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom doesn't know how to enjoy life.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
Nobody likes me.
I wish I knew Tom's phone.
"Tom knows." "Yes?" "Did you tell him?" "No, he found out himself."
Your explanation was very clear.
I slept the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I'm just sure you've just been thinking about something dirty.
The Sahara is the world's largest source of dust.
What do you like most about Boston?
I want to be alone.
They were waiting for the signal to start.
I told them not to tell anybody.
We have a lot to buy.
I read an interesting book yesterday.
Tom will pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is a weeping owl.
I don't have that book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun lies in the center of the solar system.
Are you a policeman?
Tom failed both me and Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut myself with a razor.
Tom and Mary seem to be more than just friends.
The river irrigated the garden.
A strong wind quieted at night.
Ants and giraffes are distant relatives.
Tom did it because I told him that.
I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need him.
Tom carried two suitcases.
Tom didn't seem to recognize me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Don't slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I used to go to bed early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom's in the office.
All Tom does is watch TV.
Tom's in a good mood today.
It's the most delicious pears I've ever eaten.
I had a parking problem.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do that.
It's not mine.
Do you know what this is?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
Tom was never late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go ask your father.
Do you still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each sheet.
It's hard to take you seriously.
The members of this tribe settled along the river.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When's the beginning?
Nobody cares what she thinks.
I don't think it's weird.
"Where did you get my phone?" "Tom gave it."
When are you going to clean up the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Is there any reason to fix it?
Why are you locking the door?
Tom said he tried it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at 8 a.m.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You don't know how to write programs.
Change the subject.
I like to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom is small, but strong.
It's cold this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Can you find Tom, please?
He'll give it to you.
This sentence is not clear.
What would you do?
He disappeared in a crowd.
Don't you understand what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
Do you think you're fat?
Tom divorced Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is endless!
This box weighs a ton.
He gets it all because he's an ass.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he's never met her.
It seemed like he was going to kiss me.
Don't yell at me.
Are you having fun?
This is unlikely to happen.
I'll order it later.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
This is our school.
I've been free all day yesterday, and I've been working today.
Take your coat, it's cold today.
If you think about it, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose patience.
Why is Tom mad?
What a terrible man!
The cardboard is stronger than the paper.
Don't be mad at him.
You've exceeded your authority.
The curse was destroyed.
Tom's great-grandfather was born blind.
Tom's taller than you, right?
She hurt her back playing tennis.
Tom is easily frightened.
This table is white.
It was a strange game.
I've heard of all your problems.
I've known him for a year.
I'm going with you to Boston.
Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer they went to a mountain resort.
Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.
Tom and Mary are not afraid.
Can you come closer?
She's a little shy.
What do you expect Tom to do?
She seemed quite calm.
Press the button.
Tom went to the museum with Mary.
Tom was intrigued by what was happening.
Mary wore her boots to her knee.
That's a lie.
I'll follow them.
She said she had a cold.
The road inspector was extremely rude.
Tom wants to follow his father's footsteps.
I don't see a problem here.
I don't have to do this tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's awfully bitter.
Tom told you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on the way to work.
I don't know what you mean!
The last time Tom was the first.
Everybody's different.
I need to see you.
I lost your phone.
Plant the tree over there.
Do you usually wear a bike hat?
Tom will fix it.
Tom said good-bye to his sister.
The mother was busy cooking dinner.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
The little pots have long handles.
Tom was wearing sandals.
There's a bench under the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
How do you like my story?
Tom turned off the alarm and fell asleep again.
Tom and Mary looked tired.
I heard you sing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?
Tom often plays a Gitarre.
I was trying to warn Tom.
The train was full.
Tom rarely wears a tie.
You bought too much bread.
He says he's not planning on going.
I have two dogs, three cats and six chickens.
Does Tom have cable?
Whatever you say, I won't change my mind.
Tom can talk.
Thank him for his help.
Tom could have told me.
It'll bring trouble to your family.
I was very nervous.
Tom said I should go.
I have to win.
It's useless to ask him for help.
Mary was trying to sell her house.
You have to try not to sleep.
My mom's really helping me.
Tom's got a snake tattooed on his back.
You bought some meat at the supermarket?
He hit me by mistake.
What's that dog's name?
Walk on the pavement.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's father is.
It's raining like a bucket.
The whole country is talking about it.
I can't wait to tell him.
You can't buy happiness.
Tom grew up in a orphanage.
I don't want to watch this video.
The EU's poorest country is poorer than the US's poorest state?
Say hi to Tom from me.
I want to thank you for what you did for Tom.
I ran into a friend of mine.
Do you work with Tom?
They voted.
You're not the only one with the key to this door?
When did you ask her?
I remember Tom.

In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.

Mary was not thirsty.
It wasn't as hard to sleep as he thought.

Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom should be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll help you out.
We are proud of our achievement.
So I should have invited Mary.

The last few days have been very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to pour flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.

Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very talented and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.

Stand down, Sarge.
No one can do that.

To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want what's best.
Tom's a waiter.
It'll be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
Was it too easy?
What Alice had to deal with in waiting for an answer was a sudden swarm, it was a loud noise that was so sharp that it would tear off her drumsticks, and it was so loud to reach the sky.
I lost it in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
So you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get her stuff into the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did is wrong.
Many books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked him for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, aren't you?
We need to hire him.
I was trying vainly to solve the problem.
You were supposed to do your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom asleep?
If he does, he will respond.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tasted banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?

I told you I'd come back.
Tom's my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President has been in power for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have?
Can you settle that?
Both Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
There's 20 floors in the building.
If you're not going, I'm not going either.
Do you happen to know when Tom's coming back?
I don't have pictures of Tom.
Can you wait a little longer?
Are you going to give Tom something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would have been a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There's a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the courage to try jumping with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He runs as fast as you do.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time are you planning to be home at night?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's stubborn like an ass.
I think we can rely on you.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a feeling Mary was bringing her new boyfriend to a party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say it again!
I called him, but some girl picked up.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she would win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom's very hard on kids.
How are the talks going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got a little moustache.
Do you understand what she said?
You seem distracted.
Don't make her angry.
I'd rather stay.
So I came up with a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place secure?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and clean.
I suspect Tom has to go to Boston next week.
Don't walk in stranger's land.
Tom was horrifyingly watching.
Tom's face is red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stay?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done here.
How do you like your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
The hunger for him was an abstract notion; he always had enough food.
We need a new curtain in the hall.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her legs hurt.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important to both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do it often.
I hope we don't do this again.
How many times have you helped Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, there'll be an opening time.
I'm not sure what her size is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and went into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll drive as soon as it stops raining.
Thomas walked away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire it?
He and I were crying.
Would you like to try again?
Wait a little longer.
Why are you dressed like that?
You can make butter, cheese, and so on.
You don't have the power to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug a well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her little daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I've smoked before.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an innate guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won as expected.
He winked back.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
Have you thought about asking Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you speak that in human language?
Nobody's hungry except me.
Tom's very excited.
No snowflakes in the snowvale thinks it's their fault.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'll solve this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When does the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He widened his mouth.
It's a splash.
I really liked that book.
You're important.
When ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she would stay at her place for the night.
Tom didn't tell the police his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish is still raw.
Try to remain positive.
I was sick.
She suffocated him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Does it hurt?
The girl had a big red hat on.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was deceived.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who should Tom play with?
I need a light coat.
I've finished my job.
It's a cat.
Please tell me that's not true.
Aren't you coming in?
I repaired his radio.
That's a very bad idea.
Tom is taller than you.
Tom had no difficulty finding a job.
Is this book in public?
Please, can you speak up?
I'll tell Tom to contact Mary.
I helped them.
He looks like a girl.
Please contact me, no less than Jacob Matveyevich.
She's not alone anymore.
Tom never admits he's wrong because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
I've been to America before.
It took longer than I expected.
Mary stayed with her father.
I thought I could trust her.
Do you have Stevie Wonder's new album?
I was thrown out of my house because I didn't pay the rent.
Tell me where you went.
He stopped resisting and submitted to fate.
It happened on Park Street.
Eduardo is younger than Roberto.
The moon is a satellite of the Earth.
I don't know, go to bed!
There's nothing in nature that's useless.
No, she never fell in love.
You did it on purpose!
You won't need it.
Tom rarely goes to parties.
You're not my mother.
Tell them we're coming.
Do I look like a guy who wants to get married?
I locked the door, but I didn't lock it.
He should be careful not to kiss Mary in public.
Are we going to help them?
Thank you for calling me back.
They're happy.
Please don't be so hard on me.
Now I'm in charge of the parade!
People who are good to us all.
I'm not sorry for you.
I know Tom won't give up.
I don't really like her.
He's gone.
You're very smart.
Tom and I are about to get married on October 20th.
She thought I'd let her down.
I live in Boston now.
Tom took his secret to his grave.
You really want to put your money in that bank?
I don't think anybody else wants to do this.
We're teachers.
You must like me very much.
Why are you so worried about her?
I'll never do it again.
Do aliens exist?
Emily wants to be an electrician.
These books are better than those.
Don't try to remember every sentence in the text, it's almost impossible.
He's been studying French for eight years.
I thought it was you.
Personally, I think you're right.
I can't believe I did it after all.
The candle is burnt.
Why don't you get me something to drink?
We're collecting blankets for homeless people.
Tom paid Mary a very decent salary.
What do you think of that?
Let's eat breakfast soon.
Tom doesn't know why I didn't win.
Never in my life!
Did Tom ever ask you to help him?
The chair needs to be fixed.
I thought you were right.
Why is everybody looking at us?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did I say your name correctly?
No one saw her leave the room.
Wa-Bank.
Tom will never find him.
All women are the same.
He let them walk through the garden.
I don't have a crystal ball.
Your love is fake.
She's about my age.
Did you really do it for free?
Do you want me to open the box?
Boys will always be boys and girls will be girls.
You have to go to bed, turn off the radio.
There's nothing new about his addiction to alcohol.
He doesn't understand the risks.
That's why you don't have to do it anymore.
Do you have any idea who might have done this?
The teacher warned us that the exam would probably be difficult.
I'm a married man.
He bought his son a camera.
Shut up and eat.
I gave you everything.
I'm dedicating this song to you.
I like her better.
You're too young to know what a logarithmic ruler is.
I used to do it almost every day.
I'm deeply shocked.
About a billion people suffer from hunger and poverty.
I am pleased to inform you that your work has been accepted for publication in the SM.
I'm sure I'm right.
I didn't know you wanted to learn French.
Let's go home.
You have time.
I'm not coming.
Tom doesn't spend much time thinking about money.
So we have to go with Mary.
I wonder what Tom's doing here.
You're not powerful.
I don't think I can go any faster.
Tom had some questions left.
Are you looking for someone?
Tom's hand was bit by an ant.
So I didn't have to hide.
He'll be leaving the parents' house soon.
I don't think he'll hear us.
I want to go to England.
Have you seen anybody in the park?
Didn't I warn you not to go there?
Tom moved here from Australia three years ago.
She left Boston.
We must consider all options.
Tom could have killed me.
Grandpa Ali was a drummer.
Why didn't somebody tell us?
He's wearing his pajamas.
I went to find Tom in the lobby.
How old were you when you moved to Boston?
He's more or less aware of his problems.
Tom claimed to have seen UFOs.
I know who you were with.
Does Tom have a bike?
What did you ask them?
And the repair is good.
I eat breakfast every morning.
It's not a bug, it's a thing.
Are you having trouble with the car?
At the tourist information centre, a map of the city was made available to anyone who wanted to.
I'm sorry, but I can't.
Tom closed all the windows.
Come as soon as you can.
We're not hungry yet.
Learn Chinese not to impress your future boss, but to understand what she's saying.
You can add sentences that you can't translate yourself.
Mary's always home, right?
Just ignore Tom.
I don't think I'm biased.
I'm sorry, I didn't notice that.
I teach.
I knew Tom was bluffing.
I tried my best.
That's a good sign.
Some believe that they are protected by a guard angel.
Tom emptied his bank account.
She's at the hotel right now.
What do I get out of it?
He was so interested that he paid his attention to it.
I told him I wasn't interested.
Tom wants to change society.
I thought you couldn't see anything.
We're both here for the same reason.
Love is strong, money is stronger.
I saw him naked.
There's a lot of children's books in our library.
I didn't let her go home early.
Have you talked to her?
How long will it take to get there?
I didn't mean to disturb you.
We all wished each other luck.
Tom was born three days before Christmas in 2013.
The young girl was silent.
When Tom heard his favorite song on the radio, he couldn't help starting to sing.
When will this end?
Tom kissed Mary and apologized.
The stain that was extracted left a mark on the skirt.
Is Tom seeing anybody?
Tom showed me nothing.
I hate driving.
They're fake.
When you got back, I was gone.
Did you talk to him today?
I thought you stopped seeing him.
Tom's calling Mary.
She's watering flowers.
My wife calls me often when she goes abroad.
You're lying in bed.
First of all, I would like to make my position clear.
Tom knows how to play banjos.
Tom didn't decide what to do.
He doesn't like coffee.
Please turn on the radio.

The police can't arrest Tom.
How did you get into my room?
What do you want to give Tom?
We want to go to Australia.
I've got a very small salary.
Tom was pulled by a bear.
Tom knows where Mary's going.
You scared them.
Tell her to leave.
I don't know anything about that.
We've been dating for three months.
I'm glad you were there.
They gave me a big party.
This mountain is covered with snow all year.
Tom stopped by Mary's shop to buy sugar.
I like being red.
Stay out of here.
What's the worst movie you've ever seen?
I thought you hated us.
Think carefully before you answer.
Tom says Mary needs more time.
I took it for a joke and I didn't answer it.
Actually, his name wasn't Tom Jackson.
Is that sarcastic?
Don't do anything you'll be sorry for.
Are you jealous of her?
I hope I can stay here for a long time.
Payment will be based on experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to do sports.
Tom told me you were married.
I thought I wouldn't stay.
Looking forward to you and your family.
Did you change it?
I told you I changed my mind.
Why did you say that?
You have to work hard if you want to succeed.
There are no exceptions to Esperanto.
If you need help, tell me.
Can I go home early today?
You wouldn't have survived.
Tom didn't think Mary would be upset.
There's a commercial neighborhood nearby.
Mary thinks she's the smartest.
Use your fist.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I remember you.
That's interesting news.
Tom's a bitter drunk.
We don't even know her.
Tom came up with a couple of sentences and checked them out on Mary before putting them on Dadoeba.
I know where you're hiding your money.
The school is finally over.
It's a long pencil.
Does your mother know about this?
Do you really like that sort of food?
Tom looked in the mirror.
I told them not to tell anybody.
That's how Tom died.
The coffee shop is empty.
Write a pencil, please.
We can't leave.
He confessed to his crime.
It's the most beautiful painting I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
He's worried about something.
Sometimes she thought about psychoanalysis.
Tom would never agree to that.
You need to find a job.
He'll be back late today too.
She's very proud of herself.
I left about half a third.
Don't leave the tape in the sun.
I already knew that.
I watched them go.
I'm surprised you remember them.
Hey, I know you.
"Help! help!!" cried Pierrette.
Can I open the curtain?
You had no right to do that.
I'm yours.
He threw up exactly as much as he drank.
May the earth be of thee, Father!
Why are you still alone?
I want us to be friends with your sister.
Who were you waiting for yesterday?
Do you like to sing?
The road is slippery.
Tom's making breakfast.
Come in.
I save them for my grandchildren.
I heard that Carol and Will were separated.
What do you think of Tom?
Tom says he's never done it.
Tom seems like a nice man.
Help me find her.
Tom didn't give it to me.
I had to climb under the fence.
The firemen couldn't contain the flames.
Help has finally arrived.
It's a horse.
That's what happened here Monday.
America has ended its slave trade.
Don't you recognize him?
Fortunately, he didn't die in an accident.
He often sits for hours reading books.
I had no idea you could do that.
Tom unloaded the car.
Tom knew something about Mary that John didn't know.
No answer.
We need to call him.
Are you busy?
I shook my head negative.
Tom, there's a call for you.
You promised you wouldn't drink today.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Go see what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think that's how it works.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he was coming back.
What time are you coming tomorrow?
A box of holes.
Have you talked to Tom about this?
Is that a bat?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me what else I need to know.
You can't make me marry you.
It's rather odd.
The leaves are yellow.
I woke up and she wasn't here.
We have a lot of food today.
He gave a speech in which he supported my point of view.
Mount Kilimanjaro is a sleeping volcano located in Tanzania.
Why don't you go with her?
Why didn't you just tell them?
I can't rule it out.
Tom asked me why I never tried to get a driver's license.
I have to go back to Boston.
Have a seat, please.
Wake Tom up.
Here's a map.
You should have stayed with us.
Let's pretend we're aliens.
Tom said he wasn't hungry.
I have nothing to say to you.
I'd rather you didn't tell Tom about it.
I didn't want to go anyway.
I'm not going to complain.
They kept their love secret.
She only rushed to the station to miss the train.
Don't tell my fiancee that.
Tom's tired of always paying the bill when he and Mary go on a date.
I strongly recommend that you reconsider your decision.
I don't care about your past.
The police searched Tom's car.
Although I felt something strange, I didn't know what it was.
Are you a pig?
I joined the army.
Why can't you accept me as I am?
The bear is black.
Tom doesn't know what Mary did.
I don't know who's going to be at the meeting.
It's hard to approach the president.
If you're hungry, eat.
I was so scared.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll take care of it immediately.
I don't trust her.
Six three is eighteen.
"The Rock" is an anagram called "Laska".
I've never seen Tom help anybody.
Dan took part in a rally against racism.
You did it quickly.
I need to set the clock two minutes ahead.
He's on her side.
I haven't forgotten your betrayal.
I think you did great.
She danced so gracefully, she surprised us all.
This is where she worked as a secretary.
They're not that bad.
I thought I had everything.
Don't worry, it'll be okay.
It's hard for me to work with Tom.
I'm competitive.
He says his son can count to 100 now.
Something's wrong here.
Tom hates these things.
There's a little garden in front of my house.
Why didn't they go?
I heard you paid somebody to do it.
It's for my friend.
Tom said Mary was innocent.
The tulip is the official flower symbol of our prefecture.
I knew we'd be friends.
I didn't want to lose him.
She's at the hotel right now.
I'm going to give you some karate lessons.
Don't worry about my dog.
Tom's getting cremated tomorrow.
That's not true.
You're not allowed to do this anymore.
During summer vacations, tourists rushed to Karuidsawa.
I saw Tom get on the train.
He didn't do anything wrong.
She's wearing glasses.
I love this commercial.
It was just water.
I bought it for my sister.
I'll never forget how she and I went to Hawaii.
Nobody heard the call.
How did this get here?
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to fight.
I'd love to come with you, but I can't.
Shocked by the events of 11 September, politicians around the world condemned the terrorist for its reprehensible act.

I didn't want the same thing to happen to me.
I don't know all the students.
Thank you very much, you just ruined my life!

I'm sick of white.
Tom is a violent businessman.
I can't go Saturday.
We're getting married in October.
Tom and Mary disagree with you.
We'll see you soon.
Let's get a divorce.
There's no way he'll find the keys.
Her manner of speaking makes me nervous.
Eat what you like.
And then what happened?
Do you think he likes me?
Tom agreed to help Mary do it.
He prefers not to talk about it.
I let them sleep till noon.
I just wanted to get back to my old life.
Sorry I yelled at you.
I've already told you everything you need to know about this.
Health gives a man freedom that most people don't realize until he's lost.
Does it matter?
I know Tom's secret.
Tom is human.
That's ridiculous.
No one could believe it.
Tell her I'm fixing the fridge.
That's not surprising.
The rabbit's bleeding out of his ear.
Postmodernism is different from modernism.
I've already read this book.
God damn it!
He's very enthusiastic.
Maybe you should call the police.
Did you report this to the police?
Do you really think Tom's sick?
I'm not afraid of that at all.
I don't have as much money as you think.
I sell clothes online.
I could do things faster when I was younger.
I wasn't worried.
John, the tallest boy in our class, has a nickname called "Mr. Height."
Tom's leaving tomorrow morning.
I didn't kill them.
Do you recognize him?
I didn't really care.
Tom has a horse.
I shouldn't have come here.
Don't make such a sour face!
Is it white?
Tom came first.
There were strange rumors about them.
It's incredible.
The sky is covered with clouds.
This bird is threatened with extinction.
You're very pleased with her.
How are you?
Tom didn't look like he was having fun.
I'm fed up with everybody.
You said it was important.
He said he'd be back right now.
They have a lot of information.
Everyone in the village called her Green Hood.
I don't want to.
It's time to put the kids to bed.
It's a job you can get tired of.
I took a break.
Tom won't mind.
There's nothing.
I'm afraid you have no choice.
Did you take the medicine?
Many people believe in the corruption of our country's officials.
Did he put off his trousers?
I can't distinguish him from his brother.
We can count on him.
I'll go with her.
Did the phone wake you?
I really need to smack somebody.
I don't think Tom has any experience.
Come now.
Last winter I went to Canada to ski.
It's okay.
Tom says he can prove Mary didn't do it.
I was born on January 2, 1968.
I want you to stay away from Tom.
Tom just got out of prison.
The animals are allowed.
Tom's full of hope.
He speaks French as well as, of course, English.
Move that rock out of here, please.
"Tom's getting married." "And who's the happy choice?"
I've been thinking about you all day.
That's good news.
I can't pay you.
That's what I found in the cave.
I think I made an impression on him.
The train will stand at this station for about two minutes.
Grow up, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.
Where do you think the safest place would be?
I know your father.
I heard you shouting.
He's the boy who drew this painting.
"Call up" means calling.
Who would have noticed?
The drugs should be used only at the request of the doctor.
Do you have a question?
They went into the woods.
I talk too much.
You lead the way.
The sun shines brightly.
Coral reefs are full of life.
Tom said he knew what Mary was planning to do.
You never wanted to talk about it.
We hope for the best.
I didn't expect Tom and Mary to be here.
Last night, the temperature dropped below zero.
"You can't wear it." "Why not?"
Tom didn't do well.
I knew Tom wasn't in Australia.
My eyes are the ocean in which my dreams are reflected.
In a city as big as Tokyo, I prefer to walk rather than drive.
As it turns out here, it's impossible to find out now.
Now Tom has his own room.
I didn't recognize her first.
A lot of voices have been faked.
You lied to us, didn't you?
I don't think Tom can help you now.
He'll probably be here soon.
He had no idea what a differential equation was.
I know that for sure.
Grow up, Tom.
Can you distinguish Tom from his twin brother?
I don't get paid for it.
Tom ripped off the sex board with a crowbar.
Stay low.
How did you know where Tom was?
She says she'll do it on Monday.
Tom eats too fast.
The popularity of the phone has led to fewer people writing letters these days.
I think we're almost ready.
Wife came to our town three years ago.
Is that why you won't help us?
My puppy died, and I'm terribly upset.
She's taller than her sister.
I have a pink car.
So quiet.
The most beautiful flowers have the sharpest spikes.
You better hide.
Tom follows instructions.
It's just not going to happen.
They can't afford it.
What colors do you like?
She says she's feeling really tired.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom doesn't know how Iraq is different from Iran.
So they told me not to.
Two days ago, I caught a cold.
I was waiting for him.
You don't have to do this.
Let's have a coffee at that cafe or something.
You have something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom, he'll tell you the same thing.
He saw that helicopter himself and he started waving his hands.
I'm with you.
Do you want to end up like him?
I've been thinking about him.
I'm waiting for someone.
Are you going to the theatre tonight?
You have to protect yourself.
There's no air conditioner in my house.
Tom and Mary study French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his offer.
I admire your courage.
Tom hoped Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't make me do it again.
Soon it's your turn, Bashar!
You're talentless.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I went to Boston.
Excuse me, could you repeat the question?
What do you think they're gonna do to Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary does.
I don't want anyone to.
Tom will be working this weekend.
Tell her I called.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
The President's attempts to introduce stricter arms control were repeatedly interrupted by powerful weapons lobbys.
I think we know each other.
You underestimate Tom.
Don't bother Tom.
I'll try to put it in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
You have enough time.
We should have planned more carefully.
You need to sleep.
I'm proud my father is a good cook.
Is there anything else you want to tell me?
Thomas tried to explain Masha's situation.
I told her it was a mistake.
He's the manager.
Tom didn't have it.
Nobody paid any attention to me.
So it was thirteen at the time.
I'll take the bus to Boston.
Tom wants to try a new shampoo.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay ahead.
Have you made coffee?
You could have told the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually talk too fast.
We both speak French.
Find yourself a decent suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
That's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom concealed the fact that he was in prison.
We're for Spartak!
That's how he demonstrated his celebration.
Why did Tom need it?
It's a capital investment.
The truth is bitter.
There's not enough time for that.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
You promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
Network!
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there Monday.
I've read this before.
It's thanks to you.
As long as certain conditions are met.
She's not like everybody else.
Social networks allow you to find a lot of information about a person before you meet him.
What really happened last weekend in Boston?
What's the point of learning?
These peaches aren't very sweet.
I don't think these ink spots can be removed.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay.
I can't forgive his laziness.
Tell me you're joking!
I'm a realist.
I heard Tom got kicked out of school.
Tom said he was very lonely.
I didn't tell my friends I was going to Australia.
Kim is four years older than me.
Why aren't you in uniform?
Tom just wanted to make sure that that's what you meant.
Tom sent his daughter to bed without dinner.
I'm coming with you.
They cleared the street of the snow.
Tom and Mary should do it together.
They offered us their help.
Tom decided firmly to kiss Masha.
Are you very hungry?
What's going to happen to him?
Tom and I are good friends.
Where do you think you're going?
I had blood in my pee.
You can't always win.
Tom's kind of a celebrity.
Jimmy knows all about cars.
I've seen them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The painting hangs on the wall.
Mary said she'd win.
I want that dog.
Is Tom with you?
The boy is afraid of the dark.
I made Tom dinner.
Russia has become a second superpower.
I'm worried about them too.
He went to the post office to send a letter.
Spread that powder in a cup of water.
Will you go with her?
Let's take one of those ready-made dinners they sell at the train station.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
Do you want to go abroad?
Don't blame the government.
Put him in place.
How come you two know each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop the guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent in Manhattan is about four thousand dollars a month.
You won't find them.
Tom's the only one who survived.
Are you going to buy this car?
You sound like my grandmother.
I don't have any cousins.
Let's see something else.
Do you think this is an exact translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We were both very hungry.
That's why there's nothing to do here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.
You have to take his age into consideration.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you don't like pizza.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.
What if he comes back now?
If you're tired, sleep!
I'm afraid I won't have time.
You didn't know Mary was Tom's wife?
I have to go on.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
We're going to dinner on Friday.
What's your dad's name?
Will you turn the radio off?
I don't exactly remember what Tom said.
Tom's a good player.
I wasn't ready for that.
Look at that girl.
Tom has a living imagination.
He's got a broken neck.
What are you talking about?
Yesterday, you left the bar just as I was going to give everyone a drink at my expense.
Tom told me it was really working.
I want to play chess.
I support you a hundred percent.
I haven't seen you for almost three years.
You should tell her how you feel.
I have a slight headache.
I heard about what happened.
We rarely have snow here.
Do not open this box.
I hate waiting.
I see him at the club sometimes.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
It was fun yesterday.
Where did Tom get these photos?
It's useless to panic.
Hey, you know what?
I've been in Boston for three days.
I'm sure he's hiding something from us.
Tom knocked him down.
Tom tried to prevent Mary from opening the door.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You need to study more.
Only you can handle the money.
How does one have to do with the other?
I was able to do it a lot faster than Tom.
Don't feed the trolls.
Where did Tom sleep?
I won't tell you.
Why are you still here?
The equator divides the earth into two hemispheres.
He's a grounded man.
I've never seen anything like it.
The trees are a shadow.
She was taken in person.
Tom doesn't know where it is.
Tom doesn't know where Mary works.
I agreed with Tom.
I have so much to say.
The answer is "yes."
I think Tom wants you to do it.
Give me your new address.
Can you see me from there?
He told me.
Have you talked to Tom about this?
Tom lit a cigar.
It was snowing all night.
The book cost five dollars.

A letter to you.

When and where did you and Tom meet?
I've come to visit you.
I feel like an amoeboy.
Our team came home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom married an older girl.
I was listening to him.
Why aren't you asleep?
He came to you with a warranty?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you crying.
Show me how to do it!
Everybody's quiet.
Let the dust cool down.
Why are you so stubborn?
He fell in love with his Chinese teacher, but, with all that hormonal stuff, he fell in love with almost every other person.

I like the aquarel better than the pastel.
I can't make any exceptions.

I'm here now.

Don't stay too close to the TV.
I wash my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't pass the score.
Did you steal it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father likes fishing, like I do.

I like the color of your shirt.
It wasn't me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom's a better cook than I am.
He swims like an axe.
Tom didn't tell Mary what he needed to buy.
She brought the broom.
"Tom, hurry." "I'm coming!"
I have a big problem.
We're not partners.
We've had this problem before.
I'll try to speak it in French.
I'm not like everybody else.
I managed to get two concert tickets.
He likes to brag about his father's successful car business.
She's wearing sunglasses.
Come on, Emilia, your father is waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of a computer?
Tom can hardly walk.
Minus minus is positive.
There's a dead body in the cellar.
Please make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
There's nothing to tell.
I prefer to travel on my own.
It is the capital of Turkey.
I went to the bakery.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're great.
I spent the weekend with friends.
Jane's farewell speech really upset us.
I try not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look marvellous.
I appreciate your help.
He couldn't stop smiling.
Wait a minute, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is learning what you didn't even know you didn't know.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should have thought well before you made her pregnant.
Tom says he won't marry Mary.
I caught two fishes.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's pale.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is a friend of my father's.
Can I come too?
Does Tom earn enough to live in town?
The interview is over.
Please turn off the radio.
He did not seem to be sure of his answers.
I heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take off your jacket if you're warm.
There are so many.
He couldn't compromise his principles.
Mary says she's lonely.
It'll probably take you three hours.
It was an easy decision.
Mary said she'd be here early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Do you still buy lottery tickets?
It can be anyone.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's exactly what people don't understand.
Tom is gifted with a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
It's about telling the truth.
I don't want Tom singing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I didn't mean anything wrong.
Tom keeps his room clean.
These three books belong to Tom.
He jumped from one subject to another.
It's a truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's going in.
It's not cold today.
I put Tom's shirt on by mistake.
It looks like the bank robbery was planned up to the details.
That's why he didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.
Stay a little longer.
I want to talk to you about something.
The can is empty.
Why didn't you show it to Tom?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I was swimming in the river.
Tell them to pick up the phone.
Can you tell us what that is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's a butcher, right?
Don't make me kill you!
Which one do you like better, this one or that one?
They don't respect him.
No choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't make us angry.
You don't have to answer that.
Tom's got a lot of books.
Can you distinguish an alligator from a crocodile?
Wait, what is this?
My grandpa built this house.
Do you want to take this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a kid.
Do you really want me to tell Tom that you killed his father?
Your teacher called me.
I'm your father.
Can I do it myself?
The whole people were moved by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
May I take a shower in the morning?
All right, everybody, listen up, please.
Is it made of wood or of metal?
I'm sorry!
I think Tom is my friend.
As the nation hopes to remain ignorant and free, it looks to something that has never happened and will never happen.
Tom's barely breathing.

Tom poured water out of a bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are faithful animals.

I won't give you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be alone than in bad company.
That's the wrong data.
There's a remarkable difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom's lazy.
You have to tell Tom not to do that again.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's pretending.
Come closer.
We're staying at the Hilton Hotel.
So you should tell Mary the truth.
I'll be lonely after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She kept complaining that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
Something needs to be done.
She gave him a present.
Mary's in her room.
Attention, everyone!
That second I fell in love with that language.
Tom's safe, right?
Did you order this pizza?
I need you to help me with that.
Tom is a close friend of mine.
Don't do two things at the same time.
You shouldn't have gone into the woods alone.
No one sees my tears.
Tom's asleep again.
She likes you very much.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are repeated.
Tom's never kissed anybody before.
I'll tell them you came by.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
I almost forgot about the meeting.
They had a wedding last fall.
He's helping me.
Raise your hands!
Everybody knows we didn't.
I thought Tom had never been to Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five.

Honesty is one of the virtues.
As soon as you meet a new year, you'll spend it.
The library doesn't have any books in French.
Any generalization is dangerous, especially that sort of thing.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's nobody there.
Can you write that in a chiragon, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you like I do.
Behave yourself as old as you are.
Do you know how to juggle?
Did you kill your wife?
We had an exchange of greetings.

He took a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's depressing here.
Do you see a star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the rope!
That's what you used to say.
Tom says he's not hungry.
It's always been like that.
Can't we fire her?

I told them the bank wasn't working.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I'm very sorry for Tom.
There's nothing to tell me what to do.
The papers are on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know that.
Tom didn't tell us what he was so upset about.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I don't work today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it better than anybody.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
You have nothing to hide, don't you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The bill must be paid by the first number of the next month.
My French is awful.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
For me, Boston is a cold city, not like Chicago.
Tom was the victim of an attempted blackmail attempt.
I can't speak for colleagues.
Tom lives far from you?
Why didn't I die?
The argument ended in a fight.
I didn't take it, you can check your pockets.
Tom came in yesterday.
I'd like to leave a review.
You chose the wrong person.
They took a great risk.
We have a white cat.
Perhaps you'll never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home yesterday?
If anybody can do that, Tom.

Your problem is you don't have patience.
Several events marked the twenty-first century.
Stop doing that, Tom.
Tom said he didn't plan to do it.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told Tom to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said it couldn't be said.
He got out of bed.
Trains follow schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think it's impossible to get confused in languages.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Will the exam be today?
What motivates you?
Sami gave Leila his computer.
Roll your sleeves.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom would agree to meet us?
It's said that anybody in America can be president, but I guess that's not the case.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first one on the list is Tom's name.
What else have you missed?
Mary tried to calm down.
What time does the train arrive?
What time does this train arrive in Boston?
You didn't see that?
You need to call me.

When I get rich, I'll buy a farm.
I made him a cookie.
It's a neighbouring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe what Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think about it.
Translate this to French, please.
Eat the cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd was growing rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
It was Tom who told me what happened.
Cossie and kill.
I'll find her.
Have you thought about what I said?
I'm very sensitive to cold.
We're looking for you!
She's loved by everyone.
Compare your answers to Tom's.
Tom's heart is weak.
So he'll have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his overhead beard.
Have you seen my dog?
Don't even try to do it yourself.
No one saw you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to come back.
We've talked.
I can't believe I finally managed to do this.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry, the test is light.
Why don't you just tell me?
What's the 13th month?
I don't know which book to choose.
Tom didn't understand at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white chunky shirt.
It's a tower.
I'll have to wait.
It was Sunday yesterday, not Saturday.
Does anybody here know them?
They're watching you.
How long do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
We can do that.
He knows his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary's wearing a black dress.
We had dinner at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks for help.
Tom didn't tell Mary that.
It's okay.
There's a lot of wide ranges in this town.
What are you talking about?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find the hotel.
She's no stronger than I am.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't make people do that.
Let me carry it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I hate that color.
Do they sleep together?
We are very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still single.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
The neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I never spoke to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She's got shortcomings too.
I wonder why Tom would do that.
It seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing Friday night?
Tom isn't the only one from Boston here.
Will you back me up?
Why don't you like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
It's up to you to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture is a reminder of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter will soon be over.
The titles and rewards mean nothing to me.
Where did you even find him?
The meeting took a long time.
I recognize you.
Have you had a good day off?
Tom drinks beer.
If you don't want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Bring Tom a drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Concentrate!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we'll get lost.
I can't call him at home.
You should have apologized to Tom for your rude behaviour.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy ran to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a cab driver when he was living in Boston.
Tom looks optimistic.
He's not going to buy a camera.
I did everything I could to help Tom.
I'll connect you to her.
She's got the highest scores.
Tom can grow up.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color do you associate with your childhood?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the public.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom used the floor jack.
I'd like to lie down.
Lend me notes or something.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight.
He'll be here today.
The cat died.
It's only half past nine?

Tom doesn't know I exist.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Is Lori home?
I've decided to marry Tom.
I'll never make that mistake again.
I don't care if we stay.
I convinced her to marry him.
I've waited my whole life for this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane has entered the corkscrew.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any pen pals in Indonesia?
You may have to help her.
Mary fainted.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come to the concert with me?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd love to visit you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do that for you.
"Hi," said Tom timidly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She had no food.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
They're running.
The road does not match the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new sentence as a message in a bottle will one day be translated.
You won't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everybody loved you.
He and I are soul mates.
I have a granddaughter your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She's starting to get into her new office.
Let us take care of it.
I suppose you're sitting in my seat.
I was planning on doing it yesterday.
It's a little early to drink, isn't it?
My parents don't like my way of dressing.
If you want to stay, you can stay.
It'll be interesting.
I hit him gently and severely.
Because it's worse?
It's cheap.
Can I hold your hand?
It's green.
Tom heard a noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom was up all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about cellulite.
The series needs to start watching when all seasons are off!
Road accidents occur daily.
Where did you go to skiing?
Have you been to the hairdresser?
The prospects are frustrating.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ball handle.
The only way to find out what happened was to ask Tom.
I haven't slept for 48 hours.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
Go away.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's all take a picture together.
I failed in the exam.
Everybody knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
The football player made a huge mistake.
Are they coming too?
She sleeps like a baby.

Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The explosion blew up the entire building.
Tom kissed Mary and they hugged.
That's my cat.
Do you have children yet?
Tom didn't want breakfast.
Tom likes them.
Tom doesn't even know why he got kicked out of school.
Tom is a presumptuous idiot.
It keeps me awake at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I suppose you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom thinks throwing away food is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place bends to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about it yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom wiped his whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's responding.
That's the nicest guy I've ever met.
How much was it?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I was before.

No one knew that.
It's amazing.
He said he'd never do it.
The one who stole the pin will steal the cow.
Tom's not a good swimmer, is he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was only a shadow of his former self.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to come with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
Things happen.
What day is it?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm just a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss lily on his lips?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he was coming with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I have to stick together.
I've only heard good things about him.
I don't work here anymore.
Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You can't compare us.
I saw the car explode.
The window is here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw away my Playstation.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
Stay still!
What's your favorite TV show?
Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for disturbing me.
Tom's case is empty.
Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you'll be lost.
I like to go to school.
I offered to help.
I'll go back to Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son from me.
Her father seems to be a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
The dog is yours.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell Tom I'm going to visit his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?
I didn't mean to disturb him.
The officer gave his men courage.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying something like that.
I don't know much about hunting.
It's the first time I've ever cooked meat on a grill at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why would they do that?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom soon became very famous.
Everybody knew that already.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You shouldn't lie.
I know Tom's about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe that's what she said.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw the way he looked at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom should be home.
She was who I thought she was.
Tom showed the police his driver's license.
I cut my hair every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
This apple is sour.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new folder.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
Are you taking a job at home?
According to mythology, Prometheus stole the sacred fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All passengers managed to get out of the bus before it set fire.
I want to help you sort this out.
You speak French better than I do.
There are a lot of talented people in this town, but Tom doesn't belong to them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We take checks.
My bike is gone.
The stars flickered in the night sky.
I doubt Tom's gonna win.
"Eh, what can we do?" "Link alone can beat Ghenon." "So what can we do?" "All right, I'll grab my sword!" "Ah?" "Ah?" "Ah?" "Ah?" "Ah?" "Ah, an axe with a skull." "No." "Ah, what about a smoky bomb?" "Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah?" "Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah?" "Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah?" "Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah." "Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah."
Do you know who sings this song?
Is your watch going right?
I'll see you Sunday at 3:00.
I was at your wedding.
Tom barely knows how to swim.
You're good at it.

We can deal with them.
I just wondered if you had any experience you'd like to share with us.
Tom slept without a blanket.
Pray for us.
What kind of music do you listen to in the car?
That's what they told me three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French revolution began during the reign of Louis XVI.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get an invitation from Tom?
I want to swim in the sea.
It'll depend entirely on him.
I met a classmate.
He's old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our city was swamped.
No one saw them get out of the room.
Two big coffees, please.
We talked about you.
What kind of music do you usually listen to?
Without bread, food is not food.
It'll snow tomorrow.
You should have quit smoking a long time ago.
Stop joking!
Some of my classmates are full of nubs, they don't know anything about computers.
Did you like the bike?
I thought Tom was awake.
So they wouldn't let me go.
I didn't find them right away.
Hurry, please, Tom is waiting.
Listen to what the teacher says.
She's amazingly like the one of Marylin's.
I know who we can call for help with.
I'm stronger than you are.
She felt deeply sorry for her life.
I don't think Tom knows what he's doing.
I swear I didn't see her.
I really loved him.
Tom and I nodded in agreement.
In politics, respect is hard to earn, but it is easy to lose.
Stop acting like a child!
Let's go.
They're beginning to believe in their own lies.
Don't lift it.
Tom wants to paint his hair.
I've never seen her here before.
Why should I work with Tom?
I think it was your fault.
Do you think that's the best form of government?
If I tell you how it is, I'll be killed.
Reading is a habit that, once acquired, will never be lost.
Tom can stay in Australia for another week.

What are you trying to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell burning rubber?
That's not what happened here.
When will your father come home?
I understand.
Tom gave Mary a book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of the shower.
Tom's got a patient.
She didn't buy any bread.
Tom and Mary are single.
Tom will try to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom's suffocating.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to the party.
Her hair is wet by the sweat.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much that weighs?
A flight attendant is a master of compliments.
Tom's married to Mary, right?
All the bench in the park was busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
It works for me.
Vermont is located on the border with Canada.
He had to live in the same room as his brother.
I'm not an imbecile.
You'll fix it, won't you?
I don't know how to hunt.
He's got a brother in Tokyo.
The dynamite was invented by Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to intervene.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go if you like.
I know you shouldn't do that.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've already talked to this student.
What is the chemical symbol for Methyl Hydrogenic Acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like searching for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
So we need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do it.
Great!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a janitor.
I respect his views, although I disagree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the middle of town.
Who sent you?
She tied him up with a sweater.
I don't think Tom would want to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine, call cheaper?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use it, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We had no chance of winning.
How long are you planning on staying?
We had hadn't eaten yet and left immediately.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't drop anything on your feet.
Start every meal with the soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Have you ever called him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right in front of me.
The squirrel was open.
I brought some wine.
I'm not popular.
It's his first day at school.
I'm dying to meet you.
She's beautiful too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest a different strategy?
They died.
Apples are big.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
Is she singing?
I have to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened eagerly.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's take a car.
You're interrupting me.
She wondered what his lips would taste like.
A good coach trains this team.
The tree is sick.
The train was delayed because of heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What makes you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you eat?
Don't you recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning on doing it.
I'm falling.
I couldn't come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom wears new shoes.
Last year she learned how to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Since it was winter, he didn't go outside.
As I walked down the street, I saw a friend of mine.
How many houses are there on your street?
Elephant tusks are made of ivory.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"How's it going, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
Her mother tongue is French.
That coat's not exactly the same.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Naiveness is his only positive quality.
My hobby is collecting insects.
Tom lived in Boston as a child.
I haven't eaten in six days.
Can I tell them that?
She's been quiet all day.
No matter what he says, don't believe him.
I went on.
Tom and Mary hope that their next child will be a boy.
Mary is always very friendly, and she has a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies fall asleep under lullabys.
This is the best restaurant I know.
You could learn a lot from them if you just listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
Sorry to upset you.
One who has never left his country is full of prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when the snow falls.
Tom's helping his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I turned on the imagination.
I thought we could do that.
My mom didn't want me to drive alone.
Sorry, I misunderstood you.
You know what you're doing, right?
Machine translations can't be trusted.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
This river is full of fish.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
She and I are the same age.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had those symptoms before?
The prisoner has been released.
What did they say happened?
Could you leave the door open?
It'll have to wait.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my age.
Tom knows that what he did was a mistake.
Japan has a soft climate.
Check again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced the injured player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip went very smoothly.
It's inevitable that I'll go to France one day, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom's just pretending to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
You can open the windows again.
I've never had that before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was going out when the phone rang.
I don't have to take it.
Always give way to interference on the right.
We're being asked to introduce ourselves in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can give you a lift if you like.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes as much as a hot bath.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's an open book on the table.
Sorry, I totally forgot about that.
You have nothing to be sorry for.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice is like a melodic siren song for me.
How does it feel to be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like it.
My fingers left prints on the glass.
Chemistry is a wonderful science.
I feel like my French isn't getting much better.
How am I best able to get a passport?
Perhaps you can help Tom.
Tom is the best drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom's been ignoring Mary all day.
Tom's hair is fat.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he doesn't have a choice.
It's still bright outside.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
It's my father's car, but soon it'll be mine.
Have you forgotten his name?
If I had time to do it, I would.
Do you see Tom's boat?
Is Thomas big?
This medicine will help you.
Stop making noise.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how busy I was?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I have no one to trust.
She's a big city sex fan.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Be good with him.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing compares to a beer after a long working day.
What happened?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How long will it take you?
Let's take a break here.
Are you wearing new shoes?
You can leave if you like.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom said.
She made a grin when she saw the dog.
He's no greater than I am.
Smoking is strictly prohibited.
This peach is beautiful.
Can you see that?
Tom doesn't like it.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
Good job!
That's what you used to say.
Here are some letters for you.
It is almost unthinkable that a scientist of this level would have made such a fundamental mistake.
He doesn't have any evidence.
You don't look well.
He sailed very well when he was young.
I'm writing to a friend.
He's very good at tennis.
She misled the students.
She said she was Canadian.
Don't talk to anybody.
And when were you going to tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I filled the jar up.
Go straight ahead.
I'm too tired to think about it now.
What house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
What are we living for?
Will it rain this afternoon?
We know about her.
You could have helped us.
I don't drive often.
So I don't like the end of the movie.
Just get inside.
Just apologize to him.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm sick of you two.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventures.
Tom's in the library.
Were you at school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
Sorry, I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you satisfied?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm beginning to enjoy myself.
Tomorrow will be a heavy snowfall.
We decided to reschedule the meeting next Sunday.
She thinks she can prove it.
When was the last time you played golf?
Are we poor?
I don't know Tom's name.
We have the same dentist.
Not all Brazilians like carnival.
I don't think Tom knows what's going on.
Who did Tom sell his car to?
Tom's cheating.
I have to make money to be able to buy a computer.
Don't laugh at aliens.
I don't know them.
If you could choose genes for your children, would you?
That's why Mary has to rest.
He went to bed.
It could have been worse.
Tom did his part.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's keys are.
What book are you looking for?
I don't sleep much.
Someday you'll get there.
Tom's good with Mary.
"You owe me money." "No, you don't."
He came up and got on his knees.
You don't have to go if you don't want to.
This song always reminded me of my childhood.
Tom did it for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom earns three times as much as Mary does.
I've been drinking milk.
It'll snow tomorrow.
Isn't life wonderful?
When it comes to cooking, there's no one like Mary.
You haven't been yourself lately.
Tom lost his leg in a shark attack.
I baked it for you.
We'll do it as soon as the time comes.
Next year I'll be three times older than you.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your stamp collection.
It'll take forever.
Tom's not much above Mary.
Nobody seems to know him.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
This cloth is bothering your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's winter soon.
I think Tom was lying to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to.
Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up his professional gitarry game.
I'm married now.
It was only a few times.
You've gone too far this time.
It works.
Are you going to see Tom before you go?
No wonder,' replied Tom.
We want to rent an apartment in town.
They spoke French.
It's extremely expensive.
He's not singing anymore.
I didn't know what else to do.
They haven't woken up yet.
Tom's a couple inches above Mary.
I'm glad you offered that.
Your question is difficult to answer.
You don't believe her?
English is the world language.
Sounds easy.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told Tom to leave Mary alone.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for a job.
Why would Tom need a hammer?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
Things are getting worse.
I choose where to eat.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new car.
I just wanted to wish you good luck.
She's undressed.
I won't let you take my children.
Don't give it to him.
Run or you'll be arrested.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom made it a rule to meditate every morning.
Did you check your calculations?
He tried to make up a short story.
A room without books, like a body without a soul.
Why did God hurt us so much?
What does your brother do?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you in ages.
I visited Tony yesterday.
She's easy to impress.
You're old enough to do it yourself.
Aristotle thought the earth was the center of the universe.
I wonder what Tom really meant.
No one understands me.
There are so many stars in the sky, I can't count them.
Everybody turned around and looked at us.
Let me see.
White bears live in the Arctic.
I told you I was the best.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't need to be asked to do anything multiple times.
Let the dishes be washed today by the one who loses the stone-scissors-paper!
How unfortunate I am!
I would never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He speaks fast Russian -- at least he told me so.
Tom's a third grader.
How long will you stay?
I'm not a woman.
She has a tall father.
The train was full.
The house is red.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
You know Boston well, don't you?
The Orchestra has begun to play.
Mary was wearing a pirate suit.
It's not my wife.
Why didn't you mention it before?
Tom didn't want to be a snitch.
He was born at 7 a.m. on June 5, 1970.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are twins.
Tom only eats white meat.
Thank you for your help.
We only have three rules.
She bought one for herself.
Security didn't see Tom.
In recent years, Tom has become quite obsessive.
I helped carry those bags.
They have plenty of time.
Fifteen by five equals seventy-five.
I live in this hotel.
I don't want to know anymore.
You don't know what he'll say yet.
My hands are tired.
I've been lying to my wife all the time.
Finally, she succeeded.
It's outrageous that they weren't insured against the fire.
We've got plenty of money.
The exam was split into two parts.
When are you going to tell them?
Tom didn't want to talk about his illness.
Ah, it's so boring here!
Reading a book is like travelling.
Tom saw Mary go into the store.
Why aren't you there?
Tom said Mary would probably win.
A Japanese would never do that.
I miss Boston so much.
She writes letters all the time.
I don't know who to consult.
Turn left on the corner.
Tom taught me how to do it.
We can do a lot more.
Give me one, please.
I can't stand bad kids.
Tom bought it for me.
What you said made everybody angry.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for 30 years.
She showed her talents.
I wish it was possible.
I suppose you can't do that.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
At the next school festival, Bob will be playing the lead for the first time.
You have to stay in shape.
I've been digging seeds all day.
By accent, I realized he was American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Have mercy!
Tom obeyed.
All people of my generation think about it the same way.
I live for it.
Do you know how to ski?
The Duke owns many lands.
At least have fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's gradually getting better.
You'll feel like you're at home.
It won't end well!
He looked like he hadn't eaten in days.
I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who's Norman Finkelstein?" "American political scientist."
Get out of here!
So what is this, I wonder, if it's not selling goods at home, then maybe it's a new way to meet girls?
Tom picked up a coin.
Why didn't you clean your room?
If there is no God, everything is allowed.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please fasten your belt during takeoff and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both like seafood.
I've waited a long time for this.
I rejected the offer.
Do you want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
It'll take me too long to explain why this isn't going to work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build all this yourself?
I look forward to my summer vacation.
Can you put it differently?
It looks great from here.
Wooden houses are easily inflamed.
Let's throw Tom a party.
The dog's still alive.
I go to university.
I know you lied.
The bed is very comfortable.
I'll make a report on it tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a slut.
I want to listen to your side.
I'll wait here for him to come.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know Mary's shoe size.
I need to think about it properly.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is Jose, we're friends.
You forgot to mention it.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do it without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who arranged the meeting?
I'm such a bad guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in a skirt.
What kind of bird can't fly?
This has to stop.
Tom didn't answer right away.
Tom died at the age of seventy.
Life is a gift.
Tom speaks French.
The invention of the transistor marked a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.
Did you hear what she said about Alexei?
You look like a girl.
Here are some photos.
What's going on Channel 10?
I hate spinach.
Mother's cooking dinner.
Tom's a pilgrim.
What can I do?
Her son's a genius.
I know you've seen terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's inclined to let his emotions go.
We were shocked to hear of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I haven't seen you.
You just admit the obvious.
He had cancer.
It's your own fault that this happened.
It's as precise as clockwork.
I know where you're going.
You're catching up on everything.
Let's move him.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing this.
The cleaning woman interrupted the conversation.
There's a cat on the desk.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're not limping anymore.
Tom was a huge smoker.
Tom wore gloves.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to this weather.
I wonder who will help him decorate the snowman?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in soul mates?
What's that noise?
My son has a hereditary disease.
It's disgusting.
Is that snow?
I'll call you back.
He dropped the glass.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can marry your dog.
The best defence is an attack.
She's getting married this fall.
Sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easier.
Is there anything we can do to help you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
Japanese live on rice and fish.
When will you be ready to go?
The investigations began last year with the confiscation of the computer archives of a man from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's it going?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What makes you think you can't?
We were driving back through Boston.
Who would believe that?
Thank you for your correction.
Are you crazy?
Stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get that scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom's sharpening his pencil.
Tom doesn't know how to ride a bike.
I don't speak to the body at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much money do you need?
Mary laughed to tears.
I spent $500 in one day.
Tell them to go home.
You can put it anywhere.
They didn't make it on time.
It's seven thirty.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who told Tom that.
Tom got up early to see the dawn.
The Dinosauriers died a long time ago.
I usually climb stairs in one.
Tom's had another year.
I'm near the station.
Tom's a very good boy.
Do you drink?
You're from Boston, aren't you?
Put it on my desk.
Tom got out of the water.
I was very proud of it.
You were ready.
Do you know Tom's brother?
All lizards can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
I've got it all out of my hand today.
I asked them to stay away from it.
Tom only learned to drive at thirty.
I'm glad he wasn't hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
The kitchen knife wasn't sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my pen knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You'll soon adapt to village life.
Keep the bucket next to the water.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We all got along.
There's a river that's deeper than anything.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I've told you that a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
They died.
Tom and Mary kissed.
Writing words separately when they are to be written together is a big problem in Norwegian.
What are you doing with the rest of the rice?
It's been ten years since she died.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Do you need anything else?
We left shortly afterwards.
It's a book worth reading.
Tom and Mary had their homework before dinner.
I don't want to drink your tea.
You're always so romantic.
A wife doesn't have boots, she can't get off her feet.
I'll pick you up at six.
I teach Tom French.
I like to learn other languages.
Mary has brown eyes.
I'd like to know how long Tom plans to stay in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
How did you feel?
Let's give Tom a chance.
I like fruit.
Tom lied.
He's a car salesman.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope not."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate sick food.
I ate caviar.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to make sure.
Tom gave Mary's gun.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They got on the bus first.
Let's wait till Monday.
Does anybody here know them?
There must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to smelling.
Tom didn't want anybody to know.
How was your day?
It's your fault.
I told you what time to come.
Of course I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever spoken to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get to the point.
Tom was sitting on the stairs.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes lightning hits twice in the same place.
I'm not bragging.
Leave it for later.
Tom told Mary not to leave the door unlocked.
Tom blames Mary for John's death.
It's up to you.
Were you surprised?
We counted the annual rings on the tree that we cut down and determined he was thirty years old.
I feel like I've known you my whole life.
I want Tom to never write to my daughter again.
Rabbits reproduce quickly.
I don't want to discuss this right now.
What's the cost of cleaning your coat?
We'll paint it.
The hole is narrow.
I'm not afraid to go to the cave.
When happiness knocks on your door.
You need to listen to her.
I wish you knew how much you mean to me.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
Tell me frankly.
I'll come at anything.
Do you mind making another cup of coffee when you want it?
I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Honolulu.
You're not telling me anything I don't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom left last.
Tom signed the application.
Have you tried to talk to Tom about this?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
We don't know much about Tom.
How was your day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me some time.
Do you want them to help?
You can't see Tom anywhere.
I was the one who told Tom to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruit ever.
Could you close the window?
Tom didn't have a ticket.
We can meet again in the near future.
The trees calmed me down.
He's a woman worker.
I slept on my stomach.
Keep me posted.
You have the right to your opinion.
Mary told me she'd buy it.
I made breakfast.
I'd like to buy two stamps of forty-five cents, please.
I'll give you a bike for your birthday.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.
Beer is beer.
I don't think Tom would like that.
I thought he was innocent.
I'll wait for you here.
I'd like you to talk to him.
I thought you said it was yours.
Tom's doing his research.
Look at that cat.
I'm divorced.
That's extremely interesting.
Don't stay late.
That's what we're working on.
Everybody having fun?
Tom watches figure skating on TV.
We'll have to sleep on the street tonight.
Did Tom show Mary how it was done?
Amazing, isn't it?
I've had my face.
The school is only five minutes away.
Tom put a spoon in his pocket.
Is that the only thing you care about?
Do you see a rose?
Mary was trying to hide her tears.
Self-confidence is the key to success.
I just want to be a good father.
I'll send you a link.
