Republic Strategy against Obama's Re-Election
Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to combat election falsification.
However, at the Brennan Center, the latter is considered a myth, arguing that cases of election fraud in the United States are more rare than those caused by a lightning strike.
In addition, Republican lawyers have counted only 300 cases of electorial falsification in the United States in ten years.
One thing you can say with confidence is that these new trends will have a negative impact on the turnout of voters.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, US states are responsible for the organization of U.S. federal elections.
That is why most state governments have enacted laws since 2009 that make registration or voting more difficult.
This phenomenon gained a new momentum after the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to the Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights in 41 states were passed in just one year.
New election laws require the elector to present a photographic identity card and evidence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right to register the elector on the day of will and remove the right to vote from citizens holding a criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present a photographic identity card.
Indiana was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastily extended this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills to require voters to submit photography ID cards in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have as universal an identity card as a health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of the age required to vote, do not have an identity card with a photograph issued by their state government.
Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such a document.
However, the cost of getting the required identity card often exceeds $100.
New restrictions dissociate young people, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photography identity.
But that's not all.
Student voters, who are believed to vote for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use a photographic identity card issued by their educational institution.
However, these same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mostly for Republicans, to use the licenses issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no state required proof of American citizenship to vote.
This was the first time that such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are US citizens.
These measures are apparently intended to limit the voting of Latin Americans.
It is believed that two thirds of Latin American voters vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated laws in 2011 to abolish the registration of voters on voting day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those wishing to register.
This limitation did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, a campaign to register voters helped to put about 10 million citizens on the list.
However, measures taken since 2009 had led to a 17 per cent drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have enacted laws in five other states to reduce the period of early voting.
Thus, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, although the latter represented only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.
The same happened to Latin Americans.
They represented only 11 per cent of the voters, representing 24 per cent of the citizens who had voted early.
Unlike white voters, who formed 76 per cent of the voters, only 46 per cent of the voters were voters.
Of course, democratic lawmakers and their advocates are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws have been enacted by the democratic governors.
The most ambiguous laws were suspended when the United States Attorney-General intervened.
This has partly limited the negative effects.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have enacted laws requiring photography identity.
However, the new rules that have come into effect will certainly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Democratic critics condemn the biased laws that have been adopted, with a clear focus on affecting the 2012 elections in key states.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the Bench to win the Presidential elections.
It is too soon to say with confidence that these legislative changes at the level of the election system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 Presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new regulations will have a negative impact on the turnout of voters.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy.
Prostate cancer scanning: Do you want to test or not?
In fact, the PSA test produces sometimes erroneous results, false and sometimes false positive results that lead to useless medical interference.
Men, who are so reluctant to go into therapy, have much more to doubt.
Do you want to pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
Research in the United States has seen numerous cases of infection among groups of researchers, so it is difficult to interpret the data and it is difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found that the mortality rate was different for patients who had been screened and for those who had not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the probability of metastasy is 30-40% higher for those who have not gone through the scan.
So I would recommend that the test take place from the age of 50, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer is detected.
The cancer can be both aggressive and vintage.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer by offering him options without necessarily treating prostate cancer, which does not pose a risk to life in the long term, and by choosing, in these cases, to actively monitor the disease.
To date, many men diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is neither aggressive nor life-threatening.
We'll offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts to progress, we'll start the treatment.
Increasingly, we define the criteria for making a decision as to who should or should not be treated.
So I would recommend that you do the test after all.
But it is also important to consult your doctor in order to determine whether or not you should take the test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Moviember has developed a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Avoid Sickness
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in scientific research, healthy living remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people were well fed and moved enough, 30 percent of cancer cases could have been prevented.
"If no one else had smoked, that figure would have increased to at least 50%," stressed Andre Bolieu, Spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking control remains a priority, despite a decrease in smoking.
Smoking accounts for 85% of lung cancer cases.
And it's a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous harm to human health.
"Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says press secretary Andre Bolieu.
It is encouraging that 10 years after smoking, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
Weight
According to CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, thick and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Study shows that regular physical activity throughout your life protects against colon cancer," they add to the Association.
Power
The Association also recommends limiting the use of red meat.
In too many cases it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausage should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salt can lead to carcinogens.
"The latter can harm the body's cells and lead to cancer," explained the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many researchers have been researching the effects of micronutrient supplements on cancer.
But at present, the results of these studies are not clear.
According to SCC, the results of the Vitamin E studies are contradictory.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, the other had the opposite effect.
There is also a lack of clarity in the evaluation of the effects on the development of vitamin D cancer.
However, he stressed that it was important to discuss his concerns and family history with the doctor.
"Repeat doesn't lead to cancer."
Higgs Boson in Details
Over the past summer, the report that scientists might have managed to locate Higgs' boson caused a real emergency -- and not without reason.
This boson is believed to explain the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
Also, it's the last particle that was predicted to exist in the Standard Model -- our best, or at least the least imperfect, description of the nature and behavior of matter -- but which had never been discovered in the past.
But physics isn't quite sure it's about Higgs' boson.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we're dealing with a really new particle and that it's very much like the Higgs Boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Moreover, the new data presented this week at a major physical convention in Kyoto seems to support this, although some data are not yet available for full confidence.
Let's say this is about Higgs' boson, because the chances of making mistakes seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law that is absolutely inevitable, saying that two things can't end up in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to get past this rule, don't even try too hard, otherwise you'll hurt yourself.
But while physics of elementary particles is a rather strange world, it turns out that there's one law of this kind in it too: Paulie's exclusion principle, which suggests that two particles cannot take the same space at the same point in time, if they're in the same "quantum state" -- this "state" is, in general, some of their characteristics.
So physics divides particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called farmers, who wisely follow the principle of Paulie.
The other is the fuss of a boson, an abominable gang of anarchists, who have no respect for anything, at least for this principle, which means that they can calmly find themselves in the same place at the same time.
According to the site (of course, quite unusual) of the Berkeley Laboratory, these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesomons we're not going to talk about, and the "particles of power" by which the main forces of nature are spread, and which in some way include the Higgs Boson.
These very bosons, it should be stressed, are not all such exotic creatures as might be thought of.
In fact, if you can read this chronology, it's because of one incredibly banal boson, a photon, or "part of the light," which is the "courier" of an electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a single particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it "breaks" an electromagnetic field in this particular place, about as a rock thrown into the pond.
This "violation" produces an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.) and it is nothing but a photon, and hence one of the "power carrier" bosons.
A more stable field
The same thing happens with Higgs' boson, with the only difference that in order for that boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be "broken."
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to energize it, it must be achieved with very high and very high energy, as if it were a frozen pond whose surface could only shake a very large stone.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerator, like the one that's being used in CERN -- the Great Adronic Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 kilometers! -- to achieve such huge energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful in explaining the relationship between Higgs' boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with an electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact, others don't: a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on the fridge.
Likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like photon, by the way) do not.
So what "can bring" all this research, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to test the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to perceive the difference between observations and projections of the MS.
Besides, some of them are passionately anxious to see this difference occur, because the slightest incompatibility can open the door to "new physics" and shut some of the models' holes.
The latter, to say, still has significant shortcomings, without suggesting any explanation for gravity (a!) or for dark matter that forms about 80 percent of the universe (a!).
But so far, the CERN has not found such differences.
Effect
It is harder to predict from these studies for the daily lives of average humans, but it would be a mistake to assume that they are not.
See, in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in Bella's labs couldn't even imagine what revolution their work would trigger.
They anticipated their applications in science, but nothing more.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who was working at Belle's Labs, where a laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (previously impulsive) in 1962, said that the laser was originally treated as a more "labular gadget".
Imagine...
And besides, an application can be found for a tool to accompany the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his optical research in 1969.
This sensor, although not at all its original purpose, now serves as the "eye" for all digital cameras in the world and has won the 2009 Nobel Prize in physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Adron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that anything can happen.
Palliative help is the best way to die...
The Commission for Decent Death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
Debate should soon resume, and a bill was being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
The Long tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monterey.
Prostate cancer that destroyed it from the inside gave it a two-year deferral.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed at Victor-Gadbua's palliative exit shelter in Belhoi, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's always a shock, you can't prepare for it," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet and even eating on your own.
As he sits at a table where he has a delicious meal, he gives up and agrees to be helped to eat.
He's cheering up, even getting to smile, talking to strangers who work around him, bringing him drugs, taking him to the bathtub.
Courage before normal death.
"My greatest wish for me to be cured of diarrhea is humiliated," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this disease.
"Lifetime we're taught that a man should pee standing up," says Pierre Broder, a therapist at Victor-Gadbua's shelter.
Regression to the condition of the child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
"All depends on a person's ability to accept the decline," he claims.
Because, according to many palliative caretakers, important events occur in the midst of this decline.
The patients who go to Victor-Gadbua's palliative shelter are all cancer patients.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of their life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses is no longer providing care, called the "Healthy".
Mrs. A., 89 years old, is most afraid to die "in a state of asphyxiation."
But the disease made it possible for me to get to know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in my life," she says, before I let her put a mask that eases her breath.
She still awaits her son's last visit from Italy in the coming days.
At the Victor Gadbua shelter, a group of volunteers provide body care and food support.
That's palliative care that stays when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
Québec has one place in palliative institutions for every 11 700 inhabitants.
That's not enough, given that we're all going to die sooner or later.
This is where life continues under the best possible conditions, explained Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors at the shelter.
Whether the comfort is physical, emotional, or emotional.
To the dying, we'll agree to provide mouth-stuffs of brandy or pepsi, regardless of what he asks.
Diabetes are no longer forced to control sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died last night.
His son had finished this beer in his legs this morning.
"We help loved ones as well as patients," says Natalie Savar, director of nursing.
Victor Gadbua's shelter doesn't look like the previous day.
Next to a 93-year-old, who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the courtyard, resting on his pillows during a toast to his honour, is dying tragically by a 36-year-old, surrounded by parents, a wife and two young children and tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months, between three and five beds, always occupied by cancer patients under 45 years of age," said Dr. Christian Martel anxiously.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor Gadbua shelter come from home and 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is believed that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care that is provided to ease the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, hospital or shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor-Gadbua shelter and the Greater Montreal House Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this huge gap in Quebec's health system that makes many palliative doctors afraid of a law legitimizing euthanasia and suicidal care.
Beginning in October, a manifesto signed by the laymen in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapuant, showing their opposition to such an initiative, has been circulating.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec's health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to palliative care of high quality before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the E.R. in terrible pains, and no one took the necessary measures to ease them.
I'm afraid the only reason the patients want to die is because they don't get proper care.
At the same time, many oncologists have been trying to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
Ellen Richard's hope of survival was already minimal when she stopped exhausting chemo.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting the treatment, she said that she was sorry that I was stopping the struggle, she said.
At the same time, she told me herself that my days were numbered!
There's no strong exit.
Dr. Martel thinks that 90% of the patients who ask for death thank the medical staff for failing to comply with their request after the palliative care team has eased their pain.
However, it should be pointed out that palliative care is not entirely powerful in the struggle against pain.
According to Elsie Munro, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal House, patients are not sensitive to pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of their lives, doctors often resort to a palliative session in which the patient sleeps until he dies, either occasionally or permanently.
We can't pretend that we don't know about this suffering anymore.
Increasingly, patients who fail to ease the pain will be able to access a palliative session.
People with pain always say the same thing, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to get euthanasia," which means "I want to feel better."
The creation of this report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
The officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction agents, political party fund-raisers and Italian Mafia professionals tell day after day what they know about the huge “system” of the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mobists.
The industry, which was very expensive to Quebec's tax payers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's curious how this system disintegrates after all the means have been put on the table," he jokes, "the deputy and former police chief of Montreal."
It was because of it that a scandal broke out in 2011 as a side-by-side result of the investigation of official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the then-liberal Prime Minister, Jean Share, had very reluctantly accepted.
The Duceno Report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"Since the investigation began in 2010, he stresses that the Department of Transport alone would have kept a billion dollars on the contract" if some had restrained their instincts to take a share.
The Charbonno Commission "has already removed the two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will be able to "discover the schemes behind the individual."
Standing anti- corruption unit established in 2011
The case was joined by the Standing Unit against corruption, which was set up in 2011 and was composed of a large number of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And in addition, the members of the special unit Molote, who have forced the Montreal “silver cartel” since 2009, to stop over-pricing the contract.
In recent weeks, a series of searches had been carried out, and some municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcott, the mayor of a small town, had been charged with fraud and corruption.
The next is Gilles Wyangcourt, who recently resigned as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of receiving multiple bribes when placing government orders.
In addition, official charges were brought against several route engineers of Montreal and construction agents of Italian origin, including Tony Accurto and Lino Zambito.
The latter blew up a real bomb, reporting an investigation into the "system" of getting government contracts.
For several years, Zambito had given 3% of the value of the Montreal contract to a Mafia intermediary, who in turn had transferred the money of the "United Montreal" party to the mayor of Giralde Tramble.
In the 2000s, Zambito swept his money to the right and left, and he transferred over 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mostly the liberals in power at the time.
In addition, he confessed that he was illegally raising funds for the former deputy prime minister from the party of Liberia, Natalie Normando.
Excessive contract analysis
In Montreal, the corruption system worked unreservedly.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: within ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes for a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewerage services, the value of which he overstretched.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads admitted to having received 30-40 per cent in excess of their bills with false additions.
Then a organizer from the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately ignoring the existence of a parallel budget that filled party cash with dirty money.
Following these discoveries, Mr. Tramble resigned in early November, putting Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first members in Montreal to be alarmed.
The mayor of the Rivier-de-Prerie district, in the east of the island, has been struggling since 2010 with the sale of a five million-dollar, re-sold to... $1.6 million developers in the middle of a building block.
70% of the dirty money in campaigning
She says that in an investigation that will eventually be launched, she "will pull a thread to understand the functioning of the ant-infested system in order to stop gangrene and identify the culprits."
It is a process that is described as a pain but a positive one.
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and observer to avoid the return of dubious practices.
How we clean the house.
Regularly.
He notes, for his part, that "workers stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but is particularly concerned about the role of "elective officials who knew about this scheme" but who did not participate in the fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money in funding the Quebec election campaign is 70%, he jokes, "I've been told it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The government of Quebec has offered to limit to $100 a donation to the parties, but he says it won't change the situation: "Until we severely limit the costs of elections, politics will have dirty money."
It requires a complete reconfiguration of the State contract and party financing system: "We cannot fall below; by taking a bold look at the bottom of things, we can build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and justice."
If this story is a shadow to the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duceno calls upon those who laugh to look into their own courtyard ...
"SVU is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you've achieved an extraordinary scale in the SVU.
How do you explain that growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but it can also be explained by a new dimension of the SVU.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up next to them every day.
Technical staff have also made a great difference.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
It's all happening very quickly in football.
But I'm not breaking up.
From the beginning, I've always been moving forward at the IF Pre-Training Centre in Clarefonten, and before I came to St.
So you're taking advantage of the competition set by Carlo Anchelotte...
Filling this summer is not a good time to play very high-level games.
They also know that every training is very important.
This results in a player like me wanting to be on the level and put up to the maximum.
Carlo Anchelotte also supports my position.
He's being helped by alternates like Claude Maciquelle, who played in the same position as I did.
Ancelotte is the owner of the position?
Of course.
Anchelotti is showing respect to all technical staff.
He is one of the best coaches in Europe in the First League today.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with high-class clubs.
He was working with the big players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I walked away from a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the CSW season?
In the First League, Lyon took our leader's seat.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have been effectively ranked in the eighth finale.
What's the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to get as far away as possible.
From now on, everything can be.
We can say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, in front of Porto, to be able to take back the match in one of the eight finals.
Will CSW be able to become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for that...
To become a large European club, Paris needs to win titles and maintain positions for the long term.
That's not true today.
Financially, the WWF has the means to make this project real.
Not taking a title in the First League, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want this championship.
Last season, we were close to that.
In May, there was disappointment, because we had everything to come to the end first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
Typically, 79 points assume the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be all right.
Despite the fact that such strong teams as Marcel, Lyon and Bordeaux have fought for the title, I think we have the power to win.
Don't you think the media expect too much from the SVU?
It's okay that we're expected to do a lot, given how much investment we've had and how many players we have.
We're all ready for that.
On the other hand, when we're at home winning 4-0 against Trua and we're still found to be critical, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We wonder what people want from us first.
We can never win every weekend with a 4-0 score.
We're not Barcelona's FC!
We're trying to introduce a game project.
The command is formed over time.
We have proved in the League of Champions that we can meet modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who has not been able to make it to the eighth finale for two seasons, even though they have spent a lot of money too!
Given the amount invested, we represented you 15 points ahead by the winter break.
That would be contempt for our opponents and for the French championship.
Leon and Marcel, who hadn't been at the top of the previous season, were "frequently awakened" by this new SVU.
This shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The SCW seems to be entirely dependent on the achievements of Zlatan Ivrivich.
So what if they say there's some sort of "Golden addiction."
This only means that Irbanich is very successful and has scored a lot of heads.
He came in for this and he proves he's the star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and a world-wide star.
In the group, we respect him as a man and a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was really exclusive.
This also encourages others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best advocates in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive the Euro2012 with the French team?
How disappointed.
I was eager to join the European Union.
Unfortunately, my injuries prevented me from wasting some game time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I got out more.
I'm doing a good match today.
That's what I've been hoping for since my Baptism with the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what has happened in Ukraine, and we must now behave exemplaryly.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Desham at the head of the Blues?
They're good for him.
He's got a good position in the selection team for the world championship.
He's a strict coach, he's close to the players, and he's inspiring to win.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc has achieved his goal; he has qualified us for Europe.
I hope Didier Desham brings the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved tie (1-1) ripped out on 16 October in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match gave us confidence in ourselves.
Everybody fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, there were no such games in my career.
To pay and sell without the help of the banks--with Bitcoin
Total contrast to current monetary exchange based on central banks numbered transactions between receiving parties with commission fees for processing them.
Moreover, as often happens to these technologies, a political vision is evident: the belief that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, is causing financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Sathoshi Nacomoto (pseudonom), is simultaneously a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, Euro ...) and a protected BitTorrent type exchange protocol that allows for the exchange of files between members of the same level.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers online.
Several thousand websites take bitcoins for donation or payment.
After reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, the rate dropped to 2 dollars five months later before returning to about ten dollars today (curses are listed on Bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the world's exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its October Virtual Currency Report was interested in the system.
He describes Bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency," "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "like the usual currency."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency, like “lending” used to advance in a video game that is earned during the game or that can be bought (and sometimes traded).
The Facebook social network has also developed such a system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by a central authority.
In Bitcoin, all network nodes are both account holders, accountants, currency issuers, purchasers and salesmen.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually occurs between two email addresses, like email.
Only for each new payment can the user choose another address, thus providing anonymity.
The set of information relevant to this transaction is signed automatically using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the contents of the file, it is possible to check that the bitcoins used in the transaction do exist in a public account distributed all over the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It goes through a mathematical task sent to computers that, like a temporary central bank, enjoys the privilege of adding this new string.
This is the hash phase of a file, i.e. converting a large file to a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before they're all "hash" together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, other knots can easily verify that it is correct.
Transaction thus turns out to be incessantly connected to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If the user wanted to pay the same money twice in less than ten minutes for the purpose of cheating, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other one would remain unsupported because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the reward is regularly divided into half, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of Bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one hundred million, leaving a reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with increased computing capacity.
The network's life has already survived ups and downs.
Sites providing Bitcoin services were attacked and Bitcoins were stolen from the reserves.
"The fault used does not affect the protocol itself," said Pierre Nuaz, who recently launched Paymium, a company that pays with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB has also reported that money may be laundered through this anonymous service.
But cash also has that disadvantage.
Large players like Wikipedia refuse to accept this kind of donation.
Others, such as WordPress blogs, are allowed.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weitzman Institute in Israel analyzed the account book and found that almost 80 percent of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
The "Gigant sale" was announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been traded," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinaboul, who converts Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of this currency allowance, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or an unconnected payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is cheaper.
The owner better controls his personal data and may thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for employers who do not need to install new devices or software.
It's enough to give you an address that can be photographed and recognized by a phone, and Pierre Nuasa tells you that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to renegotiate hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal ones.
"Before Bitcoin is established, it will take some time, but the year 2013 may be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB's report suggests, by the way, a rethinking of the various risks which are considered to be high today if this system is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capisa and Surobi).
Both the North Atlantic and the United States are expected to follow them in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future without relying on us alone.
We have suffered mostly Afghan peasants, whom we considered to be terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 dead soldiers, and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former fugitives in Pakistan, but also often peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case in the USSR.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
They are being patient, sometimes assisted by local rebels, but will no longer be as soon as the West becomes more sensitive.
The departure of the French forces from the Nidjrab base, which I had observed from the height of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credit, was in order.
The convoys of the truck and armoured aircraft accompanied by the helicopter reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban attacks on Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their insurmountable progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the country was in fire and blood because of a struggle between different groups.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid for the gloomyness of these peasants, in whom they have been overstretched by Al-Qa'idah, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mujahidees, the Afghan Government and the present Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a position of subordination.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen taking over government land to re-sell them to returnees from Iran and Pakistan, using huge United States sub-contracts.
They're discredited; most of them, by the way, didn't even fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the countryside, want a government that doesn't consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have succeeded in American generousness: capital outflows are significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; there are now 5 million people in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
There is a need to provide jobs for these young people, who will not want to return to the obscurity of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed combatants, likes mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, representing the modern world, and watches everywhere.
There's an army now.
Will the authorities who will command it be considered legitimate?
The anti-Soviet leaders are already taking steps to restore their provincial wives, who would not be subject to the central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country, with strong local differences, must be somewhat devolved, modelled by Western countries, but the United States wanted to transform it into a central State with strong Presidential power by removing the post of Prime Minister which had existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the April 2014 elections.
But his country, starting in the 1950s, and even before, depended on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is functioning, and no irrigating system has been repaired.
All are imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruit.
Priority is given to a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumours that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth.
This only increased the feeling that Western countries were there to take over.
Without the power to process iron ore or copper locally, without means of transport to export them through mountains, there is no extraction of minerals.
The Chinese had almost left the Mes Ainak media field, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhism complex and remain the largest employer in the province.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which rely heavily on imports and exports, re-establish normal relations one day.
The withdrawal of the French military units ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: girls' faces, boys' faces, the French language department at the University, the French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to win hearts and minds and to perform the impossible task of balancing aid with offensive operations, the military-civil service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French social organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities designed to restore farming in dozens of mountain villages.
These efforts, with intensive local labour, have helped to contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, soil protection and an increase in arable land.
What will we leave to remember by spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would improve the living conditions of the local population, which is very severe in these valleys, often at a height of over 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Mission received dozens of written requests for small-scale farming from local communities in Capisa Province.
In order to get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, which the farmers wanted, as they told me, they needed a little non-war support that was well-controlled and directly addressed.
Difficult birth of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky move by President Muhammad Morsi.
While Egypt was more divided than ever, on the question of a constitutional declaration which temporarily gave it extraordinary powers, it had decided to play a waffle.
After surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Founding Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave the Assembly two extra months to finish the job.
Soon, two years ago, Egypt was relying on a draft text that had been amended several times, which weakened institutional stability and led to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only reinforced the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocracy" by continuing to violate the word and to violate the right.
In the camp, his followers are convinced that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that forces the brothers to give up their intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, article after article.
For the President, it is also a way to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Muhammad Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview to American weekly Time.
Since the call for an accelerated vote is based on the ultimatum of the Egyptian people, "or you vote for my text, or I leave myself with extraordinary powers," which are expected to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Founding Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most liberators did not respond to the challenge.
In mid- November, shortly before the constitution declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to communicate their opinions.
Human rights advocates, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary Quorum, 11 persons, the spares, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslims.
Not surprisingly, in most cases the articles were voted by one voice.
The commentators, by the way, were amazed at the fact that one of the few differences of the day occurred around... the time for prayer, because some members of the committee felt that the time of the Congregation was wrong.
The text on which the vote was still held yesterday consisted of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, article 2 ultimately remained the same as the article in the 1971 Constitution, which states that “Shariah principles are the main source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law was a fundamental requirement, had hoped to replace “principles” with “rules”, which would make it possible to apply them more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is evidence of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Physicism," answers the liberators, who only see it as a PR.
Because they believe that the Islamicization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, particularly with regard to the verification of the observance of sharia law.
According to Egypt's specialist Sofia Pomier, this is disturbing because “the people who are responsible for making decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever”.
We can observe the birth of theocracy."
Many liberators are also encouraged by the fact that the next president of this university seems to be much less moderate than the current one.
"There is currently no specific religious interference.
With this constitution, we remain under civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulema, but university students, some have been studying in the French system," calms Alexis Bloe, who prepares a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that “there may be ambiguities around article 220, since the terms used in it are taken from religious language.
This applies in particular to “fictions” [islamic law, e.g.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to how competent civil judges are to rule on this."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday was criticized because it gave wide powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslims claim that they have been significantly reduced compared to those of the old regime.
Another point of contention is the power of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, consideration of the defence budget will not take place in Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
Nor would the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests from associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text which they considered to be deleterious to freedom.
The responsibility for blasphemy had been preserved and insults were now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, and especially for freedom of the press.
Besides, none of the articles speaks any more of the protection of a woman, as Heba Moraef, of Human Rights Watch, points out.
She said that the only positive point was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that hadn't appeared in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was scheduled to appear on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
The champions of the Head of State will, in turn, go to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Pup of Earth and the sea from the skies
The Promised Land combines the greatness of Bible truths, the modern comfort, and the predestination of nature.
AIF has highlighted five of the most important reasons why it is necessary to visit Israel.
Baptize Holy Places
It is worth a visit to the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that all who go into this "buyer" have the grace of God.
And Galilee is the place of Jesus' miracles: to turn water at wedding into wine, walk by water, calm the storm, and fill the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
But most holy places in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here follow the Path of Grief or the Holy Path of Jesus (Latin, Via Doloros).
It begins at the fortress of Antony-Pretorium, where there was a trial, and leads down the streets of the Old City to the Temple of the Lord at Mount Golgotha, to the place of crucifixion, the Stone of Salvation, and the place of the burial of Jesus.
Here, too, is the symbolic Christian Earth Poup, symbolizing the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be erected in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which a cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
There is also the most holy place in Jerusalem for the Jewish people, the Wall of Cry, left by the Temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different confessions leave notes here with wishes that follow.
Make a vertical voyage
The ruins of Massada's fortress were left from the secret refuge from the enemies that Herod the Great had built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on mountainous rocks at a height of 450 m above the sea level.
Only climbers are able to get to them.
The rest of this historical peak is borne by a lift along the cable road.
And in the north of the country, there's a famous Hermon Mining resort, at an altitude of 1600-2040 metres, where in winter months there's a huge flood of tourists.
He's got a shuttle bus at the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski tracks is 45 km.
Ancient tradition suggests that pagan gods lived on top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You don't have to go to everyone for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Israeli Museum, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in the caves of the Jewish Desert, and about 500 000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It's worth a visit to the Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv.
His exhibition contains extensive paintings of impressionists and expressionists from Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cesanna, Cessilla, Matissa, Modillani, Chagalla, Picasso.
You can visit the Al-Bash Museum in Akko, which is a series of ancient Turkish baths with suits of visitors and banners of the time.
In Cesarea, you should go to the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the paintings of Dali and Rodin.
There are no guidebooks or souvenir shops.
The entrance is free and the donation is categorically rejected.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad-Wash in Tel-Aviv, speaks of one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section, the Children's Memory, was built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas cells.
You walk into it and you end up in absolute darkness.
The stars are blinking.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died are sounded.
Ukraine is mentioned there too.
Get Happily
The three main Israeli resort zones are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each has pools, water parks, dolphins, and oceaniums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is bathed even in winter months, since the temperature of the sea does not fall below 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is still warmer, and there they bathe all year.
By the way, this is the most extraordinary sea in the world at the lowest point of the planet, 417 metres below the ocean level.
The azure water in it is dissolute, easy to keep floating even if they can't swim at all.
Landscapes are unreally beautiful.
They're coming here to get treatment with salt water -- rapa, and medicinal soils, and to treat health with dermatitis, allergic, asthma, eczemic, arthritis, pulmonary diabetic, to fix the shaken nerves.
Touch Old Secrets
They are kept by the ancient part of Tel-Aviv, the town of Yaffa on the shore of the Mediterranean.
Through it passed the famous sea route, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, this is where Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists are very fond of wandering through narrow streets named after Zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "my" sign, Fortuna will be nice.
In Jaffa you can find newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even from other countries for a photo shoot.
And in Cesarea, the city of King Herod, you can wander around the Roman theatre, "remove" the fortress of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Cesarea was the main city of Judéa and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
A carefully restored theatre is now being used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourist for Note
As you go to Israel, don't worry about your imperfect English: about 30 percent of the population in the country speak Russian.
It is best to borrow money for a trip in dollars rather than in euros, which are easily traded for shekels (currently US$ 1-3.8).
City transport is mostly buses, but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram, and Haifa is the country's only metro line, composed of six stations, connecting the Lower City to the Upper.
In fact, it's an underground funikler.
Travel in all forms of urban transport is worth six shekels, for which you can travel with transplants within 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Sabbath Sabbath is celebrated according to Jewish tradition.
From Friday evening until sundown on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport are shut down.
And Sunday morning, the week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants, and hotels, only cosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes, which combine milk with meat.
There they offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soup and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta hummus, various sauces, hammered beef balls - phalel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no wandering dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there's a lot of fed cats that's "walking on their own."
Even on the roofs of parked cars, they can be seen sleeping in the evening.
Murples love crowded places and don't give up meals.
The rental of a car, depending on the stamp, will cost between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is 15 dollars a day.
And a bike rental costs 15 secs a day.
The average price of tickets to museums is 30 shekels.
Numeric language
In 2012, over three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most of the trips and vacations came from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
Between January and October 2012, there were 118,800 Ukrainian tourists on the Promised Land, an increase of 51 per cent over the 2010 figure, before the revocation of the visa on 9 February 2011.
"Great and Powerful" to Moscow will prove that immigrants are saving money into their tongue
While MPs and human rights advocates are arguing about a law on binding language testing, there are already fraudsters in the country who sell “lipy” certificates.
Every year 13 million gastrobytes arrive in Moscow, Petersburg, and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families left behind.
On 1 December, a law had entered into force under which every worker would be obliged to take a Russian language proficiency exam.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the areas of services, public utilities, living and retail.
However, in time, the FMS promises, the tests will be binding on all visitors.
However, not only the language but also Russian history and the basis of legislation will have to be handed over.
Language skills will have to be confirmed for both receipt and extension of work permits.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the State language.
Nor did people who had completed their studies and degrees before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Value, doom and protection of rights
The network of examination points will be run by the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of the People, the MGU, the SBGU and other Russian universities.
More than 160 such centers have already been opened in Russia and will be able to test immigrants in all cities.
Both the State Duma and the FMS supported the initiative to introduce testing.
And the human rights activists, before the law came into force, had many times asked the press what that would do.
What will change the requirement of language for both Russians and visitors themselves?
First of all, the migration service responds, which will reduce the number of people suffering from “labour bondage”.
A lot of people are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explaining the head of the Russian FMS office in Tajikistan, Victor Seslev.
The protection of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only a system of organized recruitment will 90% solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in the case of immigrants without a profession or education that do not know a language that does not have a medical certificate.
Without an understanding of the language, I'm sure it is doomed to a future foreigner to encounter uninformed people who, under the guise of help, will put him into a dreadfully narrow bark, where he and dozens of his kind will spend months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We're getting a lot of complaints from our immigrants.
"They are promised one thing at home, and upon arrival they are deceived, their passports are taken, and their wages are not paid," confirmed the head of the General Migration Department of the MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't fight, squirrel!
However, as long as many citizens of the Central Asian republics who are going to work in Russia have recognized that not only do they not know the language of the country in which they want to go, but they are also writing hard on their own.
Of course, it is not so much their fault but their trouble: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even meaningful primary education.
For their families have nothing to eat, let alone proper clothes, shoes, and clothes for school.
Growing up as a teenager, these guys go to work at the earliest opportunity.
It is hard, if you are ill in the knowledge of the tongue, they will confess.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that human rights advocates note one important point with regard to the Language Act.
Testing will only be carried out for those who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be neither an exam nor a subsequent official job.
Meanwhile, most of the gastrobyters still live in Russia illegal.
"Welcome, or the outside is not allowed."
Many of the visitors claim that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and still the same language difficulties.
Besides, legalization costs between 12 and 16,000 rubles.
But false registration can be done quickly and for only 1,500.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, hence cases of extortion.
"Percentage, two for cigarettes, tea," shared with the journalists a citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hashadamov.
"Give it, don't be shy, buy art."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that not only migration registration documents were false.
Several "lip" certificates for language testing have already been removed by the FMS.
Forged paper is printed on a normal colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get a good deal of it: each of the immigrants who had hoped to make it easier to pass the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as expensive as a formal test procedure: it will cost an employed migrant three thousand dollars.
The main challenge for the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the “crusts” cannot be simply bought, and authorities and human rights advocates alike will come together.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise the hostbytes, who have not been able to successfully pass the first test, a time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered jobs in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not trade illegal arms
The percentage of crimes with legal weapons is very low
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia suggests that the law on the ownership of civil weapons be tightened.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: pressing shots at weddings when no casualties occurred, and killing by Moscow's lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to ban the wearing of injuries in public places and raise the age from which to obtain a license for weapons, from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by Irina Yarowa, the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Cruption, and she promised that the arms law would be amended by the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "shuffling the hooks."
There was an open letter on the network, which, from various public small-scale organizations, demanded that the "unintelligible hardening" be abandoned.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, declared to the Russian BBC's criminal lawyer Basili Lesnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the six months of 2012, there were 142 crimes with a firearm registered with the internal affairs agencies, while in the same period there were 1,168 thousand recorded crimes.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of civil weapons legislation does not put the perpetrator on the black market.
Now, they say, you can find any weapon at a low price in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to be controlling the distribution of illegal weapons.
Vendors: from factories to officers
The black market for weapons is being expanded through several channels.
The main channels are five, says a retired colonel, Victor Baranets, who has spent ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a site that receives weapons orders
The first is an "armey or military footprint," a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were dragged both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranets.
The next kind of black weapon is stolen by criminals from members of the security forces.
The Barane explains that this includes both stolen from police stores and stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal stools are being sold from military stores.
Many military warehouses had frequent explosions.
"There is a proven theory that part of the arson attacks was made deliberately to cover the gap," said the former military.
According to Baranz, arms growers have contributed.
"Now there are private arms factories that fail to compete on the international market and throw weapons from the floor to the black market, including Moscow," the expert said.
Another source of the black market is trafficking.
There are particularly many guns and machine guns coming from poor countries, such as Kirgistan.
"There's production, sometimes handicrafts, and there's a mob that's organized the stream," the former military explains.
Where did the gun come from?
The experts estimated the estimated share of each source of illegal arms transfers to the black market.
A report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Design.
The experts examined the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and the public data of the weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, written by researchers, come from the army and the security agencies.
Half of all the weapons on the black market were found there “because of the officials whose work is related to the weapons” as described in the report.
According to researchers, 17% of the cases come from armed conflicts, 14% from weapons production, 5% from black archaeology.
The salesman of one of the arms stores, who asked me not to call his name, claims that the weapons found by black diggers have been out of business for a long time, too old.
Most often, he says, the salesmen are going to the military warehouse for a new party.
By means of a flagger, a person buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
They're letting him out, handing her over the fence.
"He transports it to town and here sells 900 euros a grand with two shops," he says.
"Truly, the police are aware of all cases, so periodically, when a crime solving plan is on fire, they make a control purchase from illegal arms dealers," adds the consultant.
"As in a fancy store."
The salesman and the customer often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at websites, blogs, until a friend responded, who offered to come to the Bogoway platform, where there'll be a man who'll take me to the corner where we'll trade.
The price of the gun was only there.
military observer Victor Baranets
To get a gun, I need a friend who has a way out, says a consulting salesman.
There are salesmen in the market, but there's a way to go, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanowitz, who asked me to tell her that the daughter had a tooth."
I'm getting a couple of shots right now through someone I'm sure of.
He only delivers them to me, too, because he knows I won't turn him in.
Newcomers are searching for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranets tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid 1990s when he was writing an article about it.
The schemes, he said, had not changed.
He was given an album with a picture of anything.
"I felt like I was in a fancy store," the military remembers.
The purchaser, according to Baranz, is not offered a cat in a bag -- anything can be tried.
I, a potential client, don't just buy -- we're going with a salesman to the woods, we're setting a target.
"I'm allowed to shoot, and when I find out that a weapon hits well, we start to trade," the expert describes the procedure.
A store on the couch
Internet search engines are uploaded to websites and groups in Vkontact, where they offer to buy weapons for "different purposes."
You don't need any documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain sum of money," writes in an advertisement cap on the website "Can you buy a gun or a machine gun?"
Users leave their applications and ask questions.
Are you going to sell them to minors?
"No license of course," asks the user Ivan (orthography saved).
"Cupule TT.Moscow" makes the request for "Fedorencs" neatly.
The Fed has now dispersed a huge network of front-sites that want to buy weapons with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish for food, and then they get coal in Siberia.

I've heard of these schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The purchaser pays through the ATM.
"The answer is a photograph and an instruction where the weapon is hidden," says Dmitri Kislov, a press secretary of the Public Organisation Right to Arms.
Victor Baranets claims that if you leave the application on the site, you can go without a gun and go to jail.
The Fed has now dispersed a huge network of front-sites that want to buy weapons with a shovel.
"People go like hungry fish for food, and then they get coal in Siberia," he claims.
100 Dollar Macau
It is estimated by experts that between $100 and $900 can be spent on the purchase of illegal small arms.
According to Dmitri Kislow of Right to Arms, Makarov's pistol is available for $100-300.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from the warehouses of the long-term storage by the management of these medium-level warehouses.
In the official state of affairs, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7 per cent from January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of reported incidents of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive devices and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the United States
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers work at MacDonald's.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food networks such as McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wandis and Kentucky Free Chicken.
As long as no one predicts whether this wave will turn into the ninth shaft, or whether it is intended to exhale at an early stage.
Actions support trade union and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages received by regular Walmart workers and the fast food system, the goal of the protesters is to set up trade union organizations in them.
So far, this sector of the economy is scarcely covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The stock broke out last week, after thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, when America was hit by an orgy of cheap sales, which seized millions of users and was sometimes accompanied by quarrels.
On that day, some Walmart employees, employing 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and picketted with trade unionists and left-wing activists a company whose product is calculated on people of modest and average wealth.
Walmart trades everything in the world, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in his shops are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
So many low-paying Walmart workers only stay at work.
Accessibility and product mix made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods cheaply partly because it pays its employees little.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions such as lack of truckers or hand scans.
The shareholders at Black Friday demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of corporate health insurance had jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
Typical Walmart employee, getting $9.5 an hour, this expense can't afford, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart raise the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost a corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1 percent more than she spends on wages now.
If Walmart puts the entire salary increase on the customer's shoulders, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
They'll spend some $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart's followers have rather remarked that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any damage to the corporation.
"Black Friday" went on in her shops from 8 p.m. Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart was selling about 5,000 goods per second.
A total of nearly 100 million transactions were made by its cashiers on "Black Friday".
The company's spokesperson, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview with Huffington Post's left site that the jobs were abandoned by a total of “less than five” Walmart employees, and that the protest was just a “ordinary piano trick” of the trade union that organized it.
"Free cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not targeted by the Walmart department (they are not welcome in this advanced city and therefore are not here yet), but by the McDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of pieces, and then he doesn't even give you sick and pays you for fair work!
Djumaine Williams, Councilman of New York
At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Quick food restaurants eventually increase it, but not much, and on average their regulars get $8.90 an hour in New York City.
Nobody earns less in this expensive town.
How can you live in New York with that kind of money, it's incredible to me.
There was once a quarter of American teenagers through the McDonalds who used to work on their counters after school while living with their parents.
Few have seen it as the main source of food or intended to stay there for a long time.
Now I constantly run into interviews with McDonald's employees, who complain that they should live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children on it.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal has a comment on it, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children unless you know what you're going to do to feed them.
The protesters, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning at McDonald's on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of the fast food system start paying at least 15 dollars an hour, i.e. more than doubled their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be set up in the area of fast food.
American law forbids the administration to prevent and punish trade union activists with harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But it is also difficult for a trade union to enjoy fast food for objective reasons.
One of the main things is the extraordinary movement of human beings.
Disagree
Noise protests took place this day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The event culminated in a midday rally at the McDonalds near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians spoke, including councillor Djumain Williams, who said, "McDonalds" says he's selling billions of meals, and then he won't even give you sick and pays you for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were supported by other prominent New York democrats, such as the candidate for the city's mayor, Bill De Blacio, who said that "we must stand by the fast food workers so that they can achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves."
As the New York Times described, this was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But there were only a few hundred people involved, and not all of them were workers in a fast-natured restaurant where tens of thousands of people were employed in New York.
It is not clear whether this spark will generate a flame of mass movement.
"Till fooling the brain gets medium."
The popular theme of modern technology has recently been perceived mainly through the lens of special points.
The current model was first shown by Google at its annual conference and later in November that Microsoft had applied for a patent.
However, the conversation with the leader of the 3D interactive technology team at the Cambridge Laboratory of Microsoft, Sharam Izadi, suggests that the pointer for the company's researchers is the stage.
They are enticed by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Tell me, please, in general terms, what's your research team doing?
- We're interacting with machines, but we're trying to spread the boundaries of that interaction.
While humanity's mass is stuck at the pixels stage on the flat screen, sometimes with a finger.
We want to look five to ten years ahead and predict a fundamental change in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox device and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost none of the Xboxes are sold without Kinect today, because everybody's interested in sign control.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Although Kinect has moved interaction to a physical level, a lot still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input has improved (the system receives more data) and the output is not very good yet.
We're trying to change that, we're working on really three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, make it more imaginable.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient way.
And above all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality hats!
- What do you think of voice management?
It's popular, but isn't it overrated?
- It's certainly not a panacea. It's a matter of privacy, because you don't always want to tell people about your actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everybody's in their own pockets.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project where we were thinking about gestures, but not about fuzzy ones, but about such stingy, short ones.
The gestures were taken not by the camera of the device, but by a handcuffed bracelet that fixed the movement of the bones and muscles.
So far it's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the watch.
But the future of a mixed type of administration, for example, a gesture-and-voice.
- What's that?
- For example, how will you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want users to adapt to what a car can or can't at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think we're going to have to work on the development of new sensors in the near future that will allow us to better measure human reactions.
It can be laser sensors, for example, they give a good resolution on the depth, it's very important.
- Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what's your problem with modern cameras?
Missing permission, depth or something?
- In principle, this generation is something that can be pushed away in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get mega-pixels 8 at 1000 k/s.
But it's not the megapeixel itself, it's the matrix and the depth.
From the last point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us, which adds work to algorithm designers.
So you have to remember not only the X and Y resolution, but the Z resolution.
Also, speed is very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are rather dynamic, and the current 30 k/s are quite scarce, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our Redmond lab made a sensor to touch with a controlled processing delay of between 1 and 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone knows how that affects human and machine interaction.
I could really use the equivalent of this device in my work, except that I don't need to touch it, that I have more frames per second.
- Don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
-Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other is the receiver of the reflected signal.
And that's the third camera, which is actually the normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A potentially larger number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or worsen it by increasing the amount of calculations required.
It would be nice to create a flexibility analogue to Kinect, to play with the curvature of the cameras, and to see how that would help in the three-dimensional definition of the position.
- As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present her glasses to the public.
Don't you think from the point of view of the daily use of advanced-real-size technology, it's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, it's not very comfortable to keep your smartphone up in your hands, but I think the coolest option would be "transient" added reality, when, based on cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smartphones, projection displays, and so on.
The glasses are a very personal device, in which their strength (the private things you only see) and at the same time the weakness -- the added reality based on the glasses will prevent you from working on virtual objects with other people.
Let's say for a moment that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Starck of "Iron Man," but also to a mortal.
There is one problem that is often highlighted by criticisms of such an idea: there is no tactful renunciation!
My hands don't feel anything!
What are your group's answers to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is the seventh biggest breakthrough in interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be adding tactile feelings.
Meanwhile, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a sort of substrate for the image.
She's got a great record of the push!
But there are also technologies that are really designed to give these "carts in the air" a touch -- for example, the interference of several directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located, gives you a feeling, but as long as it's very weak -- as if you've been blown on your pillows.
There are wrist bracelets that affect nerve endings in your fingertips, too.
- Have you tried to fool your brain?
Make him think that he feels what he's supposed to feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
There's another challenge that has to be addressed for a long time -- how to make a person physically in a very restricted space believe that he's going through open, almost infinite -- working on concepts of running tracks (not as in clubs), moving platforms, and huge balls.
As long as brain deceit is medium, work is still very long.
That's what makes the virtual reality so appealing to the researcher -- a lot of things in a completely infancy state.
The taste instead of culture is Rosbalt.ru
The "Rosbalt" project continues with the "Petersburg Avantgarde" project, dedicated to the citizens who are in the front, in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top-list has already been hit by the bright art scenes of Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often receiving recognition in Europe, rather than Russian popularity.
The new hero "Rosbalt" is an entertaining artist, Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man, dressed in all red clothes, who is found at the Russian Museum, then in the summer garden, then on fancy parties, and vernisiasces.
The paintings of Cyril Miller always gather crowds of viewers wherever they appear.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely peterburgan social philosophic storytellers who have created new mythology.
Cyril Miller is a bright man in the late '80s, early '90s.
Besides, he's a man of the city, with his appearance in the streets of a shining smile in the city that cheers everyone up.
Recently, he took over the squirrel and became a peterburgian squirrel because he was ripe for this complex role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
Cyril, why are you still walking around town in all red instead of yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I've chosen a red color as a designer with a view and an image.
In this world, red is a compromise between an artist, an imagemaker and a society.
Though in society everything that's a little gray is causing an agitation and arousal of a bad character.
But my motives are to start a conversation.
The whole history of my incisive actions is an invitation to discuss.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition in Nevski, where my work was exhibited.
I realized this was my way.
Then a wave of old informal artists passed, and new, free types of me were incomprehensible.
I began to be friends with the artists of the new wave, with the posthumousine that led to the Pushkin 10, and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into theatre, clothes, music, all genres except a word.
And it all came together in your Art-Clinic... and it was important for me to find myself in the center of the culture of Petersburg, where all the best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied the Territory on the Pushkin 10, and there, while there was no repair, there was a music-artist club, a bohemian club, and a home of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there, the NOMs, Tequila Jazz, and I remember the Snura being brought in with the Van Gogh ear project.
The cord and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, they were in a tight tight tight, among them was the fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became a Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the lead of many programs before the Cali-Galiban era.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went on, and he got basic education and education from us.
The D-137 Gallery, the Gryboedov Club, is an excerpt from the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and the regulars are gone.
I'm the hero of yesterday's age when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, and the prize was "The People of Our City."
In the "The Artist of the Year" nominating, I was named, and my climax was over.
In new times it's not comfortable to work under the old rules, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
It's easy to become popular in these years, but culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is a familiar manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they're highly relevant and acute.
I'm going to have a show, "The Russian Clown Museum."
Clowns are an extra-time category.
I used to be social, being like that now is painful and frightening.
But the clowns are smearing, the tragedy is lifted.
I love the Grotex, I have grand ideas.
For example, saving the world by totalitarian dressing in order of order.
Now they're meeting on clothes, focusing on external mechanics, not on the inside person.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and spit in the face.
And deceit will be removed by dressing.
- And recently, we saw you as a city ballerman.
Who else should I be?
- Maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be neat, tactful, sweet.
Cultures are disintegrated.
People used to fall into packs, the Bohemian liked one, the other.
Now everybody's crashed into a micro-community, and now it's hard for everyone to like.
I'm not a hundred-dollar paper that everybody likes.
Now you have to think about who you like.
Now, every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And at Stas Michael's comes a few thousand!
- He's got dumps, where the sex and social sphere works.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come, and 10,000 won't come, and eventually less management, money, everything will fade.
I have fans, and the thing is, I can't fool them, I can't ruin what I've got.
When I was a teenager, I wrote paintings like this that one collector had them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings that usually end.
Nowadays, they're often confused.
They say culture is spiritual, culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I'm a culture man of yesterday, grew up with examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, gave up money for painting.
I'm for this kind of culture.
Cyril, what's Petersburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this notion: an official from culture.
But not all of them can engage in culture.
In the case of the right kings, things were not like that, but the kings did not understand the culture very well, but they did realize that they needed to keep the right experts.
There's a good consultant in Moscow right now.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they're pushed away because they need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and give them a way.
Now the taste is flourishing.
The same Erarte, but they're different because they honestly say that not all modern art we take, there are artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is Petersburg to you?
-Petersburg isn't a cultural capital, Moscow has a lot more culture, there's soil.
And it's hard to grow art on our rocks.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers than readers right now, it's wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of thinness.
We need to make fashionable art, as it was at the beginning of last century.
Project implemented with St. Petersburg grant
Born in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with grounders on board are on their way to find an alternate planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question is, how can we continue our species under conditions of weightlessness or on the same reserve planet?
I don't think there's much of a choice.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be understood hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars," considered by Vladimir Surdin, a senior researcher at the P.C. Sternberg State Institute of astronomical Sciences (GAIS).
But if on Mars the conditions are more lifeable, then on the surface of Venus, the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in orbit of Venus... in space.
The way to approach matters of reproduction in space began with flora.
Half a century ago, they experimented with plants.
Four generations of in-orbit peas were no different from their earthly species.
Then, in orbit, insects, tiny fruit-drosophile flies.
In 1979, the quail eggs were sent into space to check how the embryo develops under conditions of weightlessness.
We get a perfectly normal bird out.
And then there's the problem.
"The problem of this bird's having to find a support, he's got to get up on his feet and start moving," explains the head of the Institute of Medical and Bio Problems (IMBP) RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
Without finding a stronghold, the birds sprang randomly.
And 10 hours later, babies had atrophy of instincts.
The birds did not react to the light or sound.
And there the trouble was, after four days, they just died.
"And twice we hunted out the birds, and then we refused, because it's just impossible to work with them there," notes the failure of the experiment with birds in space, Vladimir Sychev.
With animals, the last biological "minicocheg" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the Biosatellite "Bion" will have only same-sex persons.
There was an experiment with rats who had been sent to space already with the foetus.
Basically, there was nothing supernatural out there.
"It was just on biosatellites, but again -- it's a single experiment, and it's a research to do," observed Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the cosmic rats had offspring.
But we can't get to the problem of reproduction directly in space yet.
It's not a simple task.
Animals, by losing their habitable habitat, simply cannot exercise their sexual instincts.
A man, unlike beasts, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
No such experiments are carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Tereshka had the greatest risk.
And the most precious thing that humans have is a woman's body.
Our Cup flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if it would survive a flight into space.
Can she have a baby after this flight?
"Because no one answered this question," said the Vahtang Space Veteran.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight to space, Valentin Tereskov's first female cosmonaut gave birth to a daughter.
Andrian Nikolayev's father was also an astronaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savitski, a second female cosmonaut, was born in orbit twice and even in outer space.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have enough, there's a lot of spacemen who have been spared after long flights, and they're growing a healthy generation.
"And if there is more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia, Valery Polakov.
Yet, humanity needs to find some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, artificial gravity.
The CCP Hydro Lab is a mandatory flight preparation phase.
Here, in a situation of zero floating, astronauts are trained to work in outer space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for adult water, though comfortable, but still alien, for babies, it's natural.
The small ithianders seem to confirm that life on land has come out of the ocean.
There's a connection between having a baby for about nine months in my mom's occult fluid, and getting used to the water.
In principle, it makes sense, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bathing, it takes only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," said the teacher of the breast swimming of Marina Axenov.
In other words, if for a born child weightlessness is more natural, then for a woman, gravity is required, gravity is required.
Very quickly, in weightlessness, the abdomen, the pelvis, the ability to push the fetus out, erodes.
All right, let's put that down by relying on birth stimulators.
You can, of course, in a special cell go to the birth, she'll push him out.
"And then what?" asks the non-trivial questions of Valery Polakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the Earth's attraction, the body will not form a skeleton or a muscular system.
You can't wear a new baby in orbit as an adult into a special exercise suit.
He will simply be denied what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that you and I are going to do, by allowing a baby to be born in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring to Earth a disabled, totally disadapted person," predicts the head of the IMBP RAN Bioethics Committee, Igor Pestove.
As long as the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a while, it will be a reality when the Earthmen on their ships go to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Head of the General Audit Office: Checking the quartz system failed because of politicians.
In the public procurement industry, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the existence of quality legislation, its implementation is lagging behind.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview with Aktuáln.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we do not have enough," remarked Cal's current situation.
Such opinions provide a joint inspection of the Czech and German monitoring bodies.
As an example of bad practice, Peter's approach to the so-called squartz system is prompted.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the PDP (Civil Democratic Party) would not disturb employers with tests - is it prohibited or allowed?
“The law should be in any way established, and, if it forbids anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of institutions which are obliged to verify and enforce the obligation,” notes Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, comparing the laws on public purchases of both countries.
What exactly was the subject?
This is a parallel test that we started probably two years ago.
Simply put, the point of European law asserts how public purchases should take place is followed by national legislation and then also by application in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even with an unfinished check, there are interesting differences -- let's just say, the law can be "accurate and unmistakable," but in application practice, we are in some respects Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more sophisticated rules, but to focus on the application of the law itself.
And exactly how this project can help you, what does it mean to you?
It is precisely this joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarity of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
The economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enriching and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not a fact that we're going to achieve that by reducing the restrictions on orders.
This system may be filled with "paper" so that those who want to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the constraint hadn't decreased.
You're talking about internal problems in the practical application of public procurement laws.
And how does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization like our HRW (Control-audit) or does it work differently?
As far as institutions are concerned, our CRM is the Bundesrechtnungshof, which is based on our principle, and there is also a panel that works a little differently, but mostly both institutions work the same way.
Moreover, the powers are to a certain extent similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units at the federal level -- in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage government money, we have public funds.
Public foundations in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Courts of Accounts.
As far as local law is concerned, is it easier than ours?
Actually, I don't want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a sample, but it can't be said to be the best in anything.
Is that because they're better at controlling?
Absolutely not, but again, I don't like comparisons like that.
But it must be said that even model countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefit from cooperating with our office, right?
In the case of domestic law, what effect did the changes to the Public Purchasing Act have on your establishment have?
Given that the legal effect of these changes is rather short, it has not yet become apparent in our verification work.
Since we are monitoring the facts, some delay must be taken into account.
We've only taken this into account in the process of preparing future checks -- we've started using our new tool, "Detecting the risk of inefficiencies," through which we ran almost 14,000 government contracts -- and we've analyzed them, and that's where, of course, these changes will occur because of the changes in limitations, the changes in the conditions of some types of tender, etc.
Do you think the adoption of this law would be useful or would put an extra strain on the bureaucratic system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that might arise is that the rules are “hardened” and cannot be observed.
In the course of the previous rules, controlled businesses are associated with a provider (e.g. a regional operational programme - a regional council) that any failure to comply with the law on public purchases means a breach of budget discipline.
Should the law then be tightened in that way?
I don't think so.
The system should rule out those who want to capture and abuse, but should not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect a decision.
Such a system would only put even greater pressure on bureaucratic activity.
And then how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the DPP would not bother businessmen with the so-called swartz system.
Is the "Swarts System" prohibited or allowed?
The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibited anything, the Prime Minister could not resist the work of bodies which were obliged to verify and enforce their obligations.
You can say, "We'll change this law and we'll let it happen," but you can't say we're pretending nothing's happening.
The Public Purchasing Act contains rather strict rules, as and what should be formalized, and that's right, which will protect public purchases.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think is not enough.
Roads are slippery, but mostly passable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowed.
They're mostly passing through, but somewhere with more care.
Carlovar Province
There were passages this morning in the Carlovar edge of the road, but some frozen and snowy.
Temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but must warm a bit during the day.
The region's snowfall has stopped, only a small layer lies in the lowlands.
However, on the backs of the Ore Mountains lies about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information received from the district road workers it was reported that there was a lower visibility due to the fog.
The R6 highway and first-class roads in the region are now without restrictions.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be frozen and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third classes, including mountain routes, are passed.
However, some of their areas still contain frozen remains and frozen snow.
We need to be particularly attentive to the roads on the hills.
Pardubitski and Kralovegradetsk
The Czech Roads and Routes Authority, on its Internet pages, reports that some eastern Czech roads are threatened by a holoid, while mountains and highland roads may be affected by snow.
District roadworkers warn drivers of a holold who can be formed particularly on the hills of the Pardubitsk coast.
The hungry may be near Lanchcroun, Usti nad Orlice, Policika, Switavi or High Mito, especially on the second and third-class roads.
Roads I43 and I34 located at Sweetavi are treated with chemicals.
The snow lies especially on the roads of the Kkonoše and the Orlic Mountains.
The frozen snow layer is situated on roads situated on hills in the areas of Richnove-nad-Knenovo and Trutnov.
East Czechs today have a variable cloud without precipitation.
Temperature usually ranges from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Pilsenski
Roads in Plzen are passing this morning, but places need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
It's cold in the morning, temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and later cooling in some places, it may be slippery.
Drivers may encounter fog in places, but visibility will gradually improve.
Regional roadworkers provided information.
The D5 route is now almost unlimited, but road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most of the first-class roads have dry and extinct surfaces.
In southern Plzni and Tahove, frozen areas may fall.
Second- and third-class roads are wet, and in this case there is also a warning due to the possibility of slipping areas.
Drivers must be careful, especially on low-use roads in the region of Sumawa.
Olomousk edge
Drivers travelling on the hills of the Olomousk coast must now take into account the snowshare on the road.
It remained after the use of the chemicals in the Cervenogorian saddle and on the road towards the Svevyaky Krshij.
During the night the snow caused the roadworkers to go outside, according to the traffic control, about three inches of snow fell in the Schumperca.
In other parts of the road, there are generally no restrictions.
"On the hills of the Schumper lies the rest of the snow.
Drivers heading towards Jesenica must be aware of the presence of snow-crème in the Cervangorian saddle," the Czech News Agency informed today the manager of the Sumperk Road Management.
During the night they went to clear the roads and their colleagues from Jesenica, and they said that the roads on the hills after processing the chemicals were left bare and wet.
There are no restrictions on roads in Olomouc, but in Sternberg drivers must be attentive to forest areas where moisture is still present.
Austetsk edge, Liberian edge
This morning, road workers from North Bohemia report that there are some difficult passage points left.
According to the police database, in addition to several places with holold or snowed, a mountain road was closed on a section from Telnica in the Clinica of the Province of Utez.
The temperature is also negative in the lowlands, so there is still snow and ice on the roads, and the lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Middle Mountain, are, on the contrary, not a problem, the roads are mostly dry.
No traffic problems have been reported yet.
Road workers report the appearance of a holold in the vicinity of Steti.
According to meteorologists, the conditions for his formation at night were perfect: it rained all day long and melted snow, the night sky became clear and the freeze began.
Harmful conditions are reported on the main highway and on track I/13 on the border between the Province of East and the Province of Liberia.
The snow-shaped branches of trees affecting the road themselves forced them to close the road to the Telnica in the Book.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to generate positive energy
What do you think of the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we people are getting into so easily.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we constantly joke about this and say that we are the only group in the world that can generate enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you're going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Would you like to explain this to the readers?
This is a nationwide fund-raising exercise that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, the end of which was announced on December 21st at 11:10 p.m.
The day before this event, on December 20th, at 9 p.m., there are three parallel concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, frankly, when the Pacific Island of Kiribati, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than ours, completes the May calendar.
Who thought of that idea?
It was originally my idea, and then we all came up with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to generate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state of the world we will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of pieces of shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world, which you can buy at www.e-tap.cz, and thus also support us.
The Tap Tap band, along with other musicians, also performed an anthem against the end of the world called "The End of the World" .
Will the YouTube audience's favorite anthem be sounded at these beneficent concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if it turns out it's going to work and the end of the world doesn't come.
It'll be played by all performers at all concerts at once.
The hymns will also be broadcast live on Czech television.
Words for this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in Tomasz Hanak's video, participating also in the performance of Hindl X...
How did you start cooperating with them?
We also work with other people in Czech cultural life, as we host many charitable events and concerts.
We're trying to actively involve them in these projects.
It turns out that a lot of people like to work with us, they're interested.
What's the profit from a concert against the end of the world?
In order to buy equipment for a free education centre called STUDEO, we've been doing this for six years with a civil group called Tap at the Institute of Edlikki.
Teachers regularly attend school in the Yedlikki Institute and have fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves don't have the means to go to the teachers, and we're trying to give them that opportunity.
As part of a project to build an additional institution, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with this project.
There will be several musical groups and performers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We've tried to create a program that will interest all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, the Superport Lesbiens, Illustratosphere and Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Maryan Bango, and Irzy Sochi will perform.
All details are available at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “grandious events” in the future?
In May, we'll be performing for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival, and here, of course, we'll prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we'd love to have a presentation at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we're in the United States, would really like to make a presentation in Washington and Chicago.
You've had serious plans about abroad, you've already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with a disability.
How do you cope with the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks at first sight.
We've got five players on electric wheelchairs, their carriages are supposed to travel in the luggage room, plus all the lots of cargo and boxes of tools.
However, as long as we've managed it without problems, the Czech Airlines ÇSA and British British Airways have always been perfectly prepared for us, which has surprised me so many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently came from, everything went smoothly.
By travelling abroad, you can compare countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards disabled persons, etc.
What have you been up to now?
Since Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything works better than we do, we have seen in Russia that in the east we are still at the base level.
Compared to Prague, there are many barriers in Moscow, and here the independent movement of a person on an electric wheelchair in the centre of the city is still a wild thing.
Also there's no such trivial stuff as giving way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already social organizations that are trying to focus people's attention on the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, should we constantly catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to make it clear that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's perfectly normal that people with severe disability move on their own in the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It's not very common that a large number of people with special needs take an active part in public life, and that's where we're a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or freedom is one thing, but at the moment that we have famous sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians, or lawyers, things are really going to change.
So far, these are isolated cases of people with strong will.
The Tap Tap group is now very popular, but we'll go back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I went to the Yedlikki Institute as a teacher, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself and I'm playing a saxophone, I've organized an interesting music club with a colleague.
Well, in time, as our host Ladja Angelowicz says, it got a little out of hand (Laughter).
Has popularity come only in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It's true that it helped us to begin to join the famous singers and to work actively to propagate the group.
We have concluded that a job that no one can appreciate is essentially as if it didn't exist.
Thanks to the European Union, we can afford trained teachers, equipment, etc.
Was it your goal to turn The Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their potential to do something extraordinary.
Show business is full of things that follow each other.
It's logical, all new things are taken with care, and it's going on for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us is, of course, pity, it's natural...
But that pity is absolutely unnecessary, because people with limited capabilities are not some suffering and all the abandoned individuals we should pity.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disability are doing something, it's a shift not only for them, but for society as a whole.
Has it been a success that you are the strict leader that many think you are?
If we want to do a good job, we have to be in many ways uncompromising and maintain a certain degree of discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and fly in clouds, and when they find out they have to go to rehearsal twice a week, attend pre-schools and spend a lot of time on the road, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
At present there are 20 members of The Tap Tap.
How many were there in early 1998?
Only one Ladja Angelowicz.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have will and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.1212 at 9 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno at the Fléda Club and in Ostrava at the centre of Plinojem, with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are joined by a telemuseum at the time of the performance of The Tap Tap song "The End of the World" .
The aim of this project is to raise 25 million crowns of funding for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO Educational Centre at the Institute of Edlikki in Prague.
The concert ticket is 400 crowns, and the entrance is free for children under 12 years, and you can buy tickets at Bohemiatiket in advance.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern bloc (after Czech Republic, which became a full member of the European Space Agency on 12 September 2008).
Poland had begun close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and had been actively involved in a number of projects of the agency over the years.
But Poland's path to space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts had been travelling into space, but that was not always understood.
I would like to mention the lecture by A. Sternfeld, who presented ideas at the Warsaw astronomical observatory on 6 December 1933 from his innovative work "Introduce into Space."
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, and after a few years, Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltry and Andre Louis Hirsch's "Introduction to Space" prize.
Dr. Jan of Gadom (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great activist in astronomy and space science.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadovski became a famous world space propagandist, and his contribution was appreciated, including the fact that one of the craters on the back of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925 a rail train was built in Poland with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as did the details of the project.
It is not clear whether a rocket was to be used to disperse or to stop the cart.
Information about this is only available from the press of that era.
From 1933 onward, Polish shelling began to think about rockets.
The study was carried out by the Arms Technology Section, in collaboration with professors Mjeislaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokjitski.
The remaining material shows that the studies have reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the German troops coming, the work was interrupted.
In 1937 the idea of a photovoltaic fighter rocket was introduced into the specialized press, as suggested by the engineer of Rogozinski, and the following year the work of the author's "Air Torpedo rocket and an aircraft bomb" was launched by Lelili-Kivoblotski.
Both projects were designed for the military use of rocket engines.
Before the war, the Temporary Scientific and Consulting Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work, was involved in all military missile applications.
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of operation the work ended due to the beginning of the war.
The next scientific work on space has appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Space Sciences (Polskie Towerzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the issue of society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of The Problems magazine, which publishes four extensive articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotowicz offered to organize a space society.
At the time, artificial satellite projects were already on the rise, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Space Sciences (SPA) has tried to join the international astronautic Federation (established in 1951), and it has become a valid member since the fall.
And the following year, the first president of the PAA, Cazirez Zarankevich (1902-1959) became the vice-chairman of the International Federation of Space Sciences.
He remained in that position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 the PAA has made a significant contribution to the development of the very successful RM weather rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed on October 10, 1958, and the first type of RM-1 was completed on October 10, 1958.
The rocket, capable of reaching a distance of 1,800 metres, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of RM-1A was built and a two-stage RM-2 rocket was tested on the Bledovsk Desert in the summer of59.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to do real scientific work -- the RM-34 rocket could have crossed 14.5 km and its mission was to monitor the high wind.
But in 1962, further development was halted.
The first rocket of the RM type was a meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types have been developed (known as Methyleneor-1A, -1B and -1C) and have been different in size for scientific equipment.
The MOU-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 litres, MOU-1B 0.34 litres and MOUER-1C 0.62L.
The maximum flight range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Institute of Air Operations developed a meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2, with a 380 kg launch weight, was able to produce a useful 10 kg load about 60 km high.
This was followed by Methyl-2N and Methyl-3 versions.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to COSPAR (Space Research Committee) in 1960 and the establishment of a national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, under the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermashzewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Abolishing the law on public works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court revoked the Public Work Act.
The decree triggered a lively debate in society.
It would certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic entities, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is linked to the principle of free trade and free, unlimited private capital flows, together with unbridled financial speculation.
A large difference in labour costs (wages) results in price stress.
By this concept, it is necessary to understand the condition of the manufacturer, by delivering cheap goods, trying to resist economic competition by reducing the value of a competitor in order to take up most of the market and thus increase his own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most employers either moving production abroad, cheap purchases abroad, or disappearing; as a result, employment is rising in countries where labour costs are higher than others.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility, including for the work that it has done, there is an increase in the State's inevitable social spending.
Generally speaking, the situation increases the unwillingness of business owners to pay taxes and thus compensates for the social economic and social damage caused by them in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
Uncertain private capital methods create situations at the level of individual economies where national governments have to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their populations in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are putting their own people aside for private capital, despite social decline.
This is reflected above all in the changes to existing legislation.
The goal is to make their people comply economically with the dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic compulsion in the event of long-term employment, while at the same time serving as a means of reducing the rights of workers in labour law.
As a result, poverty and the difference between the poor and the rich are rising.
For several years now, the FGD has had a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As part of the improvement of the competitive position of the German economy, there are constant instances in which employed people get paid so that the State should pay them extra money to earn the minimum living.
Such a scandal had become known to the public in the case of the extra employees of the Bondestague.
Economic measures in almost all of the southern EU States undoubtedly result in the same situation in which people under the pressure of a catastrophe in social status are forced either to migrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to live on a low wage at the back of society in the hope that private investment capital will ever come into the country.
However, the question is, where would it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it won't come at all, because Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African, and other Africans are still working for European wages.
This applies to Latin America as a whole.
The liberal theory and media have argued, before it is nausea, that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, which is the result of an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the government should not interfere with the economy.
The next question to answer is, is not private capital now practically managing politics and the whole State, for its own selfish purposes?
The clear answer is yes.
The existence of almost all-powerful and universal lobbying in all States is proof.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation in corruption, mutual benefit, and in legislation where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In the USG, government government departments, due to a lack of financial resources, have assigned draft laws to private legal companies that are closely associated with industry.
These bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the constitution of the Western type states, but from financial and powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is evident that a liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly being put into a situation as described by Appian in "The Roman Empire crisis in the days of Cesar and Pompeius": "The state has long collapsed, and agencies are engaged in violence.
Bribery, illegal receipt of grace with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any ban, and people went to elections with a pre-sold voice." ...the right people did not run for the position of ruler at all, eventually one day the State was left without a  Consul for eight months." "The only saving in this terrible situation was self-government and the need to choose an energetic man."
As in ancient times, today's society predominates its own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital is no longer intended for public use.
The present result is no different from the past: the unparalleled decline of the elite without any effort to carry out deeper reforms.
So the reason for the emergence of fascist and communist regimes is that we must look into the recklessly loosening of economic systems for the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy can be seen as a certain pause after which the next round is expected.
Above all, it is tragic that the present elite completely ignores the consequences of the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are witnessing now, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The lifting of the law on public works is not a decision, or at least not forever.
Under pressure from competition at both the international and the national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be obliged to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
Thus, this tendency is systemic.
The solution was targeted political and social reforms that would enhance State ownership of the economy, enhance the role of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: The Chaos Laboratory.
"There's no way out of violence, and there's no way to get out of it." Sting, a song called "Smooth," where the main verse of refren is "we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons hadn't wanted war, they wouldn't have been"--the dying Gutel Schnapper, the wife of Meyer Amchel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, generated many reactions.
Some support Israel by arguing that it has the right to defend itself, while the Palestinian people act as terrorists, others support the Palestinian people by arguing for the racism of the Israeli State, for the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and for the State of Israel to be attributed to the role of a terrorist State.
I don't want to think about who in these recurring waves of murder is a criminal, and who the victim, after all, of today's citizens, including self-governed areas, was born at the moment of the current political situation, and who has not witnessed the beginning of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to see who is particularly affected by the 95-year-old strain (from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small part of the Middle East.
Some of my reasonings are backed up by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main engine of modern history.
Human history is above all a history of power struggle.
In every age we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps, or whether their throne has been followed by someone who has guided their actions to predetermined goals.
It must be assumed that we live in a period when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several persons, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not take place in a single generation.
One of the astronomically wealthy families is one that could be seen as a stoop-head (I don't know if anybody's standing over them, but it's not excluded) - the Rothschilds.
There's not much to write about.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they had bought in the 1990s to stop rumours linking their name to criminal actions in the higher areas in whose shadow they were, and which had always led to their power-building, an increase in wealth or both.
They have large shares in almost all the world's central banks, and against countries in whose central banks they have no share, they lead or prepare a war (there were only seven countries before the invasion of Afghanistan; after the invasion of Iraq there were five countries, there were only four countries left, but at the same time the Russian government took over the central bank of its country).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of a central bank in Rothschild Bank of America, and during the civil war he began to release his own (ponima, government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theatre.
John F. F. J. began issuing his own money, and he wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve System) and was killed in 1963, and the MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for launching the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their yearning for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to a plan for three world wars, created by the Great Masson of the 33rd level, Albert Pike.
The goal of the first war was the destruction of the monarchic states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonization, especially of Britain, and the third was to reduce the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion (the number of slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury and they would not consume much resources), to create a single universal religion (ecumenism could not be anything but a precondition for such a project) and to finally seize absolute power.
The method used by a group of the richest families led by the Rotschilds is to challenge the crisis and then suggest solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a worse situation (see the foundation of the FED, which should have prevented the recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash the First World War by killing the Heir of the Austrian-Hungarian throne, Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia by beginning the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended with a sudden, unwarranted military and economic surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for a war to destroy the royal Russia) and as a result the Central European Power, Austria-Hungarian, was crushed.
To ease the eruption of the Second World War, bankers and politicians had created a hidden conflict situation by imposing huge military sanctions on Germany, which had created the precondition for radicalizing the poor masses, and then had to give the Germans a strong enough one to blame the guilty and to offer simple decisions by the Chief, to continue to create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and had indeed played the role of a fifth column, in fomenting the fire of war.
In the late 19th century, the Rotschilds triggered the foundation of a Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish State, preferably in the area of history of the Jewish Union with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour declaration had created a precondition for the massive immigration of the Jews into Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population had begun.
The terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it is difficult to see whether Hitler broke out of the chains in which he was originally held by the bankers, or what he had planned, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the preconditions for the recognition of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by the military reparations of the Second World War, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a hotbed of war for the third.
If international bankers manage to untie it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will be the victims of fighting on the frontline, now with the Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslims of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (to only sway the sharp division of people into Israel's protagonists and opponents).
Who is responsible for, and who is the victim of, the Palestinian-Israel conflict, where resentment results in an endless cycle of violence, if it starts with the greed of individuals and their quest for world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we do, international bankers are putting people on the stand to vote for their own candidates only.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, the Netanyahu hawk, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international banker politician who is doing everything he can to launch a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to turn into a world conflict, and, given Iran's control over the Ormus Strait, which contains 20 per cent of the world's oil reserves (the corridor is only two miles wide) will also destroy the world economy.
In what light are the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will embrace a new world order."
The new world order in their vision is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population is a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every born body is injected with a chip, with which it becomes a creature under total control.
"And makes all small and large, rich and poor, free and slave to have on his right hand or on his forehead a brand, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast, or by the number of his name, can neither buy nor sell.
That's the wisdom: everyone with intelligence can calculate the number of beasts.
For it matches a human name, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
"Operation Argo: When worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a crowd of Islamist Demonstrant students took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomatic hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the demolished Shah, Mohammed Reza Pechlevi, who had fled after the US revolution, who had been the maintainer of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, it did not expect a positive outcome -- it could not afford to throw a check overboard because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the image of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
Detainees were finally released 444 days later, after negotiation with the Government of Algeria.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranism at home.
The fall in Iran has greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 Presidential elections, which ended with the election of Ronald Regan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that led to America's small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six employees managed to escape.
After difficult periods, they completed their journey at the Canadian Embassadorial.
The ClA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to extract them from Iran, and helped with an extravagant cover story, according to which they were travelling on Canadian passports as members of a survey team who were searching the country for a place to shoot a science-fiction epoch.
Genre Combination
The plan that Tony Mendez's "evacuation" expert invented required Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the story sound, specialized magazines had written about the film project, press conference was held, and a fictional manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Mendez's memoirs.
Aphlec's film is a special combination of a few genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called movie-kino-opus, the story of a successful idea, the scam -- an example might be a series of movies about Ocean's friends.
The film is constantly changing -- on the one hand, well-documented scenes from Tehran (the title shows symbolic historical images of events and how the same situations were shown in the film -- there is no big difference).
On the other hand, the lightened Hollywood passages overlap with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the walls from the ClA and other institutions -- men in costumes are talking about the situation at the desks, at the staircases of the institutions, on the phone...
Ben Afflec had a wonderful success in resuming his career.
From the ridiculed actor he became a respected director, and his game was no longer the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third full-length film, after a dark detective named "Good-bye, baby, good-bye" 2007 and a triller named "The City".
At the same time, it is the first film to be filmed in the hometown of the director, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place is one of the qualities that raised earlier film directors above the Hollywood standard.
And Afflec shows it in Argo, where Tehran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film occur in the streets, when real events are rebuilt -- the opening scenes of the fall of the embassy are astonishing by their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unexpected events that occur when history suddenly changes.
Affeck and his colleagues have a similar effect in the scenes of imaginary (forged office at the Tehran market).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that narratives do not involve many exciting scenes of film importance.
He works pretty well with this little, sometimes he's thinking something about it -- it's not all so elegant in there (the scene in which a telephone call in America prevents an imminent crisis at Tehran airport, and the chase at the runway looks rather preposterous).
Argo's disadvantage is the confusion associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they're not the only ones in the film.
Afflec's film lacks a bit of drama, and it's a film that you can watch with a moderate interest, considering the performance and the backwards style that recreates the 70s' thrillers.
But it's hard to catch up.
However, this is enough to remind you of one, still in a certain sense of living history, and to show how the notions of powerful and all-encompassing intelligence services are exaggerated.
Rules for balloon blowing, bananas and the circus
The website www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual survey on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd decree or project from the EU workshop".
"We are prompted by the latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies," said the "Right" organizer Patrick Nager.
Among the absurdities that have already been nominated is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of insurance contributions for men and women.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because they are objectively less vulnerable to risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place until the end of February 2013,' said Nager.
EU dispute orders include, for example, the requirement to add biocomponents to fuel, resulting in damage to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or a Directive on the size of a hen cell, which has caused significant loss of eggs this year.
The actual ban on the use of the term "butter oil" or the removal from the sale of classic light bulbs was also criticized.
Quality bananas must be 14 cm long.
The Pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by a State or a group of States (in this way the Czech Republic now, even under threat of a branch, defends the demands of its banks).
The lobby's interests are this: for example, the European Union's top-quality bananas were to reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to display an anomalous curvature.
At the same time, the European Commission was justified by merely aligning existing scattered national rules that made trade more difficult.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, had nevertheless eased the standards for fruit and vegetables, citing the fact that existing policies would lead to product waste.
The EU resolution last year, according to which sold balloons must be supplied with a warning that children under eight years of age cannot inflate them without adult care.
The EU has turned to American research, according to which balloons in the game are the potential cause of death by asphyxiation.
This limitation now applies to children under the age of 14, who are prohibited from blowing into fairy tales.
Funny ideas are born at home too
The rule concerning European officials itself is rather absurd: anyone who holds any official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitive nature of the subject for Greece, use the name Macedonia, but should instead say "BURM" (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com portal, in collaboration with the Laisez Faire, a group of liberal economists, has proposed for voting, in addition to the above-mentioned absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the size of food stocks in a member State.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food that may be stored on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day it joins the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the installed levels of preservative mushrooms, for which it was liable to a heavy fine.
The authors of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea and the idea of granting subsidies for applications for subsidies.
But these ideas came from Prague, not from Brussels.
"We are in a disadvantage because we have no sea.
Let's ask the European Union for compensation," said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas, in the fall of 2004.
He argued that there was a high crop of grain in the country and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the State had full stocks which needed to be removed.
For being far from the ports in the Czech Republic, the EU, according to Palas, should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic by arranging a tender for the purchase of seeds from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for a grant were offered to villages by the Ministry for Regional Development, led by the Minister of State, Paul Germans (US-DEU), in particular, to apply for a grant from Brussels.
EU: Amazing orders are exceptions
While regulations in member States are easily subject to criticism, EU regulatory efforts, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the European Union, are seen by many experts as worthy of more recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is to draw EU subsidies on projects that do not even suggest anything in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member States have achieved during the budget discussion.
It is the emotion of the Czechs that, like other European Union countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to identify its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians, have kept the name "Olomoutsky cheeses," but "Tumean rum," whose traditions are rooted in the 19th century, our producers were to be renamed "Tuzemak."
Only can be called rum, not sugar beet can be called cane distillate.
The official list of registered EU products, along with the world-famous “feta” and “horgonzola” cheeses, a German Lubeck marzipane or parmian ham, has already found, for example, Carlowarian sugars, a Gorgelic and Trichebon carp and a hunter ham.
The European Union's trademark can also be proud of the Pardubian carrots and the Gorzy pipes.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does it come to a man to run for president?
I don't think about being a senator or president myself.
If things were going smoothly in our country, I wouldn't run anywhere.
But I can't watch the country break up in the last 20 years, the way thieves fight, people raise their taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to find a way to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and I'm an independent non-partisan, I have no other opportunity to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You hit the senate, but soon went to the Presidential Castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I kept saying I'd fight for the Presidential Castle depending on the result of the senatorial elections.
I later specified that if I were elected Senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not to be a position, a position is a tool by which I can exercise my views.
So I need the greatest influence and broadest authority.
But the problem is not only that we're a nation that's spooning at our own bar or at the TV, but that we're ready to trample on anyone who tries to change things.
Adding to this is media that stigmatizes people and confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, I was told that I was bribed to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Irgi Paroubec.
Let's get to your views.
You have begun the struggle for the Presidential Castle with messages about political responsibility and criminal responsibility and property returns worth over twenty million.
To do so, the law must be changed.
You don't have that power as president, and only the entire senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I lobbied as a citizen to make the guided tours a free business, it was advanced.
The problem is politics -- when someone comes with a good offer on the left or on the right, they deliberately take obstacles, and it deters citizens.
As an independent, non-party man, I have a much greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what's best for our country without the party's shelfing, without looking back at the dogmats, and apply it.
Do you think you're more right-hand or left-handed?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that I'm more of a left person.
It doesn't matter to me at all, a little left or a little right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not about someone on the right, it's about someone on the left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good public decision whether it is offered by the HRCM or the HPD, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some perfect goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
You can call it populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already in operation in the world, or are spoken of by prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you'll only have a motif.
And with that you won't last long in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out and talk to people, you will be able to exercise criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another opportunity.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to their side so that we can get what we want.
If I had been elected President, there would have been no problem in arranging a live television broadcast in which I would call upon the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legitimize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they'll have to tell you why they don't want to.
If there is a strong person who speaks of abuse, it will be possible to exert pressure on the political scene.
Take a direct election to the president, it was a public pressure.
I say directly that I'm an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies to resist my beliefs and views.
I'm just beginning in politics, and for my program I'll try to get majority support.
I'm trying to move things on my own; if it doesn't work, I'll be done in six years and I'll be back in the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm the only one who won't do anything, so I beat a number of famous people with an offer to run for the senate.
I went to Radim Janchure, he refused due to a lot of work.
I also supported at least the leading research journalist Jan Lorentsov, who discovered fraud with light oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel like I'm on the weights.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections, and most of those who went to the university chose to vote.
There are only two of us independent in the senate.
People have chosen the senate so that the changes will be difficult to implement.
However, I will fight for my views, for example for direct elections to mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about the foundation of your own party?
I haven't thought about that yet, because I don't have time to check the cleanliness of every potential supporter's past, and I don't have the money for it.
There's no money for the Presidential campaign, and my transparent account is only twenty thousand crowns.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property returns, and what's the status of your own business with this?
Personal property is estimated at about 60 million.
I have a site in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, an art collection of about 10 million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb for a million, and a few more millions on the account.
By the way, Aston-Martin came up because it was my boy's dream -- I always liked James Bond, who drove, was gallant with women, and at the same time fought against vileness and lawlessness.
You drive to Aston Martin, you own 60 million dollars of property and you don't have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very persuasive.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Am I supposed to get into debt?
I've invested 2.5 million dollars in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign from my pocket.
The campaign costs will actually cover my senatorial salary.
But I wouldn't live with that money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run anywhere.
So you're going to be doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to cut it down?
But it doesn't depend on wages.
As I have promised, I have partially reduced my activity.
For example, my deputy will be managing a travel agency in spring.
People would want me to be the shabby one who'll keep the Republic.
But I need to live on something, too.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to getting monthly?
From 200 to 400 grand, which is what I'm getting.
And if I had become president, I'd have finished my business.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday issue of the newspaper The Truth.
MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not just in the imagination -- in the case of Spikeness and its recently built Book Mountain -- two photos.
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, at last we can see something interesting again," said Lizette Verheim, passing on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in a nearby large company, says, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we need another library today?
Everybody has Internet, iPad, and electronic books.
Nobody goes to such old-fashioned libraries anymore, right?
The Spanishissé, a small-sighted sleeping-town under the city of Rutterdam, owns an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate circumstance, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven fictitious bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of painted miniatures of iron beton.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And then the city's fathers realized that they had the only way to beat the statistics: build a library here!
Vini Maas, a master of bold column charts and author of witty, sometimes even cynical structures, took up the challenge with his usual complacency and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and a grin on his face.
And while the jury looked round and shrugged their shoulders, the daring Maas folded out of his original gift a pyramid of size and completed his speech in defence of his project with the words, "Dear citizens!"
Here's my offer: "The Book Mountain" in Speichenis, so-called Bookenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, grew.
It is part of the revitalisation project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and several surrounding houses and a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the "Bloody Mountain" was the second prize of the 2012 Best Library of the Netherlands.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch national woodwork competition.
Thus, a faceless suburb that had never been able to offer anything but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town town whose white facades suggest a milk plant has become richer on one modern piece of architecture.
But most importantly, there's the first cultural public building in the history of this town.
Long Road to Book
First impression: book Eldorado under a cheese cap.
There's only one elevator in the middle of the mountain, because true architects and readers would prefer to explore this area on foot.
The glassed room on all sides is a light and easily visible, baked brick floor and elegant street lights unmistakably create a sense of public town square.
The urban environment is restored perfectly.
The look is unwittingly searching for bench, dog, and soccer-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere -- books, books, books.
"The usual bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle lies a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless," says Vinnie Maas.
We put the classic configuration of space on our head and pulled out the area to read from the outside.
The internal area of the book mountain was well used: offices, Internet library, chess club, environment centre and technical facilities are located in the centre.
The black bookshelves, which are used to trim walls, parapets, and staircases, are particularly refreshing.
Their appearance, texture, and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and engineers are lost in guessing what sort of unknown material this is.
"We were trying to work with secondary materials," explained Jop Trauborst, a project manager representing the community of Speichenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once at a single farm in Frisland, we met a suitable by-product of farming.
For many years in the warmth and fields in the Netherlands, artificial fibrous material of millimetre thickness has been used as a stowage under its roots.
It's cheap and it saves time.
The thin textile serves one or two seasons and can then be discarded.
For the library, this canvas -- for the first time in such a volume -- was compressed into a panel four inches thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called landbauplastics (KLP) turns into dark, homogeneous, solid material, smelling a bit like a new car and a little sneaker.
There are 105 steps to the top.
One who crosses the path of nearly 500 meters will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and wood chips in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all about the right humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
New soul costs
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model project in terms of the environment," says the Troubhorst.
The heat of the ground is used to heat and cool it.
Though the Book Mount is under a glass cap, even on clear days, the sun will only come in for a short while.
Large wooden farms, located perpendicularly to the glass facade, provide shade and take over most of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very nice.
Full automatic roll curtains provide the rest of the protection.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above by the IT scepticist, has already visited a new library.
Lisette Verhig was here too.
And also a traditional Chinese medicine teacher, Cynthia Bohard, who called Bukenberg "the soul of the Spikeness, who has long been missing."
The reason is that a few weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to donate one book from his own congregation.
These books were supposed to take empty spaces on the shelves of an unfulfilled library -- at that point there were 70,000 books in it.
The idea worked.
The shelves are set to the top.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says the architect Vinnie Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, every inhabitant is now in some way connected to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration.
So MVRDV managed to solve a royal task called identity creation in a professional jargon.
Spikeness wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's only the starting point for building identity.
Sabo: "The Germans must play a more important role."
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, the US-European liaison expert, in doing so, is balancing the narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany first indicated that it would vote against the Palestinian application for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin refrained from voting.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany must now be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the United States position is not supported either.
Germany wanted to show its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the insurgency in Libya in March 2011, Germany also refrained from voting to establish a no-fly zone.
As a result, the offer was made by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, that is, moving from the policy that the US was, to the German foreign policy itself.
The situation is compounded by the fact that Europeans do not have a coordinated single policy.
So the Germans are getting back between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to it.
I think they're just finding out what they're doing, but they're on their way to a more normal foreign policy.
A foreign policy like that of France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It is a willingness to take a national stand independent of the position of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, export and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are very different from those of other major States, and therefore Germany must defend its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It therefore needed to be careful not to insult the public and elite in the Arab countries.
Anyway, it plays a role.
But I wouldn't attach too much importance to it; it's not entirely one-sided.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German calculations.
Has Germany damaged its relationship with the US by refraining from making important decisions, such as the Palestinian vote?
I am sure that in Europe, and even in the US, there is a prevailing understanding of the German position.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan question.
Germany might even thus gain some respect.
That signaled that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international scene and that its interests should be taken into account.
Europe has different views on the Palestinian initiative.
On the contrary, the US has made clear its support for the veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the US and many European States?
Because of American domestic policies, such differences have always existed.
I believe that Obama's government, deep down, has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But, of course, because of the local political situation, the government cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that considerable differences of opinion are not as significant as ever.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all excited about Netanyahu's politics.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the EU's most important partner on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, Germans would have been a little easier if there were a single, uncontroversial European policy, but that's not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and must instead act on the basis of their own vision.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in shaping a common European position.
It is clear that this is difficult for Germany, at least because of its connections to Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, won't it really take the lead?
Or does Germany still have a hard lead role to play?
Germany is not accustomed to this; it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, always hard to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis -- every time Germany takes on an important role, a wide range of anti-German feelings emerge.
The Germans don't just deal with it.
In fact, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must take into account a wide range of neighbours and opinions, which is not easy.
So the US's influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at present the EU is not filling this vacuum, so who is left?
The Germans will just have to play a larger role.
Even if you don't like it, it makes you uncomfortable or unloved, that's life!

"Protection of trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous trade mark, Polo Ralph Laurent is also.
But what is Armani Polo?
It's a perfectly officially registered name in China that has nothing to do with the companies from which it is created.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names have sued.
It is also not clear whether they will be able to assert their rights.
"Foreigners are getting harder to defend their trademarks in China," said Thomas Pattloh, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing, specializing in trademark infringements in the Far East.
On my desk every week he appears in a new case of this sort.
Simulaters only add a couple of letters to be able to register their trademarks.
So Gucci produces Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way German companies, such as the Puma manufacturer, are legally copied.
Pattlock opens a catalogue with records of the Department of Trademark Registration in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered a trademark named Zegna DF Puma, which also uses the name of the fancy Ermenegildo Siegna house.
The Chinese are the world's champions in copying and breaking intellectual property rights.
There are multi-storey stores in big cities that sell almost exclusively forgery.
However, Pattloh's cases are not the same; on the instructions of his confidants, he is opposed to the fact that Chinese companies are officially authorized by the Trademark Registration Authority to use a name which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it a Ban Minpai, a stamp passenger.
This word is associated with a "Bank docuan."
That's what women call hunting for rich men.
Chinese authorities do not confess guilt
"It damages business, it needs to be combated," Pattlock is convinced.
"The trade mark is blurred, the unique position is lost, the image is severely affected."
Financial losses and transaction costs in affected sectors are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods, with a sales volume of 15 billion euros a year.
However, it is difficult and expensive to remove dubious entries in the trademark register.
The process can last up to nine years, with an uncertain result.
Pattlock speaks of cases in which the court dismissed the suits, as after a long time the protested name became a "market reality".
If the plaintiff is not lucky, he'll even have to pay the plagiator because he's damaged his trade mark in China, says Pattlock.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous graphical cases.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction car manufacturer Sany, a company that had recently acquired a Putzmeister concrete-sucker company.
So the Chinese still have the right to use a logo that looks like amercedes star.
The Volvo company Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo that looked like BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste manufacturer lost to Hong Kong and Singapore simulators in China, where the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities don't think they're guilty.
The CTMO Trademark Registration Authority in Beijing confirmed that there were difficulties in 2010 due to a shortage of staff and equipment.
But last year there was "return from emergency to normal."
Thus, the number of pending objections cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 cases were closed, an increase of 75 per cent over the previous year.
However, 81.500 claims are still pending with the agency.
Fighting It Is Costy
As is often the case in China, the numbers are striking.
Last year CTMO received over 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China has, for the tenth consecutive time, led a list of new registrations worldwide, reports the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million.
A total of 1.8 billion yuan was paid in 2011.
Simplify this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Protesting it is worth many times more, as the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg shows.
For over seven years, the firm has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarism.
The Germans succeeded in putting an end to the illegal production of counterfeit car parts.
However, the simulator reserved Chinese rights to the Freedenberg trademark.
This was a personal failure because the names in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And CTMO's trademark registration office rejected Munich's claim.
True, in both of the following instances the Freudenberg won, but the enemy continues to struggle until now.
You have to be alert.
The matter is currently before the Supreme Court.
The Ventzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and lauds the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and it takes us a lot of time, money, and nerve."
Internal costs are hardly accounting, and the firm's archives have had to look at even acts of a hundred years ago in order to produce evidence.
Five years ago, Fredenberg unsuccessfully offered the opponent a “greater six-digit euro” for a settlement.
"It's clear from here how much it costs us," said Venzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
It is precisely if simulators register unprotected trademarks there.
So a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Fredenberg for shoes and leather.
The concert had long ceased production in those areas, but had nevertheless prevented registration.
"We need to be careful," said Ventsler.
Both he and Pattlock's lawyer recommend that German companies be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark protection; rather, aliens should “anything that should be protected, registered also in China”, says Venzler.
Otherwise, it might cost a lot more than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposite party license fees for his own name, explains Ventsler.
Otherwise, we will be banished from the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: trampling, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, Imbongi's chorus is rehearsing -- and in Swaziland, the orphans of AIDS are happy about it.
The history of a relationship that has travelled more than 8,733 miles.
First, a flooding occurs: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, women's boats, and men's boots pick up tactics on the floor and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of singers slowly grow -- alt, bass, tennis and soprano -- they come, enchant and follow each other.
And Fyte Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost springs out of his shoes when he carries them with a flexibly and expressive gesture.
Monday night, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Glee Club of Imbongi is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty members from 23 to 69 years of age attended the rehearsal, from a specialist in human genetics to a janitor.
"Om Obani" is a difficult thing, every voice in the chorus has its own text, and it's also in a completely foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and some parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
Unaids estimates that there are about 34 million people living with HIV in the world.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 orphans.
However, over 40 per cent of the population is HIV positive.
For 180 orphans in the village of Eszitgen, Voices for Africa found chiefs in Germany.
Of these, 70 attend school that prepares for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take over the heads.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot dinner at Gogo Center.
Imbongi in Zulu means storyteller or admirer.
In this hall they don't speak fluently on the bantu, but they can sing.
For nearly ten years the chorus learns songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally even brings them back to where they first appeared: southern Africa.
After all, there is a village of Eszitgeni, which depends on the voices of the German chorus, at a distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northwest of Swaziland.
Forty per cent infection rate
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple huts of clay and straw, among the inhabitants many children.
More than 300 of them had lost their parents who had died of the HlV virus.
In Esytgen, the disease of Swaziland as a whole is reflected in a miniature: the highest rate of HIV infection, and the world's lowest life expectancy, as reported by UNICEF.
The circumcision of men's extreme flesh, which proves to reduce the risk of infection by half, is scarcely accepted among the population.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland's population has a effluent virus in them, and death at the middle of the fourth decade is not rare.
The Glee Club opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants saw a large number of children on the streets, who needed not only parenting but also just everything: food, clothes, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first it was a private obligation of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send a child to school and to give him the opportunity to get hot meals once a day.
But a year later, the chorus founded a group called Voices for Africa, which has since almost professionally cared for the orphans in Esitgeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the major sexually transmitted diseases?
Syphilis, chlamydia, and tripper (gonoria) are considered to be microbial STDs.
HIV, human papilloma virus, genetic herpes and Hepatitis are common viruses.
Frontal lice and scabies are considered to be parasite STDs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mostly found in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that in at least four of the five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infection, trichomoniasis, candidose (grib), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infection is much more prevalent than among other population groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
We also have human papilloma virus among our youth.
How does the incidence of infection change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are required to be registered.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,300 cases.
This is about one tenth less than the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the area of genetics, complaints during urination, excrement, abdominal pain, and bubbles or seals.
However, they are often not accompanied by pains or other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer 100% protection.
In fact, partially transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact infection and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend a regular survey, especially when sexual partners are frequently changed.
Early diagnosis can cure most of the STDs and avoid remote effects.
Chiefship, donations, and not least choir fees all over Germany allow for something to be collected.
"All we've sent to Estrangeni is about 200,000 euros," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, money from Germany is managed by Sodwa Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also cares that orphans are well arranged, such as one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call it in Zulu old women, is the base of the village.
Some have taken up to 14 orphaned children to their homes, give them a roof over their head, and make sure that their uniforms appear on time every day.
Those who have no relatives go to Hanysil's shelter, a lonely woman who is paid by the association, as well as two cooks who prepare for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two hen-houses and, together with the U.S. health organization, organized an HIV testing campaign for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but a disease that is so obvious throughout the country is preferred to be deeply silent.
King with 14 Wives
"Aids is absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's sexual."
It's rather unusual for a country where the King officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Misswati III, is known for his love for excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a State-sanctioned way of life is also responsible for the rapid spread of the HlV in past years.
But it also lies on wandering workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they're hardly used.
The other culture is flesh to flesh."
To support a little cultural exchange, the Ibmogoni chorus travels every two or three years around South Africa and sings songs full of sadness, combat, confidence and black consciousness, which many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since the time of Apartheid.
A bus full of whites, singing songs in a black language -- such a confession not only brings a good mood and joy, but even happened, caused tears in the eyes of hard border guards.
The trip also leads to Estogeni, where singers visit underwear children.
Although a small village is hard to find on a map, it is more known in the Etsulveni Valley.
"Go to Eszitgeni, there's light," say the people here.
And after a 8733 km flight back to Heidelberg, when drowning singers return to the rehearsal at Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is on fire here too.
Messinger: NASA opens ice on Mercury
The Messinger has found evidence that there's ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be 20 meters thick.
The US Space Authority has proved that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is located nearest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in a special journal Science.
The Messinger has found evidence that an ice-covered region of the planet is constantly in the shadows.
It must be at least 30 inches thick, perhaps up to 20 meters thick.
Supposedly, the water comes from a comet, or perhaps an asteroid, that comes into contact with Mercurius.
No one links the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the scientist of the probe Sean Solomon.
Mercury's temperature can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life got to other parts of the solar system.
Invisiblely for the inhabitants of the Earth, probes, telescopes, and small robots, such as Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth, with little windows in endless shapes.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who turns around the sun after Neptune, Ceres, by a new definition of the 2006 international astronomical union, is not a planet.
This infrared image of the Spitter telescope represents a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in blue dots are harder to identify in a star circle the pink "born" stars.
This planetary region, scientifically called the W5, was discovered by the Spitter telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This tempestuous temperature of a dying star photographed a NASA Spitter telescope.
A doughnut-like ring consists of material that the star ejected in the process of dying.
In the giant trifide nebula, 5 400 light years away from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA Spitter Telescope took this picture of a galactic delivery hall.
The planetary cluster of the Pleiade, also known as the Seven Nurses, can be seen with an unarmed eye at night.
Of course, with a telescope, color is better.
As the red eye winks to the observer, the snail's nebula on this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the constellation of the Aquarius.
The analogy to the Earth's continent brought this nebula by the nickname "North America."
A combination of normal and infrared photos provides a distinct color transfer.
Only infrared Spitter telescope sensors were able to photograph this new star in all its beauty.
Saturn and his rings: How they emerged is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
These are probably pieces of the moon of Saturn, which disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and clearest images of the Hubble Telescope: the Waterway galaxy
Depending on the color transfer, images of spiral galaxies are turned into real art.
A photograph published by the European South observatory shows the thousands of light-years remote trifide nebula in the star of the shooter.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word trifidus (tribal, tridular), because dark stripes of dust divide the hot heart of the stars into three parts.
In the constellation of the Serpent, astronomers photographed the foreground of a space collision: 400 million light years away from the Earth, the kernels of the two merging galaxies are running up against each other and are bound to run into each other.
This is the birth of a Hubble telescope star filmed in a spiral galaxy called M83.
A person who doesn't like technical abbreviations may call it the Southern Chain Wheel.
A photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
Nebula, which is 1 400 light years away, consists of particles of dust whose size is between 10 and 100 times smaller than that of normal home-grown dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes that is 430 million light years away from the Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The Great Spiral Galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this starn nebula lies the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The Star Cradle constantly creates new stars.
This star cloud, connected to the Rosetta Nebula, is also constantly creating new stars at a distance of 5,000 light years from the Earth.
There's no dust in this bright glowing galaxy with a small black hole, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it occurred shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly water.
Our View of the Universe: Critical Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersey, even before Galilei began to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more, and the space available to them has become deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror here had a diameter of five meters.
Arizona, U.S.A., has a Big Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter.
The Grand Telescopio Canarias has a giant internal device, with a mirror alone having a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Greater South African Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to reduce costs.
However, it reaches about 11 meters in diameter.
A lack of inexpensive design: the telescope is tightly fastened at a vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
His specialty: high light-enhancing ability.
It reaches, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
Through a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to alien signals in space.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Project "Seti Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
A view of the European astronomical service (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
There's a "Very Large Telescope" here, totally matching its name.
His four mirrors allow even the average infrared spectrum to be lit in the visual pipe.
A European "Very Large Telescope" is also planned to be installed at the Chilean ESO observatory.
His main mirror is to spread about 42 meters, and it will be composed of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photos should not be expected before 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian Mount Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors of 10 meters in diameter.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which, along with them, is also staring into the sky by means of Subaru and IRTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope, with a mirror 30 meters in diameter, should appear on Mauna Kea.
Here you can admire the pictures.
However, the most important species in space supply the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990 he has provided pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, especially those on which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the start of the mission.
The photograph shows the latest designs of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be shipped into space until 2018 on board the "Arian 5" rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope is six and a half meters in diameter.
One of the problems of the telescope is that it has to search the world of the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists suggest that there is ice on the South Pole of Mercurius.
However, there is no reliable evidence of this because the Messinger is rotating closer to the North Pole of the planet.
Mirror measurements for decades have indicated that there is ice on Mercuria.
Thanks to the 2004 launch of the Messinger probe, the first one that revolves around Mercurius, scientists are now sure of that.
Drink butter every day--and live till the age of 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are of high Bible age.
There's even a longevity museum here.
Looking for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are of high Bible age.
There's even a longevity museum here.
Looking for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
Traveling through the Talich Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
A crowded minibus rolls along a swollen road past thickly planted hills, turbulent streams and simple farmhouses.
Everything is so green and bright, you can think of it as being in the Schwartzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; the Iranian border is only a few miles from here.
This is one of the tribes of the Caucasus, of which there is little knowledge, except that they speak perfectly Farsi and Azeri and have longevity.
The end point is Lerik.
The small town is staring at the too heavy architecture of Soviet times, which is not at all in harmony with the beautiful mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here; the road from the capital of Baku, Azerbaijan, is too exhausting.
It takes eight hours for 323 miles because the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth to which the country owes the oil of the Cape Sea, here, to the province, has not yet arrived.
However, Pilate Fatulayev (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in.
"In May Baku became famous for the Euro-Views Song Festival -- and next year we'll have a festival of the world's oldest people," says Fatulaeva.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, probably the only one in the world.
There's a biography of about eight dozen of these places that are over 100 years old, and Fatulaeva points to a black and white picture.
This is my grandpa, he's 120 years old here.
He had another child at the age of 136
But the disputed star of the museum is the Chirali Muslumov Chaban, who is allegedly 168 years old.
No birth certificate, however.
And given that the oldest person whose age is recognized as having reached the age of 122, the age of Muslumov seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this district in 1805, died in 1973," explained Fatulayev.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he had allegedly had a daughter.
So did the Chaban Muslums add a couple of decades to their age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher of age from the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of longevity in Central Asia.
"A surprisingly large number of older people can also be found in some parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "there are also extremely many very old people living in Sardinia."
However, because of the lack of documents, it was not possible to scientifically confirm age, as there were no civil registers.
Every day a glass of warm oil
However, there is a fact that people in the Lerik district often reach Bible age.
It is home to 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why are there so many long livers here in the south?
The Azerbaijan guide Farid Mugimzade explains this with special dice genes.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, on the contrary, believes it's about food.
Tickets like meat, bread, and the most dairy foods, many of them drink a glass of hot oil every day, but hardly such a high calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary perspective.
In Changemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, there's Rubaba Mirzoeva.
At age 97 she was still relatively young for these latitudes.
Myrzaev, who claims to have 173 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of butter, which she can't tired of driving up and down.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva's sons and daughter, who have long had grandchildren.
There's two kids in the neighborhood, too.
In the kitchen, guests get tea served in typical bubble cups of armood.
Mirzavo has perfectly uniform and strong white teeth, under her headscarf she hides the long dark-rowed joints that her son proudly opens before us.
I always wash my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"And I never used shampoo," said Mirzaev.
Monthly pension is sufficient for living
She always ate only what grew up in her own courtyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought a grocery store in my entire life.
She then talks about her husband, who was in the army.
The hardest part was after the Second World War.
But it got better when Geidar Aliyev's "loving father" got in control.
Propaganda doesn't often sound like an old woman's speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who was ruled by the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan had hardly any borders.
He was in power until 2003, and his son Ilham took over.
However, there is no poverty among older people in Azerbaijan.
230 manats (about the same amount as the euro) Mirzaev receives monthly pension, for local conditions it's a good living on.
And perhaps the long-growing son of Mirzaeva is also right, "Old people in our culture enjoy deep respect."
They live in a large family, loved, cared for and happy.
No reason to remain alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is not contained in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo are evidence of a deep division of the country.
The future constitution, based on the sharia, had met with a fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president didn't sting for the pafos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success lies upon my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on State television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all to Christian Cops, the liberators, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
For all of them, still hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are frightened.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the mighty "Moslem Brothers."
Mohammed Mursi, almost apologizing, said that he temporarily reduced the competence of the constitutional court and expanded his competence to “save the revolution”.
But what really wants to save a 61-year-old engineer with a Ph.D. at the University of South California is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judicial power be stripped of power?
In fact, 234 articles were dragged into a night-long 15-hour leap with obstacles to a 100-member Islamist constitutionist assembly, and this is partly disturbing.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the proceedings are based on the “principles of Islamic law”.
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and continues to be a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use the vague language and the resulting legal luuffle to better interpret the sharia.
At least one new article suggests this: in all matters concerning sharia, the university of Al-Ashar, the country's most important Islamic institution, enjoys great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be involved in the council.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy is watching over the law, which would de facto result in a limitation of the judicial power.
In the draft constitution, much is interpreted
Another problem is that civilians must remain subject to military trial.
These courts under Mubarak's power were used to suppress opponents.
After the dictator's overthrow, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military detention.
Also, as the draft states, the State must protect the "genuine nature of the Egyptian family" and "maintain its morals and values."
This is so vague in legal terms that government agencies will be able to control even the content of the film and literature.
It means nothing but censorship.
No article explicitly provides for equality between men and women.
However, the other forbids insulting and insulting the prophet Muhammad and his envoys.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains uncertain.
It was also doubtful what was prohibited from “intimidating people”.
Will cartoons be enough for the president or jokes about law school?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this draft, which Mursi suggests for signature and which he said will be submitted to the Egyptians for referendum “very soon”.
"The revolution has returned."
For weeks now, opposition against Islamist superiority has been forming.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity on Friday evening at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy this document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who held the third position in the Presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the international atomic power agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, declared that the draft constitution was a place in the dump of history.
Through a short Twitter news service, he accused Morsi's followers of wanting to lead a "putch against democracy."
"If he announces a referendum, we'll go to his palace and throw it away," said the opposition, Yasser Said.
"We're not tired yet; the blood of our brothers is not yet avenged," quoted Egyptian media in the opposition policy of Khaled Ali.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our constitution."
The well-organized "Moslem Brothers" in turn called for a contrary demonstration, but not at Tahrir Square, but after a massive prayer on the other side of the Nile before the University of Cairo.
It was attended by a large number of women under blankets and Salafites who shouted, "People demand the application of God's law."
They demanded that Morsi "clean the country!" and said, "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area on which everything began has triggered the state of almost civil war.
The followers of Morsi evidently did not want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brothers stated that both the opponents and the advocates of the draft constitution were loud and clear.
It is now time to let the people decide in the box in which direction the country should go.
Most for the Islamist project, this is considered a settled matter.
"The notion of human rights is never mentioned."
Hafiz Abu Sayeda is furious about this fortified constitutional process, which was actually to last until February with the participation of all public forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (ELO) defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison under Mubarak or were tried.
Not because he shared their world view, but because human rights were inseparable to him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the word "human rights" is never found in the new constitution, and he regrets talking to "Welt am Sonntag."
The increased influence of Mursi on all three branches of government in the State disappoints the lawyer.
These measures are clear blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"In addition to a stronger civil state, the President de facto revoked it," said Saed.
After all, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Sayeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which is looking at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mix of curiosity and tension.
That could pay the price.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns, "You are creating a monster you can't control."
Norwegian Racfisk: The world's most bad-smelling fish?
Norway's five million people have one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but worldwide.
Perhaps the secret of this country's success has something to do with the local addiction to one extremely stinking fish dish?
Take some overflying pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You're going to have a resounding smell of raqfic, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacy.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's beautiful, but there's an indestructible smell in the air.
Racfisk is a trout stained with salt and wandering in the water till a year, depending on what kind of squirrel you're going to get.
As the twilight gathers and it freezes, a crowd of Norwegians are going to a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this very, let's say, exciting dish.
"She eats raw and drinks a drink of acavia, a local dark wodka," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter who runs the festival as a part of his profession and as a "Rackfish General."
People around us eat small cubes-cut fish and drink it with lots of liquor.
"Someone likes aquavit rather than a raqfic," says Howard.
This drink can break the smell.
I'm trying a couple of pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not so bad -- it's not much different from the sushi you've been driving on the bus for a long time.
Racfisk is a Norwegian product from a completely different age, a period of poverty, when, even before the fridges appeared, fish were soaked in hermetically closed barrels of salt water in the fall.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish had grown well and thoroughly tired, it was extracted and used to suppress the perception of alcohol.
Even in the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to migrate mostly to the United States.
The population is now growing rapidly, with more than 13% of immigrants attracted by jobs, high wages and an advanced social security system.
The people of Sweden (a longtime rival and not so long ago and a much more affluent neighbour) come to work here massively.
Racfisk is perceived as an important symbol, a sinister, though somewhat sinister, element of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, it's expensive. A little beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 (14 U.S. dollars).
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and most of the country's inhabitants seem to be satisfied with that.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Bravik, a right-wing racist and extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called "the July 22th incident."
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their citizens has been able to commit such violence and murder.
Norway's current well-being is based on the growth (since the beginning of the 1970s) of one of the largest oil and gas sectors in the world.
"But oil isn't the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, dissociating trays with well-articulated raffinine, a woman with long, light hair and surprisingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordeal well-being.
We are such a people, as you call it, a reasoner.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English perfectly.
We don't like to show, we're not bragging.
Norway is very careful with its oil, and most of the oil and gas revenue is invested in a special fund set up for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, in which everyone had lost money they had not, Norway had carefully calculated all costs.
"As long as you can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, that's enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there's a raqfic," she adds with a careless laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food. I've had enough of that.
Here's the hamburger with the moose meat -- it's definitely exotic, it's delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening, we'll have more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
My hotel hosts a special raqfic dinner, during which visitors vote to determine the best or perhaps the most scenty fish.
There's a live telefeed showing a roller in a rabbit tie surrounded by plates.
It's like the Euro-View Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Jurgen, what's your score for the best fish there in your mountains?"
"Yes, Harward, here's our score."
Everybody laughs and applauds.
Someone falls from a chair, perhaps bypassing the aqualite.
Or maybe just suffocating with the smell of that fish.
President Henrique Peña Nieto of Mexico has a difficult start to make.
While the newly elected President of Mexico, Henrique Peña Nieto, is about to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
The traffic in Mexico City is now in particularly poor condition.
This city has been overstretched in the best time possible, and steel fences have been erected since Monday, cutting several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from getting to the Parliament.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Henrique Peña Nieto, will put on a Presidential link and take over the country.
He's got a difficult task ahead of him.
Mexico had achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderon, which was now assuming power, but the country had become caught up in a war against drugs that had already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has declared to the people of Mexico its readiness to combat violence," Mr. Peña Nieto earlier this week told US President Barack Obama in the White House Oval Office.
I am going to suggest a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Before such statements, Mr. Peña Nieto's political career as governor of his native state of Mexico City had progressed alongside the President of the United States.
In his home country, in a densely populous and vast state surrounding the capital, opinions about the new leader were divided.
Direct person
In the Idyllian town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered warmly.
The inhabitants commend him for reviving the tourist industry, developing the resort industry and building infrastructure.
One of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which is quite different from those of the scavengers and pits that were previously in the area, can be reached.
Tablets with his name hang on the modern building of the sports centre and on an exciting interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We have hopes for real and serious change with him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a State Congressman from the Peña Nieto Institutive Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that our country so desperately needs, especially in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous power, the PRI party was replaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the Los Pinos Presidential Palace, the party puts high hopes on Henrik Peña Nieto.
He also denied the charges of lack of self-sufficiency which the opposition had put forward to the new President.
It is very direct and very committed to the realization of its vision for the future of the country.
He's an excellent statesman, and above all, a man who can listen.
But in the other part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The Nesaualcoyotl city, also known as Ciudad Nessa, is the most striking contrast to the paved streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under motorways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the city are also the severity of this mega-city.
Earlier this year, military forces had been engaged to curb drug gangs in those areas; and violence against women was particularly acute.
Several dozen bodies of murdered women have been found in the desert near a large dump in the past two years alone.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during Mr. Peña Nieto's governorship, a figure which is much greater than that in the notoriously violent town of Ciudad Juárez, whose name has become negative when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to Mr. Peña Nieto's opponents, he could at best be said to have been unable to cope with the problem of killing women during his term as governor.
At worst, his administration is accused of ignoring the problem completely.
A woman living in a concrete house, similar to most of the houses in this dilapidated area, Irina Buendia has difficulty holding back her tears by showing me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of Mariana, in 2010 she committed suicide.
However, her family believed that her companion had killed her.
"When I got to her house, it seemed like her body had been washed before," Mrs. Buendia remembered.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and her body was already frozen.
Mariana's mother tells this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifixion on which only one word is written: justice.
This is what they said the family was denied.
"The state's officials treated me like an old gossiper, dissatisfied with a calmer.
They want people to just believe everything they say and keep quiet.
But it's wrong, it can't, especially when there's so many abuses and shortcomings around you," she says.
After wearing a Presidential bandage on Saturday, President Peña Nieto will take on a difficult responsibility with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crimes, and the new President has promised to make this a priority during his reign.
"I hope he'll be exactly the same president as the governor," says Olvera, a Congressman from Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
But that is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Ness are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning didn't complain of any ill-treatment, claims the prosecution.
The prosecution is trying to deny Bradley Manning's claims of poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, emphasis was placed on Manning's stay in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence demands that the case be dismissed on the ground that Manning's conditions of detention were cruel.
The U.S. military is accused of stealing several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in United States history, had not availed himself of many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment which he said he had had to endure while in military prison.
During the cross-examined pre-trial hearing in Fort Mid, Maryland, the military prosecutor, Major Ashden Feyn, stated that the records of the weekly visits to Manning by the prison authorities during the nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-trial of the defence motion to discontinue the Manning case, on the ground that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in themselves sufficient punishment, was carried out the day after Manning stated that he intended to commit suicide while in detention.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 was accused of stealing several thousand secret documents during his service in Iraq.
These materials were later published on the WikiLeaks web site.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During the hearing on Friday, the prosecutor, Feyn, along with Manning, examined the reports which had been completed following Manning's visits to the administration during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was held under strict prison conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When D.A. Feyn asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he considered the prison administration to be "excellent" and the general conditions of detention to be "very professionally organized".
The reports examined do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite the fact that Manning was directly asked about the conditions of his detention, Phein claims.
Manning replied that he had expressed his verbal concern about these issues and that the officials who visited him had discussed these issues with him and had stated that they would take care of them but had not recorded them in writing.
"They wrote "no problems" (after my complaints were discussed), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise the subject in the conversation," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Deniz Lindh, also asked Manning why he had not complained of the abuse of him in January 2011 during a meeting of a commission considering the suicide intentions he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to be removed from the “injury warning” regime and to ease the conditions of detention.
The military authorities explained that the restricted regime of detention, at a level lower than that of surveillance to prevent suicide, had been introduced to protect the prisoner and to protect the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm okay with them to undo the accident prevention regime... so that my standard of living would improve, in my view," explained Manning.
On Thursday, Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to a prison at a navy base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thought about suicide in Kuwait and that he had once lost consciousness due to the heat.
He explained that it is psychologically difficult when you are prevented from knowing how your fate is handled and what happens in the outside world.
"My world leaned down to Camp Arifian's base, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I was going to die in this cell."
While in Quantico, he said that Manning spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day -- alone.
Manning reports that he was allowed to keep only mattresses, blankets, slaps, some clothes and glasses.
He says he was trying to move because sleeping or even lying down during the daytime prohibited the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he was constantly hit by a light coming through the outside of the cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he was turning around in bed at night, he said he was waken and forced to turn around on his back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection to the abuse of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
Moreover, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he had made during his statement on Thursday that, after being forced to sleep naked one night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners during the morning check.
Manning said he couldn't cover himself with a blanket during the check.
In reply to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said that he understood from the guard's order that he should throw a blanket to cover for, but admitted that no one had directly ordered him to dump him.
On Thursday, Manning announced that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reported that he told the officer that he could use a slippery rubber or a slab to hurt himself, but he didn't do it.
That night, according to Manning's statement, his underwear, his slaps and glasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had to endure during his detention and would significantly reduce the sentence if Manning were found guilty by a military court which was due to start his trial early next year.
The defence stated that it intended to invite Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes and to challenge other charges as excessive.
The reopening of the hearing is scheduled this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules regulating the detention of arrested persons under the strictest conditions.
The charges brought against Manning included aiding the enemy, illegal promotion of data on the Internet, transmission of information concerning national defence and theft of State property or documents.
If convicted of all counts, he may be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican descent.
According to the author, many Mexicans had been forced to leave Mexico because of a lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans are inclined to blame those who have left because they remind the inhabitants of difficult times.
Reuben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American descent are breaking up between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked through the incoming corridor, approached the border control zone and frozen on the ground.
The labels showed two queues: one for Mexicanos, one for Extremjeros.
I stood in front of them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and they've always called me Mexican.
It's just a conditional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York think they're Italian.
Later, I focused on the complex design of "American Mexican."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's home, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than my tongue, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and was in line for Extremjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected President of Mexico, Henrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The issues of migration, drugs and trade that were common to the Presidents of those countries were on the agenda.
President Peña Nieto spoke eagerly of the recovery of the Mexican economy, which would make it possible for Mexicans to stay in Mexico now, rather than to move to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the US and Canada and to create some sort of North American trade bloc like the European Union.
Moreover, President Peña Nieto had promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific suggestions had been made.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is a grave, old-fashioned matter.
Most Americans never thought that the United States had invaded Mexico in 1848 and that its leaders had been forced to abandon half their territory at gunpoint.
But Mexicans have been thinking for centuries, not for minutes, and they have seen reminders of those events in everything.
So it's only when a U.S. government actor speaks a word of criticism against Mexico, the press, and the elite of Mexican society immediately complains that Americans violate the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the descendants of Montezuma are filled with war.
The most difficult, however, are Mexico's relations with over 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about grievances?
That's enough.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities in this country, and those who don't.
In L.A., L.C., L.C., Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican descent have only one reason: at some point in their family history, someone -- father or grandfather -- was unable to realize themselves in Mexico and had to go north.
Most commonly, they were Mexicans of a certain type -- dark, uneducated, poor peasant families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
That's not what they see in Mexico.
Today, our lives are the embodiment of an American dream, and we've been in good schools and we've got good jobs, but we can't forget that even that dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and uncertain, but we know which country to consider to be its own.
United States of America.
Besides, we know that most of the Mexican elite and rulers don't like us.
We say the same to them.
They see us as a reminder of humiliation, and they treat us as second-class people, as untrue Mexicans.
We speak not enough Spanish, and our ties to Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind the silk curtain now, finding a healthy life in the United States, but losing our spiritual connections.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States when she was a child, and this reminds me that there is a certain friction between real Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin, and Mexicans understand their national identity better, and Mexicans are hurt.
She's a U.S. citizen, and she thinks she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances, of Mexican descent, do not feel belonging to any of them.
We're listening to a Mexican band called Los Tigers del Norte, but we love Bruce Springsteen too.
By getting the best of the two worlds, you're bound to lose your roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, they call us Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relationship was already not complicated enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore their relationship with the Diaspora.
They want Americans of Mexican descent to work as Mexican ambassadors and represent their interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how wonderful it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It's not going to work.
Too much resentment in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country to be so beautiful.
Sorry, but take care of it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans are still unable to forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still offended by the way their relatives have been treated most recently in Mexico.
Yeah.
I think we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
A cease-fire agreement between Israel and the Hamas faction can become a fragile foundation for further peace
Is lasting peace possible between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodguilt leads to the conclusion that such hopes are vain.
It was a familiar, pointless debate about who had begun; numerous buildings had been turned into ruins; over 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis had been killed; and rockets fired from the Gaza Strip had dropped in the vicinity of the capital of Israel, Tel-Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem for the first time during the conflict.
However, despite the hopeless link between Israelis and the Palestinian people in their perennial conflict, the Middle East has changed.
This may be treated differently, but the events of the Arab Spring have swirled in a rioting storm with many established realityes, and the Palestinian and Israelis have not been able to stay away from the whirlwind that has shaken the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
There are, however, reasons for hope of breaking this deadly dead end.
A War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation did not give rise to a cause for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire, which was signed on 21 November, is being implemented, the fighting this week has only reinforced the positions of the protagonists on both sides.
The leaders of the Israeli Islamist movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will claim to have forced Israel to retreat despite its loss.
Despite the fact that some leaders of the faction have been destroyed and 1.7 million people have been blocked in one of the most populous and troubled parts of the world, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
In fact, it is growing popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian Territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well conclude that time works for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements grows in the Arab world, new powerful and rich friends have emerged.
The renaissance of the Turkish regional leader, who once was Israel's closest ally among the Islamic countries, had given support to the United Kingdom, followed by the example of Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic States in the Persian Gulf.
The glorified supporter of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland announced the creation of an Israeli-based Islamist half-month, from Lebanon to the north, which was ruled by the military Hezbollah, to Syria, where the ever-growing Islamist rebels were about to overthrow the power of Bashar Assad, and further to Jordan, where the King's authorities threatened the allies of the United Kingdom.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood was enhanced under President Muhammad Morsi.
Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled Egypt for 30 years and had been overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay much attention to the support of Hamas.
The Muslims, on the contrary, are a much-like organization, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic positions, Hamas can become a significant player whose voice will not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, the hardline in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli anti-ballistic missile system, the "Iron dome" system, had justified the cost of its creation and had successfully destroyed many of the rockets launched by Hamas.
Israelis can sleep quietly, at least for a while.
In the area of diplomacy, the US has remained firm; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for launching the last round of violence.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, particularly under the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that some 30 Israelis had died since 2004 from rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel had managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly at the expense of the wall which entered the West Bank of the Jordan, a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian State, and protected Jewish settlements, which continued to expand despite the illegality of such actions under international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, in preparation for the elections to be held on 22 January, has merged with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Liberiaman, is very convenient.
What's the point of persuading the Palestinian people and giving them their own State?
If they hand over all the power in the West Bank, would they not start launching rockets from there towards Israel, as their companions in the Gaza Strip did?
It's best to keep them outside the wall and severely suppress any attempt to lift their heads.
It is possible that hard-line advocates will win; however, their calculations may be denied in the Arabic spring.
While Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and elsewhere, do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defensive part of Israel's budget is larger than all its Arab neighbours combined.
Launching a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments to strengthen their own economy.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Mursi, who worked with Barack Obama to stop the fire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel must, to no lesser extent, bear in mind the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic changes have taken place in the Arab countries, depriving the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination is a time bomb that will explode sooner or later in the occupied Israeli territories, like the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
The repression already undermines the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic aspect -- the growth of the Arab population -- only makes those problems worse.
The bloodthirsty operations carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement have to be paid for by the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need external momentum
There remains the only solution to which sane representatives on both sides are constantly calling for, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two States and Israel's transfer of lands in exchange for security.
The hope remains, not too strong in the short term, that a cease-fire will enable other countries to influence the parties to the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, long overdue in its decision to stop arms flows to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, has a more favourable position than ever in order to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State since 1967, taking into account the exchange of lands and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries must also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
That would do more to create a Palestinian State than the upcoming vote in the United Nations, which could result in a recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama has a role to play in bringing Israel to the table.
During his first term, he had not submitted his own peace plan.
Upon his return to the White House, he remained reluctant to join the problem.
This is a devastating short-sighted position.
The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinian people.
The Unified Packing for Cigarette Act has entered into force in Australia.
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and images of disease-stricken body parts contrast on dull green boxes, which are the same for all cigarette stamps.
The first Australian law on uniform packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products has come into force in the world, replacing logos and colouring of different stamps with a box of dilapidated-liquid-coloured images of sick body parts and images of children whose health is affected by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to the various images and inscriptions that warn of the dangers of smoking, the only difference between packages introduced on this Saturday is the name of the stamps, which are printed in the same small font.
These are the most difficult conditions in the world for packaging tobacco.
The Australian Federal Government states that the aim of this measure is to prevent young people from smoking, depriving them of this dangerous fashion habit.
This decision was based on studies showing that people who had not started smoking before 26 years of age had never become smokers in 99 cases out of 100.
"It is evident that even when they are young, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey through packaging," explains the Minister of Health, Tanya Plybersek, referring to studies that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with children's idea of a princess.
Australia was one of the countries with the lowest smoking rate in the world, so that those changes would not affect the returns of transnational corporations much, but other countries were already considering such measures.
The tobacco industry has strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
The tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and accessible cigarettes are sold.
"This law will have serious consequences that are different from those which have been suggested by its initiators," said Scott McIntyre, a British American Tobacco agent in Australia.
Manufacturers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, new laws contribute to business growth.
Sandra Ha of a small family company, Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for cigarettes and silicon cabinets concealing unpleasant images on the package has grown rapidly (practicably from zero) since two months ago companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their case in Australia's High Court, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about 6,000 pieces to the bulk industry and is waiting for a new batch.
It's a good business for us.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the target population.
Following the passage of a series of laws in Australia that have made illegal television advertisements of cigarettes and their support for sporting events, as well as bans on the placing of cigarettes on the spot, tobacco advertisements have been moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has prohibited local companies and websites from posting advertisements online, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you sell tobacco and you have only this little loophole left, the idea of moving your product online would seem very tempting to you," explains Beki Freeman, a student of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of salesmark reviews written on behalf of alleged common users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is it really the work of a private citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he's spared his energy and time and made a video, or is it the advertising company that's behind it?
British American Tobacco, Australia, claims that the industry is now more engaged in adapting to new rules than advertising.
The tobacco industry had even undertaken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: those States were filing claims under the World Trade Organization, arguing that trade had been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that trade relations between all those countries and Australia were very small.
A decision by the World Trade Organization is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plybersek, the Government had discussed with other countries the possibility of introducing similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce mandatory smoking warning photos.
This rule has now been adopted in over 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering the possibility of tightening their laws.
Many smokers in Australia do not obey innovation.
These pictures don't bother me.
I just don't mind.
"Just grab a cigarette and hide a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumour on a pack.
To be honest, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yu, manager of the tobacco store, King of the Pack in central Sydney, claims that the same packaging has made it difficult to place the goods on the shelves.
"Before I had an hour to unload the new batch, and now it's four o'clock," he complains.
"The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would have said, what to do, okay, it's over, shut the store," he said, throwing his hands up.
Missing in a world of electronic networks and constant connections isn't so bad.
On this thanksgiving day I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical problems and was replaced with another plane that we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I won't deceive you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and neither books nor magazines nor iPhone nor even duty-free shops will help.
Recently, however, more and more researchers and professionals in child development have been expressing themselves in favour of boredom.
They say that in certain situations it is not so bad for us and for our children to miss.
This forces the brain to distract itself from interesting related themes, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in today's world all of us are constantly in front of some screen, the advantages of boredom pass us by.
Maybe we should pursue boredom.
Yeah.
And at the same time, no.
We'll get back to that.
I used to believe, like many, that boredom is an invention of relatively recent times, when people have had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University of Canada, author of the book Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient history," he says.
The walls of Pompeii have found Latin boredom inscriptions dated the first century.
However, the question of how we understand boredom remains open.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying research on this subject and asking a question to a target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came up with the following definition: boredom is when people “have but cannot do what pleases them”.
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored man doesn't do anything he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything with apathy.
The main thing in the boredom is, he says, "disobedient attention and the resulting loss of mood and the feeling that time is taking slow."
The description of boredom may seem very depressive.
However, Professor Eastwood claims that despite the possible connection between these conditions, bored people see the causes of the problems in the world and the circumstances, while depressed people see the problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel like we're bored when it's really hard to focus on something.
In his study "Unoccupied Mind: Defining Boring From a Attention Perspective," published in September by the Journal of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to a previous experiment which had listened to a recording of a voice reading the magazine.
Some participants also heard loud sounds of a non-essential television program in the next room, others heard the same sounds on low volume, so they could hardly be addressed, and a third group listened only to recording a voice without a foreign sound track.
Those who heard a low volume TV said they were bored, more often -- they had difficulty getting focused, but they didn't know the reason and attributed it to the boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at Gwelph University, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, by looking into the flow of goods on the conveyor in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."
It's believed that when people start to swing on a chair or draw carakul on a piece of paper, they do it for boredom, but now we know that, in fact, such actions just help not to relax physically.
"The study found that children who are not prevented from being bullied and rotating learn better and learn more information than children who are being asked to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
At some point we all get bored: in the delay of the flight (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting movie.
However, different people show different degrees of boredom.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “discipline scale” to measure such individual characteristics.
To determine an estimate on such a scale, questions and suggestions are used, such as "Much of what I have to do is uniformly and monotonously" or "I'm too interested, so there's not enough time for anything."
With such a survey, researchers have found that boys miss girls more frequently,” says Stephen Oddovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when there are a variety of external irritants.
In general, however, teenagers are often bored.
In 1991 Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, carried out an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven or eight times a day with a pager.
He received the following results: 32% of teenagers reported bored at school and during their homework, and 23% reported bored outside of school.
However, only 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no information on what such data would be about boredom now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "adolescence has a peak in boredom," mainly because children and teenagers are not allowed to fully decide what to do with it.
Let's go back to my original question: boredom is useful?
Sometimes not, because, in extreme cases, research suggests that it can lead people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky games or substance abuse in an effort to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have been thinking about the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor Oddowitsch, who has spent more than two decades studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us to do something else; this is boredom," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
However, this very brain does not always know what to do best.
If you get bored and you put that energy into a game on a gitarre or cooking experiment, you'll do yourself a better job.
But if you start watching TV, you'll only get better for a while, and it'll soon pass.
So if your child misses and you give him an iPad, he won't miss it, but he won't learn to fight boredom alone or otherwise manage his time and employment,' said Professor Fenske.
"And such self-regulatory skills are used in a variety of situations," he claims.
Your child learns not only to take care of himself, he learns to control himself at all.
I don't think boredom needs to be exalted.
But it shouldn't be considered a bad thing either.
Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"We see it in such a way that we need to experience boredom more frequently, while boredom is an extremely unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to somehow get off their constant worries and just relax.
"In today's world, we're used to constantly overstimulating our senses," he says, "and when silence comes, we lose our senses and we don't know what to do."
So far, it is not clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana will apply in Colorado
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football player and a college student in South-East Colorado, has been accused of committing a criminal offence, which will soon be perfectly legal throughout the state: keeping a small port of marijuana and the pipe in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosko said that once in September he and his friends were in Lamar and were driving in a car along the prairie along the border with Kansas when they were stopped by police officers.
After a policeman found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orosco was summoned to court for possession of drugs and possession of drugs, a minor offence for which a fine of $100 was due, and a date had been set for the trial.
"We're treated like criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has been going on for weeks since Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small amounts for entertainment, hundreds of small cases depend not so much on the law as on the place of the trial.
Charges for minor marijuana offences have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, D.C., which has taken a similar action.
The police stations have already stopped pressing charges against people aged 21 and over for keeping small dosages, which will become legal once the law comes into effect within a couple of weeks.
However, in the more conservative districts of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to deal with existing cases of marijuana and are still responsible for the possession of this drug.
At the same time, in some cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West, there is a vote to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops from appearing in their places.
"All this is growing so fast that I don't even know what to expect next," says Daniel J. Outs, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
The government officials in Washington state are also puzzled to scratch their heads.
They have to establish rules for licensing the production, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, all of which need to be done by 1 December 2013.
They say Colorado, well or badly, is ahead of most other states in managing the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado, a more structured market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, a representative of the Board of Directors of Drinking and Marketing in Washington, D.C.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits, than make some suggestions and hope that it will work.
"We don't have a real precedent to focus on," he says.
The Washington State Bill, named I-502, will come into force on 6 December and will put the State in a state of uncertainty for a year when there is no State licensing system and the ownership of marijuana has already been legalized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to strike a balance between the state's "adequate access" to authorized marijuana and the ban on selling it 1,000 feet away from schools, parks, playgrounds and nursery gardens.
"It will be particularly difficult to place licensing plants in urban areas, particularly in and around the city," explains Ben Livingstone, a representative of the recently established research group `Centre for Legalization of Marijuana.'
On 21 November, the police chief of Oates from Aurora sent an e-mail message to his officers that the city's prosecutor's office would no longer prosecute persons who had reached the age of 21 for possessing a small amount of marijuana, and that the police would cease to expose people to these abuses “from now on”.
The Chief of Police, Oates, said that the police would monitor the implementation of health-care regulations in the city and prosecute illegal drug users.
The Weld District prosecutor in North Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After a vote on the bill, he stated that the prosecutor ' s office would continue to prosecute the possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage users to receive treatment.
At present, there are 119 persons charged with possession of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them are also accused of other abuses.
"The duty of our institution to prosecute for acts which are considered criminal at the time of their commission," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places such as the village district of Mesa, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer prosecutes adults for possessing a small amount of drugs.
District attorney Pete Houtzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop the charges in pending marijuana cases.
"I believe that to enforce the law until it changes -- our direct responsibility," he says.
Although 55 percent of the people in Colorado who voted supported this decision, including the use of marijuana for entertainment in the State and the legal system will not be easy.
And the conflicting reaction of the people in various parts of the state has revealed ambiguities in the attitude of the local authorities to the state's marijuana experiment.
"There is a cultural barrier to this matter for district prosecutors," explained Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing convicted persons for possession of marijuana and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've been chasing people for this for so long that they can't really accept that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to treat a small amount of marijuana as well as alcohol, are meant to be a country-wide pilot field to test the very idea of legalizing drugs.
The advocates of legalization and state officials are planning to expand the area of legalized trade, but at the same time they are anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal authorities, who are still planning to treat the sale and growing of marijuana as a federal crime.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will give up on this matter.
Despite several high-profile arrests of drug users and patients using marijuana on medical grounds, the Federal Government has mostly approved the sale of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
The DEA agents are unlikely to break into their homes to seize a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes to state-regulated marijuana stores, which are authorized by the new law, as considered by Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug adviser in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the federal authorities to take action.
Even before the Presidential elections, some local governments had approved a freeze on the opening of new marijuana shops that could not have opened before a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in such a position that we give someone a license, and then it'll cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our city voted against this.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Peterella Wyette: I was saved from Oxford for being a conservator.
The harassment of university students for their views did not start today.
As long as I remember, I always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and older brother went to Oxford and described it as the world's best educational institution, a modern analogue to an ancient symposium that lays the two foundations of civilization: freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, at the University of Oxford University School of History, in the late '80s, I packed up my suitcases and left, which turned out to be the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper argued that I had dropped out of college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer, E. Norman Wilson, joked that I had left because I had to drink from squirrel cups.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically molested and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or because I was in a private school.
I was poisoned for only one reason, and in this glorified cradle of enlightenment it seemed a real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Wyette, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of conservatories.
You ask me, why would you think of that now?
According to recent data, a new generation of students with rights-based attitudes is subject to the same harassment.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred of conservatory students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that afforded to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the University Club of the Christie Corps in Cambridge claim that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and made to feel unwelcome guests" because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the college's Equal Rights Committee in order to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was compounded by the recent BBC 2 documentary on student politics, The Wonderland: Young, Smart, and Right, in which the conservators were presented as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, who drives the Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver stick.
In other universities, conservatory students complain that they're made of assails due to higher school fees.
Luke Black, 20, Vice President of the Nottingham University Conservatives Association, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that "in the university environment there is an increasing bias towards the left.
People who don't even know us think we're pre-conceived and violent children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, a student of the history faculty of the Christie Corps School, in which a request for enhanced protection was submitted, calls such an atmosphere "uncomfortable," while Stephanie Cheryll, 19 years old, the new president of the Oxford University Association of Conservatives, says that the attitude of the student club towards the rights centreists has significantly eroded.
"It is a threat to both the intellectual debate and the normal life of the members of the club," she says.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I was not just a minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a timid and shy 18 - year - old girl.
Oxford was in a hurry to hate the conservatory party.
One year earlier, the university had by vote denied former student Margaret Thatcher an honourable degree due to a reduction in the budget for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of a freshman's week, when students met each other and the teachers, I first felt what was waiting for me.
I didn't know that teachers had not only looked through their fingers at the harassment of conservatory students, but had also enjoyed participating in it.
The political issues -- the miners' strike, the privatization and the government's opposition to the application of sanctions against the South African Government of Apartheid -- broke through the wooden walls of audiences.
At my first workshop, I had to translate the 18th century French text into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Mrs. Whitet," said the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was hard for me, and I stuttered.
Harry Pitt was a very gallant man with a face like cake.
"The Tatchers don't really teach French, or do they just lack brains?" he asked.
Other students were fascinated.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take a few fresh French lessons in your spare time, unless you are very busy rotating in society," whispered Pitt.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night in college, I was sitting alone at dinner; then someone slapped me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from English, who introduced himself as a member of the University Conservatives Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
Anyone suspected of being sympathetic to conservers will be ridiculed.
It's hard for me, and in your case, they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be harder for you.
Most first-year conservatories pretend they're laborers."
Later, in the local pub, I lazyly tried to hypocrite.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything that Margaret Thatcher said.
Cleverness failed.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who himself studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students picked up his words.
I was corrupt, dirty.
"How do conservatories have sex?" asked one of them.
- They're beating each other up, aren't they?"
I felt as I must have felt homosexual before the criminal prosecution was lifted in the 1960s.
Will I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or will I only have to meet like-minded people under cover of night?
Would I be forced to become a laborer and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years began to look like hell full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who didn't hide his conservatory views was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a conservator, but also for being a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her speechwriters.
He hardly showed up in college.
He despised him for his provinciality, pettyness, and dedication to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he took a professor's position at the University of Biltent in Antarctica, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents' home in London, trying to find shelter among relatives and unbiased capital friends.
I told my father I hate Oxford and I explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the 1940s, any political opinions were adopted there.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said complainingly.
- There's no way to do that, except in a city of dim swabs...
Even my comunist friends have always behaved perfectly."
His damp eyes were blurred.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you leave the university."
I was exhausted by my constant trip to London and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, also a conservator, couldn't stand the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The following week during the seminar, when another history teacher seriously called me "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In the shower, burning with shame, I confessed that "I've been brainwashed by my parents," and I called them "old fools."
The break wasn't long.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was meant to kill my father.
At that time he wrote two columns each week for publications belonging to Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and five minutes later, my stalkers gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a cricket and a rag.
But at the age of 18, no one should be subject to such anger and harassment in a school.
The saddest is that it was Oxford, who not only released the 14 Tory prime ministers, but still conceals himself behind the unworthy reputation of a university that values equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers the elegantness of glory."
About the exhibition "Valentino: Sewing Master" which opened this week in London, ABC is talking to Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemitz and other famous Italian designers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of receiving the Valentino Harvani exhibition.
The designer recognized this during the opening of Valentino: the sewing master, a triumphant rectangular exhibition that combines more than 130 high-mode dresses created by his home over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of history, the only character of which is Harvani's "or signor," but it could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world to know.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, personal letters and photographs are rich, signed by the most prominent aristocrats, from the princess Salima Agha Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Santal, the princess of Greece, and Margaret, the princess of the United Kingdom.
Valentino shows these personal memories as spoils of his social uplift, from a humble tailor from Vogera in northern Italy to the idol of the international elite.
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong with that.
"They don't at least suck their cigarette cigarettes about your beautiful carpet, as some beautiful pop music stars do," said Baroness Fioon Tissen-Bornemitz.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a wonderful host and receives guests with grace and elegantness.
"We all enjoyed coming to his chalet in Gstayad," explained Tissen's ex-wife, a close friend of forgotten beautiful women like Marella Angelly or Yevgenia Niarjos.
Valentino always preferred the elegantness of glory.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza representing Valentino
The Argentine model of Valeria Mazza reminiscent of a charismatic modeler.
Once we went to dinner at his house, it was after a fashion show in Spain Square in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty guests were Sharon Stone and John JFK Jr.
Valentino's style appeared in everything--in every detail of his apartment, in her clothes, in her food, in his music.
"Everyone of Valentino's guests made him feel important and loved," recounts the "top model" which began working with the designer during the High fashion Week in Paris in 1995.
"He's never out of fashion, because his designs are real art," she finishes.
Ancestral parade
Harvani's life is not a history of obsession, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House's galleries was turned into a glamorous runway of 60 meters in length, which suggests a change of roles: a visitor takes a model seat and should defile on the runway, staring at "visits" of dreams that gleam with Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jacqueline JFK had chosen for her wedding with Aristoteles Onassis, a suit that Monica Vitti used in "The Nights," or a coat of wool and skin belonging to the emperor Fara Dib.
In this audience, the names of the models are Sybilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Tourn und taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria, or Sofia Habsburg.
Nati Abascal and Designer, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unable to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
These were trousers, shirts, vests, and jackets from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Nati Abascal, one of the designers' muse.
"I prefer him to the others for his feminineness, for his great love for women, because he stresses our beauty," adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light in them and they're coming up on his face.
The ratio is perfect.
The princess and fashion-legislator of Patricia's Djovampaol's D'Arenberg can't forget the first time she was dressed in Valentino, either.
When I was a teenager and I lived in Italy, I dreamed I'd have an age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally came that time in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear it for a holiday at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with a snippet, "crushed" into a squirrel and cut without a squirrel.
"It was a dream that came true," said Rodrigo's widow to "Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is extraordinary," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess d'Arenberg keeps her birthday dress from the modeler with "maximum care... because dress is not just a dress, it's also a collection of memories accompanying him."
Fashion King
The grand finale of the exhibit at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls their sewing) to make this silk-coloured piece of ivory with incrusive pearls, twelve species of different laces and a plume of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Susie Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone in the late 20th century, "return of clients from the upper world."
Deluded by the "lifestyle" of the elite for years now Valentino himself is its best representative.
The Grand Cross Cavalry (the character of the highest rank in Italy), the Manor of Arts and Words, the Order of the Legion of Honour, Harvani collected as much honour as any of his clients' spouses.
"Always my attention was drawn to his delicateness, his calmness, his timid and impeccable appearance," says Dr.
The last time I saw him was at a dinner at the Orse Museum a month ago.
He was sitting at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
"He was perfect, time doesn't exist for him."
If the princess says so...
The hardest profession in the world: miners from Cavah Ijena
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of the volcano on steep rock trails
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by sulfur production in the island of Cavah Igen, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfurous gas rising from the deep earth freezes when it comes to air.
Ripping large pieces of gray, whose total weight may be as high as 70 kg, he puts them into two bamboo baskets, he drops the baskets on his shoulders and carries them up on a rocky road.
Up to the top of a volcano of 2,386 meters is only 250 meters high, but exhausted haulers need more than 40 minutes to climb up with a turtle step, struggling to maintain a delicate balance and to navigate the road carefully to avoid falling or falling off the cliff.
They know that one wrong step might cost them their lives, as happened to a tourist from France who had crashed a few years ago from the rocks of Cavah Igen.
Chesters from Kavah Ijeen earn 5 Eurocents for each kilogram of grey they produce.
Upstairs, they pave the way between tourists who photograph them, as if they were monkeys from the circus and, tired of carrying heavy baskets, walked three kilometers to the weights that the mine company had set up a little higher, at a height of 1,850 metres.
This is the PT Candy Ngrimby, a company that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, rather than saying, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for each kilogram of silver.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) of petrochemical production, since it is common in daily life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"Because the norm is 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each walk," explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily moves.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end of the day feels broken, but they allow him to save Rs. 138,000 (Euro11.5) by the end of the day.
Although it seems a miser for such an unhuman effort, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.
"The wages paid to the miners are very high in local terms, where the collection of coffee is paid by Rs. 15,000 (Euro1.2) per day and the average monthly wage is Rs. 2 million (Euro167)", explains a porter who used to work as a bricksmith on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was Rs. 75,000 (Euro6.2) per day and the site was not as heavy as it was, but Anto returned with his family to Bnuwanga, a town near the volcano, for a reason which in Indonesia is as devastating as the sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where there are Hindus, and brought her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto asthma, he breathes hard, coughs constantly, and his eyes are tearing because of the poison gas.
At the age of 27, Anto had spent three years risking himself in Cavah Ijeen, whose grey had already begun to affect him, despite having a mask and special glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are going to cry out because of the poisonous gases that the volcano generates.
That's the price he should pay to achieve his dream.
"I'll work for another two years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than appropriate English.
Life-saved, this nice and smart young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a hotel porter, but instead he performs the job of a mule.
The filthy wooden hut with its other porters, which rises up every day at 2 a.m. because the sulfur never ceases to gush out at night when its distinctive yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
By calling out shadows, Anto descends into a crater, lighting his way with a little lamp connected to his hat, which he himself bought with his money.
About 400 porters carry baskets of gray on their shoulders from the bottom of a volcano
Despite high returns, the mine company did not mechanize the production of sulfur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work on their own account and with such hardships.
In fact, they don't even get a piece of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) for photography, which, in addition to the 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) entrance ticket, the guards of this reserve are charging tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mules.
"This work is for animals, not for people," says Badrusin, a 42-year-old root porter who spent three decades in Cavah Ijeen since he left college.
He's able to raise to 110 kilograms, and he says he's going to take the job "as long as he can," because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because a volcano is my whole life.
Although the gray burns its throat and its eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so patient that no one complains of their severe diseases... more serious, apparently than their usual problems with breathing, arthrosis, knee pains and ulcers on their shoulders, which have been deformed under the weight of the basket.
By balancing the basket on his back, the Unainik can only raise 50 pounds in his 53 ’ s.
Every day he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three truckers carry to a warehouse in Tamansari, traveling 18 kilometers along a narrow trail among the bushes.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano is my whole life," says the Unaigner, opening his mouth wide and missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, older than 30, he also works as a sulfur vector.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult things in the world: what human mules do with Kavah Ijeen.
Singapore is searching for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress and costs of shelter and education for children's absence.
"The people of Singapore need to grow."
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my patriot's wife, we'll do our civil duty and create life!
It may seem incredible that these strings are part of advertising mint cakes, but nevertheless -- or perhaps because of that -- this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like "Let's put a bao in the stove" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes that through advertising they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a entertaining way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their "national duty."
This thing is just for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
That's the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce our own kind, so we felt that this is the subject that we should address.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot of things, like launch spirits with pheromones or organise quick dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we make the most creative of all possible things to solve this problem, that's to compose a rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not take it so lightly are the Singaporean government.
It spends 1,300 dollars a year on politics to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extension of maternity leave and tax relief.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leadership and for its strict social control.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its National Population Authority, is now at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 -- which is known as the replacement rate -- was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more kids?
Tan Wei Min, Director of the Marriage and Family Policy Department of the National Population Authority, says that the reason for the “improved education” and “the wider range of career opportunities” is the reason.
"This has enabled people to have a broader range of options in terms of living goals and priorities, other than marriage and family formation," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriages and the birth of children, resulting in a decline in Singapore ' s birth rate.
Meanwhile, immigration policies, which seek to sharply increase immigration in order to counter population decline, are indignant among the local population.
Singapore has websites that have scarcely concealed xenophobic attitudes towards many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping their wages low and unwilling to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's ruling party last year had had the worst results in elections since independence.
After the elections, there was an attempt to solve the problem through quota and higher taxes on foreign workers.
Unexpected Effects
While falling birth rates have a certain impact on national economic growth, tax revenue, medical spending and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government was endeavouring not to build so many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development manual has moved on to controlling the number of small apartments known as a shoebox that can be built in certain parts of the city.
These apartments, which are 46 square meters, are very well sold.
However, there is a view that they can contribute to a single life and discourage developers who want to build large family homes.
But Lim Yu Sun, Director-General of the EL Developers Construction Company, says that their shoeboxes are sold much faster than larger copies.
They're more popular, in the sense that such apartments buy for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our income is rising.
However, he recognized that the new rules provided clearer guidance to developers who had previously been prevented if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too strained
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the centre, they do not seem to have much effect.
"People are overstretched, shelter is expensive, as is education, and so many people delay it," says the young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important to me to have my own money and time," said another young man 20 years old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and prices of shelter and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, the last word is for Singaporeans.
Personal offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to a dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish, this is a private or “privileged sphere of privacy which has the right to defend against any interference”.
What is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in social media?
Does he understand the dangers of Internet discussions that would certainly not be shared outside the Internet?
ElPeriódico interviewed five youngsters between the ages of 10 and 15, often users of the network.
In four cases they associated the term with "something very mine," in a personal way, and "password and user's name" when they applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't upload to the post," says Jorge, a decade ago, when he tries to explain the meaning of personal on websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had accounts for two years.
"It's very secret, my mom may know them, but not the whole world," he claims.
On FB, I upload beautiful images or images from games.
I also have fun with people I know.
"I wouldn't share a picture that isn't mine, or someone who behaves stupidly," he says.
The boy realizes that it is not good to publish unwelcome pictures of naked people, crimes, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know 35 friends he has on FB and nine of his Twitter followers.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother knows she has a password for one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just upload them," he adds.
"Social networks are entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
Without thinking, he says that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
Wouldn't consider anyone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter acknowledges that he does not know the 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't frighten me, because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one was trusting him or asking for his home address or telephone number.
"If I get pushed or demanded, I'll just remove them from my account," he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask after reading the advice on Twitter.
The boy is not stranger to the experience of what is known today as cybermobbing.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and extorted.
"He never found out who it was," he assures.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete the account.
"Only included privacy."
He then explains the sequence of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or troubled situations.
Yeah, I would if I didn't like a person or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's cybermobbing," he says.
Key issues
Marios Porros, an English teacher and a teacher in education and education, believes that in order to guide children and teenagers, it is necessary to understand that social networks are intended to be informed.
"The Internet has appeared as a means of searching for information, but with the advent of these websites, the rules of the game have changed," she notes.
Porros points out that the academic Mark Prensky, a teacher at the University of Yale and author of the work of digital Aboriginals and immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are they, children and young people born in the age of technology.
"We're digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning ourselves," she says.
Explains that the subject is complex, "because we ask them to have a certain test of what can or cannot be distributed, published or spoken at an age when maturity is not sufficient to do so."
"And they should be selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show what privacy is for children and teenagers is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do this is useless," she adds.
Then Porros lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or would you like to have a picture of you like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know that others publish about you?
When you sign photos from parties, do you ask permission from other people to mark them?
And one thing is, does everybody need to know what you do at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they should behave online as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"Over the Internet, people behave with respect, responsibility and other principles, as well as social media," she claims.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a primary education professor and an education consultant, explains the need for heads of families to read the policies of social networks in good faith.
By understanding each point, they have good reason to talk to children about the preconditions for opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to spread or publish," he said.
According to Gourdia, the key question is to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers."
UNASUR will end without the declaration of Lima
The VIth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the declaration of the Lima Declaration, which was announced earlier and theoretically signed by the seven required participants.
Efe had repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VIrd ordinary meeting of heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the President's Administration had indicated on the front page that it would be handed over after closing, but had then confirmed that it would be published on the website of the Government of Peru at a certain time.
On questions about the text, they indicated that the contents had been submitted by the President of Peru, Oliant Umala, during brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information about the Summit was always restricted.
In the course of the day, only a video of the Presidential Assembly was broadcast in the press hall, with a message that said, "Close meeting, no sound."
A small amount of information which was circulating among reporters was provided by some UNASUR government spokespersons who attended the meeting, but not by Peru.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discontent among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Subsequently, the President's administration sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this is about Umala's statement rather than the official document by which the summit ended.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South American and Arab Summit (ASPA), and the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was also not distributed, despite press insistence.
On the official ASPA website, you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the authorities in Peru had endeavoured to ensure that broadcast systems were provided to all journalists, but had limited access to information as much as possible.
The meeting also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt a verdict of the Court of The Hague, which settles a territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Oliant Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinera, have met at a regional meeting and have ratified that they will abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins on Monday in The Hague the hearing of the statements of both parties, in the context of the charge which Lima has put forward against Santiago.
"We will abide by and execute a decision that will explain the differences that we are currently representing in this international court," said Umala, next to her Chilean colleague.
"Chili was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of differences, pacts and international courts," he added, and greeted Umal with a shake of his hand against the flags of these two countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they were subject to the International Court of Justice took place immediately after Colombia protested this week against the Bogotá pact, according to which it recognized that it was subject to the verdicts of that international court following the decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered incorrect.
The meeting was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseph; Venezuela, Ugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirschner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR had been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former President, Fernando Lugo, had not participated in the meeting.
The host President, Olitta Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and for closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The Head of State had read the outcome document, in which he had reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and action lines had been approved for 31 projects among South American countries, and that the expected investment amounted to $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries would take “important steps towards the purpose of South American citizenship for which we are extending the settlement agreement”.
He reported that action was being taken to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizens' uncertainty and organized transnational crime, action to increase access to drugs, low-cost Internet access in all parts of South America and to take into account the combined and effective risks of natural disasters”.
Since Europe is in crisis, “the economic union (Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our productive base and foreshadow a better future for our cities,” Oomala added.
"We decided to grant privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that would improve South America's communications, especially in the village and border areas ... bringing our countries together and forming new economic schemes," the President of Peru said in a read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were from Peru and were confined to transverse axes on its territory, from coast to Brazil, while two were intended to have a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide any more details.
The outcome document also addressed the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in that country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations," from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united and to have good relations among its neighbours was another theme highlighted at the Summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said that, before taking part in the regional meeting, he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City, to conduct a respectful negotiation of the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of an international court challenged by Bogotá.
"The next morning (saturday), perhaps meet President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"Let's renegotiate all these ways, they're not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Hortega, I hope I can tell him that we can deal with this as civilly and respectfully as possible," he added.
Santos and Hortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they are scheduled to attend the new President of that country, Henrique Peña Nieto.
Also in the framework of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc met in advance to approve the Action Plan for 2013, which aims to enhance dialogue and unanimity on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Guyana, Suriname, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela formed UNASUR, although the latter had been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the Regional Block.
"South America must learn from Europe on the issue of integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, has confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is the goal of "South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VIth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, said to Peru's public television that Europeans had "killed each other during the Second World War" and in other clashes, "but now they're almost the same country."
It defended, in this context, the South American citizenship project, which was endorsed by the UNASUR participating countries.
"There must be free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reaction sectors that want us back in the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador has also been a supporter of the resuming of the Organization of American States (OAS), with a view to reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San Jose Human Rights Pact.
The lecturers never make any promises, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington, D.C., and is financed by the United States," he said, hinting at the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa affirmed that he did not regret this decision because with him he did not betray his principles, but rather respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that there were “some suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be followed”.
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding to come to his territory for questioning the alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish law itself considers it possible to carry out it by means of a video conference which could be made available to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London”.
Correa confirmed that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will decline.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the messenger informed me that he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian Head of State.
What's really happening is the risk of a decline in his physical and mental health due to being confined to a small space without being able to exercise in the air.
"It affects any person's health," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum problem granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London by providing a security guarantee that would enable him to go to Ecuador was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that there had been talks in London to find a solution to the problem of the WikiLeaks founder's imprisonment.
We are not engaged in human rights talks; we do not use that word here, but we have had constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European courts, because assange's lawyer, Balthasar Garson, runs a number of trials in various European instances," he mentioned.
And he thought, "If the United Kingdom gives tomorrow a security guarantee, it'll end."
And if Sweden, as well as it allows its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interviews him on Skype, the problem will be over tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to act as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he did not tolerate “mediocy, integrity or lies which distorted freedom of expression”.
"The main enemies of freedom of the press are not corrupted politicians, but bad journalists who support gain, blackmail and blackmail," he said.
In this respect, he remained pleased that neither these journalists nor “the bankers nor the bourgeois hegemon countries dominate Ecuador” and added that, having re-elected, “will deepening the revolution to continue development in the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the Paraguayan veto in UNASUR at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the mask of the rule of law” because, in fact, “it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy”.
The President of Ecuador also considered the “full reason” for his Colombian colleague, Juan Manuel Santos, to pursue discussions with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which had proved to be in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At present, this decision has not been implemented.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflict is inevitable, but must be overcome by the desire to go together.
They need to be processed together in order to overcome them and move forward.
He also expressed the hope that the maritime boundary dispute which Peru and Chile had before the same court would be well concluded and said that it was “true for Latin America to apply to international bodies if the two countries pledged to take a decision, however difficult it might be”.
With regard to the opportunity to stand as a candidate for Ecuador's upcoming Presidential elections to run for a third consecutive term, he indicated that he was considering this possibility “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is rather difficult”.
Correa assured me that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would quit public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unjust situations as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I had to accept that responsibility," he said.
If you win, it would be my last term as President, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
"This is the decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned the new treatment of Venezuelan President Ugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Venezuelan Vice President, Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to the treatment that had already been scheduled to be routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean the health of President Chávez," he explained.
The Head of State of Ecuador took part in the VIth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
Death from AIDS today is the result of late diagnosis
The factory was 21 years old when it was announced that its analysis on AIDS had yielded a positive result.
"I've been deafened," he remembers, despite the doctor's tactics, the moment.
The boy kept it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the disease himself, he wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts were justified -- he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
The Fabrizio, one of the "oldest" patients in the HCGH hospital, has overcome a number of obstacles.
He's been living with a diagnosis of the human accumulation virus (HlV) for 22 years, and in the early 1990s it would be hard to believe that there were too few treatments then, too few people who knew about the disease, and too biased about the sick.
So even the director of the hospital at the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say good-bye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, at that time, having AIDS was a sentence.
Now it's possible to survive this syndrome and do it without compromising the quality of life.
However, without knowing about their disease, many people still come when the virus has already damaged their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
Thirty-one years after the advent of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "the greatest achievement to date is that the patient's survival, who begins treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," pointed out the head of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, invoking that this information was confirmed in April this year by a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008 researchers have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but that the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system available to patients at the start of diagnosis, with a better life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years with 500 CD4 reported.
Simply put, the above means that a person who gets diagnosed as positive at age 25 will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age, he explained.
To measure this progress, one should remember that the average lifespan of Mexicans today is 76 years.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has dropped from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (the annual report of the United Nations Development Programme (UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since the emergence of AIDS.
Only in Jalisco had 255 people died in 2011 and 187 had died by May; however, it has been argued that there has been widespread access to anti-retroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still fatal results?
- Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I picture it. That's how things are in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years we had no shortage of drugs, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their infection, that is, at the late stages of the disease.
He gave devastating data: "Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some sort of opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnostics at an earlier stage, and therefore to provide samples for detection on a massive scale to all people who ask for it."
In his proposal, experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of Aids in Jalisco (COESIDA) as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a private laboratory for testing only because his friend had done so and, despite his young age, he had already been in the stage of AIDS and had even suffered from Caposhi's sarcoma, a cancer that was one of the common symptoms.
Things change when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they'll die, and they don't want to know.
"If I die anyway, I'd rather get drunk three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, I do exercises, I take drugs.
To date, his parents only know that he's had cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of classes, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and another person," recounted Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO in order to encourage by his statement those who are now, in the context of World AIDS Day, afraid.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they are positive, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person who is responsible.
His presentation summed up the theme of the fight against AIDS this year.
Condoms on the counter
Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who was addressing the issue of HIV, claims to be a huge gap between health programs and ordinary citizens.
And the biggest is prevention.
In the places on this subject, "in fact, there's been an increase in the distribution of condoms, before we got one or two, now we're getting a hundred packets, and that's very good, but it turns out there's people who don't have access to a condom right now," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"Why do you want them?" this popular question, with a hunch and a conviction, by social workers, school counsellors, pharmacists, and health workers, who don't want to hear from teenagers, was reassured by the propaganda.
I suggest that this inefficient distribution be changed; that the condoms be not just behind the counters, and that a hundred be placed in machine-guns in public toilets in places often visited by young people.
It's not promiscuity.
It was not about paying for a beer or a motel, and the governor, Emilio Gonzalez, replied when asked if it was possible to hand out a condom under his direction.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms accessible to those who are already practising sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Jalisco
There were 13.435 registered cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The state is ranked 4 in the national ratings for new and cumulative cases of AIDS and number 13 in the national ratings for HIV.
92% of infection is related to sex, 6% through blood and 2% through peri-path.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know about it.
In view of the United States Court of Appeal's approval of a decision that nullifies the rescheduling of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a fatal precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country that has problems with capacity to pay.
It seems that procedures to support the survival of Mexican companies do not seem to be valid in the country, contrary to international arrangements.
In practice, the approval of the 15 June decision of Judge Harlin Hale in the North Texas Bankruptcy Court leaves defenceless Mexican companies in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on the other side of Rio Grande.
However, the order opens the doors of a leading glass maker in Mexico to apply to the United States Supreme Court, proving three inconsistencies.
As an introduction, while the trial judge notes that the lenders must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceeding concerns a competitive proceeding in Mexico.
The first paragraph implied the revocation of international judicial cooperation in cases of the insolvency of multinational businesses.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law had been created for that purpose and the American Institute of Law had been appointed as an arbiter.
Secondly, the verdict states that without an inter-firm vote, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved, recognized in the critical mass of competitive debt production which Vitro branches had owed to the parent company.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-firm debts have been guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Businesses.
It is also true that, by subtracting the votes of branches, Vitro's lenders, who fought against it in United States courts, such as vulture foundations such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority.
The vote would be 45 percent to 37 percent.
This information is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation she has faced since 2008 as a result of the serious economic crisis that the United States has experienced in its attacks on the country.
So far, the family firm of Gonzalez Sada will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself, so that the vote will reach its Plenum, i.e. five judges, because only three have voted.
In the event of failure, a request for a certificate will be submitted, which will require a review of the trial by the High Court, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
Worse still, the court rejected a document submitted by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae ("a friend of the court"), describing the process followed by Vitro under the Competitive Processing Act, indicating that it was exonerated from the agreements signed by both countries in order to link it to section 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
It is also observed that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cases of inter-State insolvency that guarantee equality between the debtors and the lenders.
Carambol from two sides: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Total balance
In view of the months-long pending complaints put on the table by the Mexicana de Aviación trade union against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrage Andrade, who is accused of fraud, the Trade Union Association of Aviator Pilots has already discovered a bottleneck throat.
Carlos Díaz Chávez Morino has just submitted a criminal complaint against the National Commission on Banks and Securities, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the monitoring body has systematically refused to submit reports to the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Republic concerning an operation carried out by the employer to extract 198 million Peso from the trust fund of the F/589 bank IXE, on behalf of the Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be directed towards the purchase of shares by a professional hotel management company.
As you know, Ascarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel network.
Draw Mart Circles
Having met at the Caribbean University for a weekend, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, researchers, businessmen and members of general civil society endorsed the creation of a broad front to counter the opening of the Chinese Dragon Martin in Cancún.
We're talking, as you know, about a giant marketing and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for 150 companies.
Canacintra had previously succeeded in merging the governors of the south-east zone to counter the monumental forces that had levelled off some protected areas and put serious threats on the industry.
ACTA Death
With regard to the Government's request to the Senate to explain under what circumstances and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan had signed a trade agreement against counterfeiting, known as an acronym in the English ACTA, according to the Mexican Industrial Property Institute, the case had already been archived.
As you know, the action has been carried out, despite the fact that the senate itself has disqualified the possibility of considering it as a breach of freedom of expression in social media.
Homex in the Long term
In an effort to settle long-term debt without affecting the short-term, the home developer has placed 500 million Peso certificates on the market.
Release is the first of four identical, with an offer of interest every 28 days.
Competival appears in the world
Created by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, an information technology leader, a competition with the trade name Competival has just emerged, its goal will be to market software clusters in Central and South America.
Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 billion.
"Heatin" by Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
The envious basketball traveller, Heatin, Reyes, had been associated with this sport for over 60 years and, thanks to it, had to travel around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as the Heatin Reyes.
And for, before the brain hemorrhage in 2008, Reyes was absorbed into a wheelchair for over 60 years, as a player of small categories, a player of the High Basketball League, authorized and BSN leader with the Baaemon Cowboys and the President of the Basketball Federation.
"I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including at the same time as I was President BSN, Director General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes remembers during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with her, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate by making that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with pictures and memorable things collected on his long journey, are evidence of this.
Bayamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys, from the mid 1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years as a co-agent or contract agent.
"It was my best years, which I enjoyed most because I was able to be part of eight Cowboy championships since 1967, as an agent, as a co-agent or leader.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Minsey's BSN debut.
From that moment on, he became the "Cuckoo" of Ortis, who was the great administrator," Reyes pointed out.
I remember that Gene Bartov, who was on his way here and was at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, said to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7."
"Do you want to?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of Puerto Rico's best players.
Bartov then recommended a sniper named Raimond Gauss, who became a citizen and one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Mincey had brought the championship to Bayamon, Goose would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboys' championship with Gauss, but I was already away because by 1988 I was the head of the Federation.
By then, I had preferred to enjoy his achievements and those of Mincey in the national team.
I remember the first time we won from the United States during the 1989 Mexican championship tournament.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we won fourth place, and it was supposed to be a bronze, had it not been for the Canadian judge who forced us to overplay the final game, Reyes said.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She was among the best, as was the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Games.
But my favorite was the one from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991 when we won the gold and smashed the U.S. team, which was quite like the one that won the armor at the World Cup.
Not only did Minci, Gaussa, Ramona Rivas, Fico López and Piculin (Ortisa) play the team again, but also the young (Havier) "Tonyto" Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (France and Edgar) and Mario "Kichote" Morales, who were unable to participate in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of the staff, but which has brought us a gold coin and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Oslo Qualifications tournament in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role players like Canito Nieves, Pablo Alice, and young Rolando Hurrouitner instead of those temporarily suspended for messing up in the Panama City Mar del Plata championship, we won gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortis.
His performance at international tournaments is remarkable.
No one in Puerto Rico had dominated that level in the way Piculin did.
And that doesn't take into account his career in the various leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Thoreau, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raimmond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think is your main achievement in the Federation?
Attended the most famous national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s BSN had up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have to do?
There were things I wanted to realize, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponce play only in their own region and only against teams from other parts of the island in national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that's unnecessary.
At least I see the results of the mandatory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my age on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and sometimes go to basketball games.
And, of course, enjoying the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always with me.
The actor Larry Hagman died.
LARRY Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Wyth, Texas, became world-renowned for his main role as John Ross Ewing, more known as J.R., in a television series called Dallas, in which he represented a businessman without principles, evil or manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as J.R. Yuing's oil tycoon in the Dallas TV series became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died on Friday evening due to cancer-induced complications, according to a family statement given to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the Dallas production studio.
"Larry returned to his favorite hometown Dallas, again playing the symbolic role he liked most," said his family.
The Larry family and their closest friends were with him in Dallas at the thanksgiving fair.
Lynda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and the sequel, was next to Hagman when he died at the Dallas hospital, said her representative, Geoffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, gentle and talented, and I'll miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," affirmed Gray in the statement.
He was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted to having been drinking for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumours in his liver and had a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman became famous on television because of the role of a decent type in the easy comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changing when he meets the attractive girl of the jean, who is played by Barbra Iden, and starts living with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character of the two comedy that rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included well-received roles by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his craftsmanship that brought Hagman to the top of his glory.
The CBS drama show about the Yuings and other characters around it aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who shot J.R.?" designed to create a fuss about an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character almost killed, generated international discussions and millions of dollars at risk in bookstores.
It also helped to attract a record audience back then.
When the November 1980 episode was answered, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned the Dallas into the second largest feature of the entertainment program in history, after the "MASH" final in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (in the performance of Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. interrupted her and then threatened her with being accused of being involved in prostitution if she did not get out of town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Yuing as an insatiable corrupter with a charismatic smile: an dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his wife to be treated by Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what should be on the J.R." said Hagman in 1988.
It must say, "Here lies an honest citizen of J.R. Ewing."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Princeipal, also a character of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone "growing, both on and off the screen."
It is memorable and indispensable to millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who have had the privilege of knowing and loving it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas issue were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT.
Five episodes of the second season and six were already in production, reported the channel.
Warner or TNT have not yet announced what happens to the show after Hagman's departure.
Born of Fort-Wert, Texas, he was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martin, who was brilliant in classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to Ben Hagman.
He tried to be happy on the theatre scenes of New York in the early 1950s and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, May Axelson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many famous people live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I thought would hurt anybody or affect them in any way," he said to Prenza Asociada at the time.
After a liver transfer, he began promoting organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients with fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they go into surgery, and after," he pointed out in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Starting a course that explores the end of the world.
Every week students study apocalyptic phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this semester, when professor of religion, Edward Charme, decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible bait: the end of the Maya calendar, December 21, for which many people had seized themselves as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Charme had no idea what was coming in the next couple of months: the devastating hurricane Sandi, the financial crisis that some call the long-armeddon, and the growing conflict that Israel is taking in, a place where Christian end-of-time theorists believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," said Charma this week to the students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey.
If you look at what's happening in the world today, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember, bad things are good for those with apocalyptic thoughts.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the end of the world in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, professor Barry Walker holds a course on media, culture and the end of the world.
Every week students study apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We're examining why these ideas are spreading over time," he said, and the way they're presented with hypothetical scenarios that cause certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of a terrorist, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed movies on apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to examples from real life.
"I tried to tell the students what might be plausible and impossible," said Walker.
At the University of Pennsylvania, professor of Latin American history, Matthew Restall, and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art and anthropology, merged to read a course called the End of the World.
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again in case the end of the world doesn't come," said Restall.
Despite the "immediate destruction," students have to study, prepare projects and take final exams.
At Penn State the final exam will be accepted on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work "until the very night in which the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
Courses have turned out to be quite popular.
"The place ended in two hours," said Restall about his course for students with high average scores, for which 35 students registered.
We received e-mail messages many weeks before the beginning of the semester from people who were asking if there was room left.
The students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student in the department of religion and social science from Hudsonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And apocalyptic thinking, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will Vequez, a 25-year-old student in psychology and sisterhood, said he was watching all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a course to teach it," he remarked.
I like him.
But none of the students surveyed -- let alone the professor -- said he believed in December 21st.
"Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it," said Julie Sieglen, a 21-year-old student at the University of Temple of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; this is just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he pointed out that there is apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which has a number of centuries, where people react to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Preferably in an English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question whether he knew about any course on the end of the world there.
"The Philippines does not take part at the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at the superior's orders.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall drew attention to the long history of many days of the last trial, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
The students and teachers take care of this date.
Some said they're going to end-of-the-world parties.
"Perhaps I'll call one of my friends to laugh together," remarked Samira Ford, a 20-year-old telecommunications student.
