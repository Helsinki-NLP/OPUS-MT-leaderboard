The rapidly growing coronavirus infection rate (COVID-19) in the European Union and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The cumulative coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, thus confirming that, despite different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemonium is rapidly increasing in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to improve their readiness for the inflow of patients with COVID-19, who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown ethos were reported in Wuhan Province of China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Control reported that the infection was caused by a new type of coronavirus, now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-COV-2 has become known as coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, about 80 percent of people with COVID-19 are suffering from a slight infection, i.e. from pneumonia-free or pneumonia-infected diseases, and most of them are cured.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 is developing into a more severe hospital condition, while in the rest 6% is in a critical form when intensive treatment is required.
The mortality rate for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is about 4%.
This study examines trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) country and in the United Kingdom and compares them with those of the Province of Hubey in China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom with data for Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom
After the explosion in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemonium is now developing in the rest of the world according to the same dynamic as that of China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 Pandemic.
In the issue of Eurosurveillance dated 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria for WHO to determine the incidence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on 24 January 2020, with all three cases coming back from Wuhan Province of Hubei.
As at 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had detected cases of COVID-19 infection, with 39,768 cases reported between 31 December 2019 and 1,727 cases, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 fatal cases, were reported in Italy alone.
Definition of cumulative quantity and cumulative disease of COVID-19
The European Centre for disease control and prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8 a.m. data on the number of registered cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world from official sources such as those of health, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK and to compare them with data for Italy.
COVID-19 was calculated as an indicator of the rate of incidence of active COVID-19 in 14 days, taking into account the normal COVID-19 flow in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country on 8:00-15 March 2020, compared to the data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and in Great Britain
Trends in the 14-day cumulative COVID-19 incidence in EU/EEA countries and in Britain were generally in line with trends observed in the Chinese Province of Hubey (figure 1).
The cumulative COVID-19 incidence in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom as a whole began to rise about 21 February and a sharp leap occurred on 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but in all other EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom there were similar trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, compared with that of Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already registered as at 8 a.m. on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom is similar to that recorded in Italy only about three weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of registered COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom.
Current trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite the different steps in different countries, the differences in the response of national public health authorities, and perhaps the different criteria for the recognition of cases and the different rules for the selection of patients for COVID-19 testing, including “up-to-date” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive therapy, while the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions were already as full as possible.
Currently, data on the admission of patients from COVID-19 to hospitals and (or) the EU/EEA Intensive Care Unit are only available for 6% and 1% respectively (not reported).
However, there is a need to systematically collect such data in order to supplement current data on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths.
According to a study carried out in 2010-2011, there is a considerable difference in the number of beds in intensive care and in intensive care services in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in beds per 100 000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care services per 100,000 population in 2010 - 2011).
The sixth update of the ESCD risk assessment report on COVID-19 provides scenarios for the simulation of the health system resource load with estimates of the hospitalization of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, where the risk of a shortage of available beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.
Since the cases are now grouped into certain EU/EEA and British regions, and hospitals and intensive care offices usually serve the population of a certain area, information on infection cases and the number of beds in intensive care units is recommended to provide, as far as possible, level 2 Nomenclatures of Area Units for Statistics (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom the COVID-19 Pandemic is rapidly developing.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for a long-term SARS-COV-2 contact scenario and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as can be seen, for example, in affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest ESCR report on the results of the rapid risk assessment, a rapid, preventative and integrated approach is important to curb the spread of SARS-COV-2, moving from containment to minimization, as, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision-makers and hospitals may not have sufficient time to understand, take and adjust their responses as appropriate unless such measures are taken in advance.
The report on the results of the rapid risk assessment also listed public health measures designed to reduce the impact of the epidemic.
The countries have only a short period of time in which they can step up their monitoring efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-COV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries will experience a flood of patients who will need intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The coronavirus infection of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of type 2, has become a tragedy for humanity: to date, more than 3,000 people have died in China and elsewhere and more than 80,000 people have been infected.
Like the Homological SARS-CoV virus, which caused severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-COV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower incidence of disease and a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older persons more frequently than young people and men more frequently than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on new diseases, this article provides a relevant and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving subject of the study.
We'll look at basic aspects of epidemiology, ethology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction and prevention of the disease.
While many questions have yet to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate a dangerous disease.
The spring holiday (China's New Year), which fell on January 25, 2020, was an unprecedented and memorable event for all Chinese, who were urged to stay at home for weeks due to the outbreak of a new virus infection.
Due to the high degree of similarity with the coronavirus (Cov), which caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) explosion in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the virus SARS-COV-2 on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease was known as coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout the country and then in nearly 50 other countries around the world.
On 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been detected, and over 40,000 patients had recovered and more than 3,000 patients had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a “number one enemy to society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nich.gov/publicmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have appeared in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, ethology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of a virus separated from a number of patients.
The review is an attempt to summarize research results in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus-induced diseases, the coronavirus of the Middle East Respirator Syndrome (MERS), which erupted in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts about the prevention and prediction of the current disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronaviruses were traditional pathogens, which are not deadly to humans and are mostly responsible for about 15% of the total respiratory diseases.
However, in this century we have twice encountered highly pathogened human coronaviruses, i.e. the coronavirus of severe acute respirator syndrome (SARS-COV-2) and the coronavirus of the Middle East Respirator Syndrome (MERS-COV), which caused an outbreak of diseases from the beginning in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to many other States with appalling levels of disease and mortality.
Hence, the present COVID-19 is the third coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a report on the cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin was first submitted to the National Health Commission of the PRC from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, a genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death occurred in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, health workers were reported to be infected, suggesting that the virus could be transmitted from humans to humans.
On 23 January, a quarantine was introduced in the city of Wuhan and the city's public transport service ceased.
On 24 January, according to a first medical study of the disease, 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered a starting point for infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that a coronavirus explosion was a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had spread across China and had already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
Given the rapid evolution of the situation, the final scale and degree of risk of an explosion have yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centric hospital study, which involved 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, provided the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
Infected by SARS-COV-2 were all age groups, but mostly people between 30 and 65 years of age were affected.
Nearly half (47.7 percent) were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-COV-2 infection among men is higher (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was distributed by clusters mainly in Hubei Province and nearby regions.
On average, 5 days (2–9) have elapsed between the moment the symptoms of COVID-19 were shown and the diagnosis has been made.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0–7.2).
From the moment the symptoms occurred until death, the average number of days was 9.5 (4.8 to 13 days).
The base value (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the corrected R0 was 2.23-4.882.
By January 23, 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infections, which coincided with large-scale transport on the eve of the Chinese New Year.
The mortality rate for patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10 - 1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate for patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02 - 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were sex (male), age (×60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a sub-family of large silk viruses containing one thread of the RNA.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta-coronaviruses are known to affect people.
In the case of coronaviruses of type SARS and MERS, glycoprothein of spike-like strata (S) is associated with cellular fusions of type 2 angiotenzine-transforming enzyme (ACE2) and diptidyl peptidesis 4 (DPP4), respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
In cytoplasm, the virus RNA genome is released; after replication of the virus genome, the genome RNA, along with the glycoproteins and proteins of the nucleocopsis, generates viron-containing vectors, which then blend with the membrane cell, freeing the virus.
The first SARS-COV-2 genome sequence reports appeared on January 10, 2020.
SARS-COV-2 is found to be a new type of beta-coronavirus, whose genome is 99.98% similar to the 10 sequences collected in the first hot spot of a disease, in the Juanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-COV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-COV than to MERS-COV.
SARS-COV-2 particles were found in ultra-tense human breath epithelics using an electronic microscope.
The human enzyme ACE2 has been found to be a recipe for SARS-COV-2, as well as for SARS-COV.
However, S-protheine SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the ACE2 enzyme of a person that is weaker than in the case of SARS-COV, which explains the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes patients with a lower degree of severity than SARS-COV.
SARS-COV-2 can also generate previously unknown short-lived protein encoded orf3b and secretly encoded orf8.
Orf3b of the SARS-COV-2 virus can play a role in terms of the virus's pathogen and suppress the expression IFNß; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a group of authors led by Zhou (Zhou) submitted reports on the cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-length ACE2 human enzyme with a resolution of 2.9 Å at the B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed information, was collected as a dimster and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-protenins, which is evidence of coronavirus recognition and infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-COV-2 infection.
Origin and Intermediate Owner
It is known that both SARS-COV and MERS-COV were sources of bats from which the virus was transmitted to humans through liquor and camels, respectively.
The phylogenetic comparison of SARS-COV-2 with other coronaviruses found that the first owners of SARS-COV-2 were bats, since the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely, the coronaviruses of SL-COVX45 and SL-COVZX21.
However, it remains unknown which species has become the intermediate host, which has enabled the virus to break the species barrier and infect humans, and the way of transmission has yet to be determined.
Mr. Jiy (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the vectors of the virus from bats to humans were snakes, resulting in a homogeneous recombination in the S-protin.
Based on their research, Chinese researchers from Guangzhou suggested that the pangolins, long-formed mammals that eat ants and are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate owners of SARS-Cov-2; this assumption is based on a 99 percent genetic resemblance between the pangoline coronavirus and the SARS-Cov-2.
However, the difference of 1% distributed between both genomes is still very large, so it is assumed that the final results with specific evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-COV-2 are mostly still unknown.
Under laboratory conditions, SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive for 48 hours in dry conditions and up to 5 days at a temperature below 20°C and between 40% and 50% wet.
SARS-COV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-COV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heat up to 56°C within 30 minutes; it can be effectively blocked by ester, 75% ethyl alcohol, Chlorine-disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid, Chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not by Chlor-hexidine.
Human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-COV-2, so people are vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-COV-2.
So we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, especially SARS-COV and MERS-COV (Figure 4).
Typically, the virus that hits the host first detects the inborn immune system by means of image-recognizing recipes, including electron C-type, toll-like recipes, NOD-like recipes, and RIG-I-like recipes.
Through various mechanisms, the virus results in the exhilaration of inflammation factors, the maturity of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type-I interferones, which prevent the spread of the virus and accelerate the fagocytosis of macrofags with respect to viral antigens.
However, the SARS-COV N-Selk can prevent an immune reaction.
Soon an adaptive immune response is included in the fight against the virus.
T-limphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
T-cells CD4+ stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and T-cells CD8+ directly kill virus-infected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytoquines that help protect cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit T cell functions by causing their programmed death.
Humoral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies from a cured patient neutralized MERS-COV.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system results in the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst scenario lead to polyorganic failure and even death.
The SARS-COV-2 infection, which is a clustered infection, is more likely to affect older persons with associated pathology and pregnant women.
The risk of infection is higher for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have immune problems.
According to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period SARS-COV-2 is between 1 and 14 days, mostly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days, with a difference of 0 to 24 days.
More recently, a study based on a demography of 8,866 cases showed that the incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2).
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the time frame for quarantine measures to take into account the most accurate calculation of the length of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by those infected with the disease without symptoms.
It is common practice to have a 14-day quarantine for persons who have had contact with the virus or are infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and primary symptom of COVID-19 is often high temperature, which can be the only symptom or be accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficult breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, sneeze, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and puking.
Some patients suffered from acute and (or) hypoxy during the week after the disease began.
In severe cases, the disease has rapidly progressed, and patients have developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulosis.
High-temperature patients and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis, even if there are no pathology on the chest.
A demographic study carried out in late December 2019 found the following symptoms: 98% high temperature, 76% dry cough, 55% breath and 3% diarree; 8% required artificial lung ventilation.
Similar results were obtained from two recent studies of cases of domestic infection and transmission of the virus from unsymptomous infections.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-COV, who also had high temperature (98%), dry cough (47%) and breath (55%).
However, 80 percent of them needed artificial lung venting, a rate much higher than for patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate for MERS than for patients with COVID-19.
MERS patients also had diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperature (99–100%), dry cough (29–75%), breath (40–42%), diarree (20–25%) and throat pain (13–25%), and artificial lung venting is required from 14–20%.
As at 14 February, COVID-19 had mortality of 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide had reached 66,576.
Compared to this, SARS had mortality rate of 10 percent by November 2002 of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a population study carried out in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
As a result of a earlier study, the base value for reproduction (R0) for SARS-COV-2 was set at 6.47 at 95% confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, while R0 for SARS-COV was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-COV-2 with MERS-COV and SARA-COV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is given in Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-COV-2 is more proliferable than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but the mortality rate for infection with the new virus is lower than that of the latter two.
So it will be much harder to contain the SARS-COV-2 epidemic than the MERS-COV and SARS-COV epidemics.
Cluster activity often occurs when infection occurs within the same family or group of people who have assembled for any reason or have been on a transport, such as a cruise ship.
The patients often went to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there or had contact with the infected or sick persons during the past two weeks before the disease began.
However, according to the reports, people can bear the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, while cured patients can, after being released from the hospital, again become carriers of the virus, and this is a warning signal for the extension of the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells (in particular lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 have been diagnosed with white blood cells < 4×109/L, including white blood cells < 1×109/L, as well as increased aperture-aminotransfusion and virus.
Some patients found elevated levels of liver enzyme, muscular enzyme and myoglobin in their blood, while most patients experienced elevated levels of C-reactive protein and blood cells.
In patients with severe disease, the D-dimer level, the product of the blood fibrine decay was raised and the number of lymphocytes was steadily decreasing.
Most patients with COVID-19 have found pathology in their chest X-rays showing unequal obscuration on both sides or obscuration of the type of "match glass" in their lungs.
Atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary damage and acute respiratory disease (ARI) are common among patients.
In the case of ADHDs, uncontrollable inflammation, accumulation of liquid and advanced fibrosis result in a significant gas exchange.
Types I and II pneumocytes reduce surface-activated compounds and increase surface tension, thus reducing the ability of lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung fall.
Thus, the worst results of the X-ray study often match the most serious cases.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the separation of pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membrane and inter-taneal lymphocyter infiltration, and the multi-nuclear syncytic cells in the lungs of patients who died of the disease were consistent with viral infection pathology and the ORZ and were found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The main criteria used for the diagnosis of COVID-19 was the detection method for RNA SARS-COV-2 by means of a polymeraceous retrieval chain reaction (reverse-transcryption PCR).
However, given the high level of negative results that could accelerate the epidemic, China began to diagnose on the basis of a clinical diagnosis on 13 February 2020 (not relying solely on the back-transcrypted CPR).
The same was true of the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine data from the history of the disease, from the clinical experience, from laboratory tests and from the results of the X-ray study.
On February 14, 2020, a team of experts led by Mr. Feng Zhang described the protocol for the application of SHERLOCK, based on a repetition of CRISPR, to detect SARS-COV-2; this method allows for the detection of synthetic fragments of the SARS-COV-2 RNA at a density of 20 x 10–18 moles/l to 200 × 10–18 mole/l (10–100 copies per microlitre of reference) using tracer strips in less than an hour without the use of sophisticated equipment.
This new method, if successfully tested for the treatment, can significantly increase the vulnerability and convenience of testing.
Due to the lack of experience in resisting the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors are mostly able to provide patients with COVID-19 only with support therapy, while attempting to use any therapeutic methods used or offered in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other virus diseases (table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of anti-virus drugs, immune agents, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even plasma be used to treat cured patients.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to control the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-COV-2 attacks mainly lungs, and may also affect to a lesser extent other organs that express ACE2 like the gastrointestinal tract and the neurological renal.
However, work failure and respiration are the main threat and cause of patient death.
Thus, in order to ease symptoms and save lives, it is critical to support the breathing function, including general Oxygen therapy, high Oxygen Concentration, non-invasive Artificial Ventilation and invasive Lung Mechanical Ventilation, which is determined by the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporal membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary circulation method used to treat life-threatening cardiovascular or breathing conditions.
In addition, maintaining the water-salt balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital functions are critical for patients with SARS-CV-2.
It is known that the cytokin storm is the result of hyperreaction of patients with SARS and MERS viruses.
The Cytokin storm is a form of a system inflammatory process that develops in response to the selection of a series of cytokines, including TNFAA, IL-1bit, IL-2, IL-6, IFNAX, IFNB, IFN# and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immunocytes to eject huge amounts of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of RHDs and polyorganic insufficiency.
In treating the cytokin storm, especially in the case of patients in difficult condition, suppressing immunity is of the utmost importance.
Corticosteroids and tocilismumabs, monoclonic antibodies, served as interlequine 6 inhibitor, were used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other methods for treating the Cytokin storm based on the suppression of immunity include modulation of the immune response directed at controlling the T cells; blocking the production of Cytokines IFN-1, IL-1, and TNF; suppressing the ginus-kinase; using the coconutomob, cytokine signal oppressors 4 and hisstondeacetalas ingibiters.
Steroids are commonly used as agents of immunity to reduce the severity of inflammatory processes when treating SARS viruses.
However, high dosage steroids are not useful in treating severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially awascular osteonocrosis, which significantly worsens the prediction.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium dosages are recommended for application with caution when treating patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no confirmed effective anti-virus therapy.
However, the infusion of the remdesivirus, the nucleotide analogue, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivirus is a newly developed anti-virus drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola viruses and the Marburg virus.
Later, the Remdesire also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with single-chain RNAs, including those of MERS and SARS.
Based on this data, Gilead has provided this drug to China for a couple of studies on patients living with SARS-COV-2, and the results are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricithyleneb, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavirus and ribavirin were suggested as possible options for treating patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with lopinavirus/ritonavirus may be accompanied by diarree, nausea, puke, liver failure and other side effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other drugs assigned to patients should be monitored with caution.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibodies
The collection of blood from patients cured of contagious diseases has been used for the treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease or for the protection of healthy populations for a long time.
Indeed, the blood of recovered patients often contains relatively high amounts of antibodies to combat pathogen.
Antibodies are in the immunoglobulin produced by B-limphocytes to control pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual molecules of pathogens and target them.
Based on this condition, plasma was extracted from blood samples from a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19, which was then introduced to 10 seriously ill patients.
Within 24 hours their symptoms improved, acute inflammation and viral stress decreased, and blood saturation increased.
However, in order to suggest that this method should be used massively before specific therapy is carried out, untested and uncompleted explanations are required.
In addition, given the therapeutic effect, some shortcomings associated with the use of plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can over-instimate the immune system and cause Cytokin release syndrome, which, given the risk of being poisonous, is a potential risk to life.
The concentration of antibodies in blood is usually low, and plasma is needed to treat patients in critical condition.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat the global epidemic.
It is therefore more important and more practical to separate the B cells of recovered patients and to determine the genetic code of effective antibodies or to screen to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can go straight to the massive production of antibodies.
For thousands of years, Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on a combination of multiple components of a formula that differs depending on diagnosis of a disease based on Chinese traditional medicine.
Most effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, as it is difficult to separate and verify these components or to test their optimum combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific treatment of COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative methods for treating patients with mild and moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from the severe stage of the disease.
For example, the Su Feng Jie Du capsules and the Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest rate of recovery of patients with COVID-19 was found in a number of provinces in China, where 87 percent of patients were treated with traditional Chinese medicine, including Gansu (63.7 percent), Ninsa (50 percent) and Hunan (50 percent), while in Hubei Province, where only about 30 percent of patients with COVID-19 were treated with Chinese traditional medicine, the lowest rate of recovery (13 percent).
However, this is a rather rough comparison, since evaluation must take into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively with Western medicine and combination of treatment based on Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the time frame for normalizing body temperature, removing symptoms and providing hospital care was considerably shorter for patients who had been treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients who had been treated only in Western medicine.
Most surprising is the fact that the percentage of patients who began to suffer symptoms (from ease to severity) was markedly lower in the group, which was treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine, than in the group, which was treated by Western methods only (7.4 per cent, compared to 46.2 per cent), while the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8 per cent, compared to 39 per cent).
However, the efficiency and security of Chinese traditional medicine still require more carefully monitored research on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of interest if possible to have a description of the mechanism and an explanation of the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine or a combination of them.
The patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 are mostly acutely afraid of acute and even deadly diseases, while those who are quarantined are also bored, lonely and extremely irritated.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the outbreak of the SARS virus, a number of mental diseases were reported, including chronic depression, acute anxiety, panic attacks, psychological agitation, psychological symptoms, delirium and even suicidal behaviour.
Compulsory contact tracking and quarantine, among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people's anxiety and guilt associated with infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this connection, psychological and mental care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to persons suspected and in contact with them, and to all other persons who require it.
Through psychological support, multi-pronged mental health teams should be set up, clear information should be provided with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-COV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the chain of transmission from animal vectors and infected people to sensitive hosts and are often used in addition to anti-virus therapy to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been done to develop S-protenin-based vaccines designed to produce long-lived and highly active antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Lively weakened SARS virus vaccines have been developed in animal research.
However, before the start of the trial, it is still necessary to determine the natural effects of these possible vaccines when they are used by older patients, the pattern of infection with deadly dosages and the degree of protection against infection with animal viruses.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported ever since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of diseases caused by the MERS virus are still emerging in the Middle East and spreading to other regions due to the conservation of animal sources in the habitats of the endemics.
In order to combat MERS, strategies have been developed for immunisation using the activated virus, DNA plasmaide, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles and elements of recombinant proteins, some of which have been evaluated by animals.
The development of a safe and effective anti-SARS-COV-2 vaccine for persons without immunity is an urgent and critical challenge that needs to be addressed in order to contain the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long time (on average 18 months) required for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic transformation of coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show a complete picture of the hospitalized current of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients have managed to heal gradually without complication.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also associated with the high frequency of complication and mortality among patients with severe disease.
Therefore, it is critical for health authorities to develop a preventative model of the disease in order to determine the priority of their actions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on the current data from the hospital studies, the following factors may affect the prediction of the disease in patients with COVID-19 or be associated with it (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the current of the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 affects mainly patients between 30 and 65 years of age, of whom 47.7 percent are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
Intensified patients were more likely to have a source of disease and complication and were much older than those who did not need it (average 66 years compared to 51 years), indicating that age is a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: infection of SARS-CoV-2 among men is higher than among women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Incidence and complication: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop acute myocardial and arrhythmic damage.
Cardiological events were also the main cause of death for patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also be associated with ACE2 positive cholera cells, which could cause liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely linked and can distort results.
Deviations found in laboratory studies: C-reactive protein in blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage and is suggested as a potential predictor of the current disease, reaction to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested that consideration should be given to the relationship between C-reactive protein, the severity of the disease and the projection of COVID-19.
In addition, higher levels of lactatedehydrogenase, aminotransphrase, alanin-aminotransferase and creatinzinase can predict the result.
These enzymes are produced in large amounts by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and they are released when the tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of cardiovascular or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: In order to predict results and difficulties in the treatment of COVID-19, in addition to other factors, consideration should be given to the results of the chest X-ray study and the development of the symptoms over time.
The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are sources of immunity commonly used in infectious diseases as complementary therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, many of the survivors have developed awascular osteonectorosis, which has caused lifetime disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if there is a need for steroids to treat patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be given in small dosages and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unexpected severe stress, as they often have to endure prolonged quarantine periods, cope with a high degree of uncertainty and witness the death of their relatives and other patients.
In order to ease the stress of such patients and help them resume their normal lives, psychological advice and long-term support must be provided.
According to the population studies carried out so far, the COVID-19 epidemic seems to be distinct from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in lower airways, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common cold diseases, can successfully reproduce in upper airways and cause weak symptoms or no symptoms at all at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients whose early stage of the disease or the incubation period has not yet ended may, through their normal lives, spread the virus on a large scale, making it very difficult to monitor the epidemic.
However, it was believed that the transmission of the SARS-CoV virus occurred when patients were seriously ill, although in most cases the infection did not occur at an early stage.
So today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it's harder to control.
China is currently engaged in a great deal of work that has declared universal quarantine in the city of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, and has extended the quarantine regime for almost the entire population, which has been introduced to break the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
While these measures have caused enormous damage to the economy and other areas of the country's life, the number of new patients being detected is decreasing, indicating a slower spread of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that by March the outbreak will be over, and the collapse phase will last three or four months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Hunter) and his colleagues estimated that the explosion of COVID-19, which looks much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from a group led by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) have developed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-COV-2 virus could affect two thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadian experts reported that the SARS-COV-2 virus had been detected in swabs from the nose and throat of patients who had recovered and released from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclic disease similar to the flu.
However, the decline in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, pointing out that policies currently in use may have had an effect.
Initial projections suggest that Ebola would affect up to a million people and cause half a million patients to die.
But through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually managed to take control.
It is likely that, like the SARS-COV virus, the infectious potential of the SARS-COV-2 virus can weaken, and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenous virus co-existing with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with those of SARS and MERS (Figure 55).
The SARS-COV-2 virus has a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus has also been detected in a cripple, which means that an oral-fecular mode of transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41% of the 138 cases examined may have been caused by infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 medical staff.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even outsiders, who contact patients or are infected.
The first line of defence for reducing the risk of infection is wearing face masks; and surgical masks and N95-class respirators (Serie No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgeon masks prevent micro-cells from spreading fluids from potentially infected people into the air and from settling on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) can protect against inhalation of viruses of 10 to 80 nm, they only miss 5% of the virus; SARS-COV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-COV, both of which are about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks folded together, health professionals in direct contact with patients must wear N95 masks (Serie No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health workers should wear a uniformed protective robe to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
viruses can also be absorbed through their eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2, even though he wore a mask of class N95; perhaps the virus hit his body through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health workers should also wear transparent face-screens or closed-type protective glasses.
It is strongly recommended that all populations in affected or potentially threatened regions should regularly wash their hands with disinfectant washing tools, try not to leave the house without self-insulation and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
A reasonable distance to a patient is a distance of about one metre.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus had not previously been known to humanity, the high degree of its resemblance to SARS-COV, reported on 7 January 2020, was to be a warning to China, given the experience it had gained during the 2003 SARS explosion.
However, it was only after 19 January 2020 that the Director of the Wuhan Center for the Control of Diseases calmed the population, reporting that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproduction from person to person and that preventing and controlling the spread of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement has significantly reduced social tension, especially during the period when the entire country was preparing for the celebration of the Chinese New Year, and a critical time has been missed when the disease could be contained within the city of Wuhan, with minimal losses.
China's health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, since each word is considered by citizens and may affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to contain a potential epidemic at an early stage rather than calm the public; and (4) conduct more focused and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly monitor and improve the public response system.
An explosion of COVID-19 caused by a previously unexplored coronavirus of severe acute type 2 respirator syndrome (SARS-COV-2) began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease had spread across China and, at the time of writing, had spread to 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV) coronavirus and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of acute acute respirator syndrome (SARS), COVID-19 erupted with a relapse of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are relevant to controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older persons more than young people and men more than women; the incidence and mortality rate of older persons is also higher than that of young people.
SARS mortality is higher than for COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
The patient with COVID-19 spreads the virus even when the disease is unsymptomized, while patients with SARS usually infect people only in severe cases, so it is harder to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-COV-2 is spreading much faster and larger than SARS-COV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal RNA samples for SARS-COV-2.
On the other hand, cured patients can again show positive samples for the virus.
All this significantly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
Against the background of such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, some critical issues remain to be resolved, as follows:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 percent Homologist between SARS-Cov-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, we still cannot claim that SARS-Cov-2 infection was caused by bats.
What kind of animal has become an intermediate species that has transferred the virus from the original owner, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the course of transmission, and the epidemiological situation can worsen at any moment.
Molecular simulations and biochemistry have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is connected to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus get introduced into the airway cells and cause further pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with ACE2-producing cells in other bodies?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically develop in the process of human-to-human transmission?
Will it cause a global epidemic, will it disappear just like SARS, or will it periodically recur like a flu?
These aspects are of primary importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
But we have no choice but to, whatever the cost, stop the epidemic as soon as possible and get back to normal.
Zoonous origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adjustment have stimulated the co-evolence of coronaviruses (Cov) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses (HCov) caused a slight disease, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respirator syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how devastating and life-threatening a human coronavirus can be.
The appearance of a severe acute type 2 respirator syndrome (SARS-COV-2) in Central China in late 2019 re-entered attention to the coronavirus and surprised us with the high transmission but less pronounced pathogen of the virus than the associated SARS-CoV virus.
A coronary human infection is a zoonosis, and an understanding of its zoonic origin will be very useful.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats for which they are not pathogens.
There are also known intermediate carriers of some human coronaviruses.
The definition of animal carriers directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Research on coronavirus animals can also shed light on coronavirus pathogens in humans.
In this survey, we provide available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on their history as well as their animal origin and modes of inter-species transmission.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic caused by the coronavirus found in 2019 (COVID-19) is also considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary to successfully change the hosts and the effect of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of cloaked viruses with one positive-polar RNA thread.
These viruses with the largest RNA-containing genome, containing between 26 and 32,000 nucleotides, have been named because of their form, which, when viewed under an electronic microscope, resembles the crown.
From a structural point of view, coronaviruses contain unselected genomes with the same organization.
About two thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) which are broadcast in polyprotenes of the app1a and the pp1ab relics.
These polyprotenes are later processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, which are nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open reading framework for structured proteins, including spike protein (S), silk protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprothein (N).
Other lines of coronaviruses have also encoded a series of linia-specific accessor proteins.
Based on the differences in the sequences of protein \ coronaviruses are divided into four types (alpha, beta, gamma and deltacoronaviruses), with betacoronaviruses containing most human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha- and beta-coronaviruses is bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and delta-coronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly overcome inter-species barriers, and some of them have developed to dangerous pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include human alphacorn viruses HCV-229E and HCV-NL63.
The remaining five beta-coronviruses include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, the coronavirus of severe acute respirator syndrome (SARS-COV), the coronavirus of the Middle East Respirator Syndrome (MERS-COV) and the coronavirus of severe acute respirator syndrome type II SARS-COV-2.
Human coronaviruses HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of slight form, such as cold and (or) diarree.
In contrast, SARS-COV, MERS-COV and recently discovered SARS-Cov-2 are extremely pathogenous, causing severe infectious diseases of lower breathing routes in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher risk of acute respiratory disease (ARS) and abnormal symptoms.
The first thread of the human coronavirus HCV-229E, B814 was extracted from a sample separated from a nose-sink of patients suffering from a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has generated more knowledge of HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) erupted, there was a generally accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was generally considered harmless.
The 2003 SARS flash was one of the most devastating epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were affected, and the overall mortality rate was about 10 percent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) had led to a long-lasting epidemic on the Arabian peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.
Found in 2019 a new human coronavirus (2019-nCov), which was later renamed SARS-COV-2, is the cause of the current coronavirus epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which, as of March 3, 2020, had killed more than 3 120 people and had more than 91,000 people.
The alarm signal has been received, and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-COV-2 Pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have zoonoid origins, and their sources are bats, mice, or pets.
Multiple data sets show that the evolutionary nature of all human coronaviruses comes from bats whose organisms are well-adapted and where they do not exhibit pathogens but show wide-ranging genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has left China and the world a severe challenge from a medical, scientific, social and moral point of view.
Studying the zoonic mechanism of the origin of human coronaviruses will help to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting inter-species transport.
It may also help or accelerate the search for an intermediate and amplifying SARS-COV-2 container, which is very important to prevent the recurrence of the disease in the future.
This overview provides an overview of the zoonic origin, inter-species transfer and pathogens of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we identify and consider the following common feature: the source viruses that have caused human coronaviruses are usually not pathogens for their reservoir carriers, but are pathogenous after inter-species transmission to the new host.
We also analyse the evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by reduced pathogens.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-COV-2 flash is also considered.
Animal blood viruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 HCV-229E virus was first extracted from a sample separated from a noso-sink of cold patients, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been detected in recent decades.
Table 1 illustrates the brief history of the detection of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCV-229E virus was extracted from samples taken from the breathing paths of patients with infectious upper breath routes in 1996; the virus was later adapted to the reproduction of the pulmonary cells in the WI-38.
HCV-229E patients experienced cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, general malaise and throat pain, while high temperature and cough were observed in 10-20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCV-OC43 virus was extracted from the organ culture and subsequent serial massage into the brain of the suckers' mice.
The clinical signs of HCV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCV-229E, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from other pathogens of the airborne pathogens, such as A-type flu viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both the HCV-229E virus and the HCV-OC43 virus are common in the world and are usually transmitted in winter at moderate latitudes.
Mostly the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by a disease of about two weeks.
According to a volunteer study, healthy people living with the HCV-229E virus have developed a common mild cold.
Only a few patients with weakened immunity have experienced severe infection of the lower airway.
The SARS flash, also known as the "typical pneumonia epidemic," was the first well-documented pandemic in human history to be caused by the human coronavirus, and the virus SARS-CoV, the third known human coronavirus, was the cause of the disease.
The first case of SARS was detected at the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread across countries and continents.
In addition to ultra-active distribution agents, it was estimated that each patient could infect about two more people; the incubation period ranged from 4 to 7 days, and the viral burden peaked at 10 days.
Infected patients with SARS-COV had initial pains in their muscles, headaches, high temperature, general maladies and colds, and among the more recent symptoms were breath, cough, and breathing problems.
Common laboratory deviations from the SARS standard are lymphopia, liver sample disturbances and elevated levels of creatinosis.
SARS patients have also experienced diffuse alveolar damage, epithelic cell proliferation and increased macrofag levels.
About 20–30% of patients then need intensive care and mechanical lung ventilation.
Other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and liver, can also be infected in such severe cases, in addition to the lower air tracts, usually accompanied by a cytokin storm, which may prove fatal, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
The virus was first extracted from an open biopsy of a patient's lung relative who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made to explore human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, HCV-NL63 was assigned to a seven-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first it was found that it mainly affects young children, older persons and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
For the disease caused by HCV-NL63, the symptoms are such as shrivelling, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolite.
Another independent study described the same virus from an 8-month-old boy in the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was found in the Netherlands, but in fact it is widespread.
It is estimated that HCV-NL63 is responsible for about 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases, and that the peak diseases they cause are at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCV-NL63 is associated with a obstructive laryngite, which is also called a croupe.
HCOV-HKU1 was released in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolite.
Besides out-of-patient pneumonia and bronchiolite, HCV-HKU1 is associated with an increase in asthmatic diseases.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E, and HCV-OC43, the HCV-HKU1 virus, which causes mild respiratory diseases, has been detected worldwide.
All four of the human coronaviruses, causing out-of-patient infections, have been well adapted to people, and their mutation, resulting in highly pathogenous diseases, is generally unlikely, although the incidents were and their causes are unknown, as in the rare example of the more virulent HCV-NL63 subtype, which has recently been reported to have caused serious infection of the lower airways in China.
Usually, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic by gaining the ability to effectively communicate and maintain themselves in humans.
The Coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV) was first released in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from a light 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure.
Most of the laboratory-confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia there were cases of import and distribution through occasional secondary cases of infection in close contact.
Another secondary explosion with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical effects of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) resemble the symptoms of acute acute respirator syndrome (SARS), both of which are marked by a growing acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by coronaviruses.
More than 30 per cent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and puking.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-supported cases of high mortality Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (34.4 per cent), MERS-CoV is considered one of the most deadly viruses known to humans.
Between mid-December 2019, Hubei Province of China found patients with pneumonia who are now, looking back, associated with infection caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CV-2) coronavirus.
The World Health Organization announced that the continued outbreak of low-level airborne infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 was a global public health emergency, and the disease itself became known as the Coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of about 3.4 per cent.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in Hubei Province of China is 4.2 per cent and that it is 1.2 per cent outside.
SARS-COV-2, like the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes a severe acute acute temperature, cough, and breath infection.
Some patients also experience diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly become acute breathing syndrome.
Despite the similarity of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2, given the high nucleotide sequence Homology (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-COV-2 appears to be less pathogenous, but has a greater potential for transmission than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
There are registered cases of unsymptomed infection of SARS-COV-2, indicating that the virus is likely to spread rapidly around the world.
By comparing and comparing SARS-COV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, important similarities and differences are found.
First, human-transmitted coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease they cause.
In this respect, SARS-COV-2 shows the same tendency as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-COV and the four human coronaviruses causing outpatient infections (i.e. HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection is similar to that found most frequently in human coronaviruses that cause outpatient infection, including non-specific symptoms, mild symptoms or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-COV infection, a small sub-group of serious cases of COVID-19 can be distinguished, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, the transfer of SARS-COV-2 also shows interesting patterns of both human coronaviruses causing out-of-patient infection and SARS-COV.
On the one hand, SARS-COV-2 transmission is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses that cause outpatient infection.
On the other hand, it has yet to be verified whether the transmission of SARS-COV-2 is decreasing with each subsequent virus (i.e. infection of each next person) as is the case with SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause out-of-patient infection, SARS-Cov-2 can be found in scala samples.
We still have to answer the question whether the felony-oral way of transferring SARS-COV-2 is as important (at least under some circumstances) as it is in the case of SARS-COV.
Of particular interest is the question of the possible seasoning of SARS-COV-2, which is typical of human coronaviruses that cause out-of-patient infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 explosion will depend on the characteristics of SARS-COV-2, including transmission, pathogen and sustainable distribution after a transition through people.
All four human coronaviruses, causing out-of-patient infections with mild symptoms, have been well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, perhaps these people have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be described as the only survivors of human coronaviruses in the past.
Human coronaviruses causing serious diseases in humans and people with human coronaviruses causing serious diseases have simply not survived.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses have to replication in the human body to the extent that there is an accumulation of adaptive mutations against the limitations of the host.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-COV-2 will last and the more people will be infected, the greater the chance that the virus is completely adaptable to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop its transfer among people through quarantine or other measures to control infectious diseases.
For many years, there have been four extra-hospital coronaviruses that cause common colds in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses don't need an animal reserve.
High-pathic coronaviruses SARS-COV and MERS-COV have not adapted to humans well enough, and their transmission among humans cannot be sustained.
They need to stay and reproduce in their zoonic tanks and look for cases of human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or augmenting media.
SARS-COV-2 has features such as SARS-COV/MERS-COV and four HCOV viruses.
It's very easily broadcast as a non-hospital HCOV, at least now.
But it's more pathogenous than HCV outpatients, and it's less pathogen than SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it adapts completely to human beings and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a container or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before we discuss the animal origin of HCV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, exacerbating and reservoir HCV virus vectors.
The animal is an evolutionary host of HCov if it carries a close-born ancestor with the same high homogeneity at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well-adapted and unpathetic in this medium.
In a similar way, the host reserve has been constantly transporting HCOV for a long time.
In both cases, the bearers are naturally infected and are the natural bearers of HCOV or its parent virus.
By contrast, if HCOV was merely placed in an intermediate medium just before or about the time it was carried to a person, it was not well adapted to the new host and was often pathogenous.
This intermediate medium can serve as a zoonoid source of human infection and act as a growing host, enabling the virus to replicate and then hand it over to people, increasing the incidence of human infection.
HCOV can survive a stagnant infection if it is unable to withstand a transfer inside an intermediate medium.
On the contrary, HCV viruses can also adapt to an intermediate medium and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir bearer.
Epidemiological data have shown from a historical point of view that a zero patient of SARS has been in contact with hunting and fishing animals (savage).
Further studies of seroprevalence have shown that animal traders have a higher incidence of IgG antibodies for the SARS-CoV virus than the population at large.
The Himalaya Cyvetes (Paguma larvata) and the animal-market raccoon dog became the first known carriers of viruses like and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was implicitly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all the ivory in the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayan cyves, living in nature or on farms and not on the market, had not been determined in most cases by SARS-CoV, which led to the conclusion that Himalayan cyves could serve only as an intermediate augmenting host rather than as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Significantly, since 80 percent of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies for SARS-CoV, it is not impossible to rule out the possibility that multiple species of small mammals can also be intermediate augmentors.
They all seem to be the deadliest bearers of the SARS-CoV virus.
The subsequent search for a natural animal carrying SARS-COV found a close-flying COV of bats, which was known as atypical pneumonia-enabled coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCov HKU3) and which is present in Chinese podcast bats.
These mice are positive for antibodies to SARS-COV and the genomic sequence SARSr-Rh-BatCOV HKU3.
These and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% of the same nucleotide sequence Homology as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats had become bearers of new human pathogens.
The bats also found several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-Cov), but none of them except one that stands for WIV1, cannot be isolated as a living virus.
SARS-COV is known to be a human angiotenzine converter enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1 from a sample of bats' fecals uses ACE2 bats, liquor and humans as a recipe for entering the cell.
It's curious that SARS serums could neutralize the WIV1.
Today, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the nucleotide sequence Homology.
Despite the high homogeneity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent of SARS-COV and that bats are not the direct reservoir bearer of SARS-COV.
The MERS-CoV is classified as the same group as the COV-HKU4 bats and the COV-HKU5 bats.
COV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same host, dialylpidase-4 (DPP4) for viruses.
The sequence of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase virus MERS-CoV is phylogeneticly closer to the sequences of betacoronviruses of bats detected in Europe and Africa.
So far, wild bats have not found a live MERS-COV virus.
The nucleotide sequence Homology of MERS-COV and its closest relative COV-HKU25 of bats matches only 87%.
So bats might not be the direct reservoir bearer of the MERS-COV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single row camels are sero-positive of antibodies specific to MERS-COV, as well as Middle Eastern camels in many African countries.
The living MERS-COV, identical to the virus found in humans, was separated from the numeric swabs of single-rib camels, further confirming the role of camels as true MERS-COV reservoir bearers.
It is also worth noting that camels experimented with MERS-COV had slight symptoms, but massive viral degradation.
Significantly, the infected camels produced the virus not only by respiratorial means, but also by fecal-oral means, which is also the main way to extract the virus from bats.
However, there are still questions, since many confirmed cases of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome did not have any prior contact with camels and are plausible in terms of human transmission or transmission by unknown channels, including unknown species that bear MERS-CoV.
The nucleotide nucleotides SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2 percent the same as the COV RATG13 of the Asian rhinophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-COV and MERS-COV, the divergence between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is too great to attribute parenthood to them.
So bats may not have been a direct reservoir bearer of SARS-CoV-2 unless in the future almost identical coronaviruses of bats are found.
Suspectedly, the direct animal carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species sold and killed on the Ugan bulk market for seafood, which was associated with many initial cases of COVID-19, which suggests a possible transfer from animal to animal.
Several recent studies based on metageneomic sequencing have concluded that a group of threatened small mammals known as the Pangolinas (Manis javanica) could also carry parent betacoronvirus associated with the SARS-CoV-2 strain.
The nucleotide nucleotide Homology of these new coronauvirus pangoline genomes matches SARS-COV-2 by 85-92%.
But they're also closely related to RaTG13, and the identity at the nucleotide sequence level is about 90%.
They are clustered into two layers of differentiation of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in a philogenetic tree, one of which has a phylogenetic dome (RSD) that is closer to SARS-CoV-2, with a 97.4 percent amino acid sequence.
Quite the contrary, SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 RSDs are more divisive, despite a higher degree of homogeneous sequences in the entire genome.
An earlier study of Pangolin patients also reported the definition of viral contiguity in lung samples, which were similarly related to SARS-COV-2.
This study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to produce a sequence of a genome that includes about 86.3 per cent of a fully-sized virus genome.
You can't rule out the possibility that pangoline has become one of the intermediate animal carriers of SARS-COV-2.
However, due to the diverging sequences between SARS-COV-2 and the beta-coronomy viruses of pangolines related to SARS-COV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-COV-2 from the pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-COV-2 and the beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-COV-2.
The evolutionary path SARS-COV-2 has not yet been set for bats, pangolines and other mammals.
While the highest sequence Homology was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-coronomy viruses of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 have the highest sequence Homology of the entire genome.
Very theoretically, a high degree of resemblance between the beta-coronviruses of pangolines associated with SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectiveness.
The opposite proposal favours a recombination between the beta-coron virus of pangolines, associated with SARS-COV-2, and RaTG13 in a third form of wild animals.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronviruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoonic origin of SARS-COV-2.
In addition to HCov viruses, the zoonic origins of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 viruses are also examined.
The phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E may come from coronaviruses of bats, while HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 parent viruses are found in rodents.
It was reported that a coronavirus of bats called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in a North American tricoloured sucker showed a close relationship with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCV-229E is genetically associated with another coronavirus of bats called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/1908, which was found in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate bearer might have been camels.
For clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis gave evidence of the events of the HCV inter-species transfer in anaemia.
When the HCV-OC43 virus was transmitted interspecies around 1890 and people were affected by animals, a pandemie of respirator infection was reported.
The history of the HCV-229E inter-species transfer is not so clear.
Alphacoron viruses of bats were found, similar to HCV-229E.
There's an alpaca alphacorn virus between them.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was people, not Alpacs, who could interact with bats in a common environmental low.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpacs.
Second, the alphacorn viruses of bats associated with HCV-229E have multiple and non-pathogenous bats, while the alpaca alphacoronvirus has caused an attack of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca alphacorn virus was not found in wild animals.
Thus, the probability that alpacs have received an alphacorn virus associated with HCV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogens, including rabies, Ebola virus, Nippah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it's not surprising that bats could directly pass HCV-229E to people.
On the other hand, while alphacorn viruses of bats could serve as the gene pool of the HCV-229E virus, alpacs and single-rib camels could become intermediate vectors that broadcast viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-COV virus.
MERS-COV provides a fine example of inter-species transmission from bats to single-rib camels and from single-rib camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known by its original identification and was then confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is evident that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of genes and interspecies.
Longevity, densely-populated colonies, close social interaction and flying ability make bats “the perfect spreaders.”
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to single-rib camels a decade ago.
It was well adapted to these camels, which from the intermediate medium turned into a stable and natural reservoir host.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very slight disease and has a relatively low rate of mutations.
His occasional handover to a man is an accident, and a man remains a dead end bearer of MERS-COV because his handout is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-COV, the role of pangolines, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-COV-2 virus is different.
In particular, the beta-colonial viruses of pangolines are highly pathological in the pangolines.
They can be dead-end bearers of beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-Cov-2, as well as squires in the case of SARS-COV.
In future studies, several possibilities for cross-species transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals to humans need to be confirmed or excluded.
First, bats can be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-COV-2, almost identical to SARS-COV-2.
People can divide the environment with bats by coalmining or cutting the animals' carcasses.
Second, pangolines can be one of the intermediate amplifiers in which SARS-CoV-2's related virus recently hit.
People are infected with the virus by carcass cutting and eating animal meat.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are vulnerable to SARS-COV-2.
The study of domestic and wild animals on antibodies is justified.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adjustment of SARS-COV-2 could have occurred in a third form, which had contact with both bats and pangolines.
The search for animal origin of SARS-COV-2 continues.
In addition to different types of animal carriers, the three main factors on the part of viruses have also contributed to the intersecting of inter-species barriers.
Above all, their relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the calculated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered to be “moderate-high” with an average frequency of between 10 and 4 replacements per year for one section 2 depending on the stage of adjusting the coronavirus to the new masters.
Coronaviruses have rectified exoribonuclease, the removal of which results in an extremely high rate of mutation and loss or even in vitality.
Interestingly, the Nucleotide analogue of Remdesiver suppresses the replication of coronaviruses by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
The Remdesire is one of the most promising tools against SARS-COV-2, which needs to be tested in the course of the trial.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than that of their hosts.
In addition, mutation frequency can often be even higher if coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-COV with high mutation frequency, the frequency of SARS-COV-2 mutations is likely to be lower, indicating a higher level of adjustment to humans.
Supposedly, this virus has already been adapted to another medium close to humans.
Besides SARS-COV-2, this also applies to MERS-COV, which is well adapted to single-armed camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that SARS-COV-2 vaccines and anti-virus drugs will quickly become ineffective as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses results in greater plasticity in genomic modification of mutations and recombination, thus increasing the probability of inter-species co-evolence, which is favourable to the emergence of new coronaviruses under conditions.
This is due to the many unique open frame of reading and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3 × end of the genome.
Third, thanks to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch the matrix during RNA replication.
During the transcryption of the DNA of the coronavirus in the medium, which serves as a mixing vessel, threads are often switched.
High-level and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43 and in animal coronaviruses such as SL-Cov and BatCoV-HKU9 bats.
Co-operation of the virus-carrier for transmission
In addition to the three virus factors listed above, another key factor for inter-species transfer is the interaction of the virus with the host.
This article provides a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection in inter-species transfers, of the SARS-CoV recombination.
Based on comparative analysis between SARS-CoV strains of humans and cyvetes, SARS-CoV is believed to be rapidly adapting to different media, especially with respect to mutations to RSD of protein S.
In general, the RSD of the squirrel S of the coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor, and the antibodies response of the host actively takes it away.
The SARS-CoV RSD is an amino acid, from 318 to 510, on a piece of S1, which connects to the angiotensin-preventive enzyme 2 (APF2) of humans and to its cohorts.
The SARS-CoV virus is capable of detecting APF2 recipes for different animals, including bats, civvies, mice, and raccoon dogs, enabling inter-species transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid remnants have been found in the RSD, which differ from human viral strains and cyvetes, of which 4 are in a recipe-binding motive to interact with the APF2 recipe.
SARS-COV has mutations from K479N and S487T in the RSD, which can increase the frequency of spine-like protein interaction with the human APF2 recipe.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can be particularly important for adapting the virus to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-COV-2 has the same cellular recipe as SARS-COV.
The difference of 30 percent between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in S1-segment squirrel S results in a possible change in the squirrel's affinity to human APF2.
Indeed, a study using a cryoelectron microscope suggests that this connection is 10 to 20 times more likely than between APF2 and S protein S of the SARS-CoV virus.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other sources were required for the transfer of SARS-COV-2.
It's amazing that HCV-NL63 also connects to APF2 but to another segment of the S protein.
There are many other HCov recipes, such as N aminopeptidesis for HCV-229E and 9-Ocetyl acid for HCV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for successfully adapting these coronaviruses to humans after inter-species transmission from animal carriers.
In addition to cellular recipients, the result of the HCV inter-species transfer is also controlled by other dependencies and limitations of the host.
Divergence between humans and natural HCovs reservoir carriers, such as bats, single rib camels and rodents, can be a barrier to inter-species transmission.
For successful inter-species transmission of HCV viruses, it is necessary to usurp the factors of addiction and to control the factors of restraction of hosts.
In this respect, molecular determinants in this important field of interaction between the virus and the host still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can result in an unbiased full-genomic detection of the dependencies and restrectives of carriers for SARS-COV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.
Generate new HCOV: back to zero
The variety of coronaviruses of bats creates a wide range of opportunities for new HCOVs.
In this sense, the coronaviruses of bats serve as a genetic pool for HCOV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also driving the evolution of HCOV and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein encoding genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV Access proteins, ORF8 is considered important for human adjustment, as the viruses of bats associated with SARS-CoV have been isolated, but have been found to encode orF8 elastic proteins.
In the strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nulet detachment was found that is typical of the SARS-CoV coronaviruses.
This division divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gamma-coronvirus lines where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been determined in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Localization of the recombination was also defined in non-structural nsp9 proteins, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
In a similar way, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV was affected by recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single row camels in Saudi Arabia.
Besides SARS-COV and MERS-COV, recombinant events have also occurred in other HCOVs, where HCOV was recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial breeding can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, which are likely to occur as a result of the removal of the virus from the supply of selective pressure, for example from the host's immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the HCV-229E prototype strain due to a double-nucleotide division.
While an interactive open frame of ORF4 can be observed in viruses of bats and camels associated with HCV-229E, the alpaca alphacoronavirus shows a single-nucleotide insert, resulting in a shift in the frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCV is also due to the pressure of selection on their reservoir media.
Infected by bats with coronaviruses, slight symptoms or lack of them were recorded, indicating that coronaviruses and bats were mutually adaptable.
It turns out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well-adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, failure to activate an inflammatory response in bats effectively reduces the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats has been suppressed by the a prejudicing of the inhibitor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of molecules of the main Class I complex.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen, which is provided by high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, simultaneously affecting the reading of exoribonucleosis, thus creating a selection pressure to generate strains of the virus which, when infiltrated by a new host, are highly pathological.
More pathogenous strains of the coronavirus may also develop as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or the properties of the protein to adapt to the host.
So it's no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last 20 years.
Coronaviruses are generic or cause slight symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They are replication confidently without causing a strong immune response from the host.
That is the secret to why we see unsympathetic hosts and what causes severe human infection.
The severe symptoms are mainly associated with the hyperactivity of the immune response and the cytokin storm, in which the more acute the immune response, the more severe the lung failure.
On the contrary, in unsymptomed hosts, the immune response does not involve the replication of the coronavirus.
The same immune response strategy can have positive effects in therapy against SARS-COV-2.
bats have a particularly strong interferon response.
So taking type I interferon at least in the initial phase of SARS-COV-2 infection should have a positive effect on people.
In addition, bats have lost their NLRP3-inflammasom activation.
On this basis, NLRP3-inflammasom inhibition with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-COV-2 follows a general pattern in which SARS-COV and MERS-COV emerged.
While the bat betacoronvirus, whose nucleotide Homology matches SARS-COV by 95%, was found, there is also a bat coronavirus, whose nucleotide Homology matches by 96% with SARS-COV-2.
Although it has been found that cyves and other animals in the markets carry viruses identical to SARS-COV, no directly intermediate media for SARS-COV-2 have been installed.
Pangolin betacoronviruses were found, astonishingly homogeneous SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the pangolines could be one of the intermediate hosts, or that fragments of the betacoronvirus genes of the pangolines could be included in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by humans.
Coronaviruses have attracted general attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 explosion.
A study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonic origin and HCOV animal reserves in human transfers.
Probable evidence showed that SARS-COV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 were derived from bats and handed over to the person through intermediate hosts.
If the SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between people and cyvets in the markets, closing the wild markets and destroying them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of various lines of beta-coronviruses, close to SARS-CoV-2, the Pangolines should be removed to prevent the zoonic transmission of infection from the food markets.
However, whether SARS-COV-2 is passed on to humans through pangolines and other mammals and how this can happen remains a challenge for future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in single-row camels.
These camels are an important vehicle as well as the main source of meat, milk, skin and wool for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for control of MERS, as was done in China's wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
In order to stop recurring MERS outbreaks, a complex approach is needed to develop an effective MERS-COV vaccine for camels, combined with other infectious controls.
Since we can't fix these viruses, there may be new genotypes that cause the disease to explode.
There are a wide range of animal coronaviruses around the world.
In particular, there are extremely different coronaviruses of bats with zoonic potential.
There is a great deal of potential for the evolution and recombination of these zoonoid coronaviruses, which in the future will result in new coronaviruses that are easier to transfer and (or) more deadly to humans.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, a culture of wild animals must be abandoned in some parts of China.
After severe testing of SARS, MERS and COVID-19 steels, a better readiness and a plan to respond to such situations is needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new areas can be seized.
While many of the properties of bats are favourable to the spread of viruses, it is possible to minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals.
For a better understanding of the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, there is a need for continuous epidemiological surveillance of mammals, which will be useful in preventing the transfer of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent a virus is to keep people away from the ecological layers of natural reservoirs of animal viruses.
SARS-COV-2 is still missing some fragments.
First, if bats have passed the ancestors' SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolines, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological void.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transfers, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate bearer, it needs to be seen how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-COV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it's a bat, a pangoline, or another mammal, it's expected that in the future SARS-COV-2 or its pre-viruses will be determined by their natural hosts.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-COV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for preventing and controlling COVID-19 in humans.
There is a need to update the diagnostic criteria for “discovery cases” and “confirmed cases” COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a short reference manual on diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCov), which provides an overview of our experience and valid recommendations to combat the epidemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
In that letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and set out the latest diagnostic criteria for “discovery cases” and “confirmed cases” in line with the “Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19” (the seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the PRC.
In December 2019 a new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) broke out, now officially known as coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus itself was called the "heavy acute respirator syndrome 2" (SARS-COV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemie.
In order to combat SARS-COV-2 infection, our team developed a short reference manual and published it on the Internet on the website of the journal Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This publication has attracted great attention.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been constantly updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven issues of the “Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19” published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were published, and some of its contents have changed considerably.
Recently, the work done by Zhou (Zhou) with the co-authors provided comments on our recommendations and made simple suggestions for diagnosis based on the already available clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as valuable background information on this global epidemic.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the "Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19" (probable seventh version) and on-going research, their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh issue of this document (dated March 3, 2020), in order to carry out a full analysis of the case of suspicion of a disease, one element of the characteristics of the epidemiological history must be combined with two symptoms of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movement or location in and around the city of Wuhan, where cases of COVID-19 were reported within 14 days before symptoms were detected; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-COV-2 (positive test based on nucleic acids); (3) history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and its surrounding areas or from other localities where cases of COVID-19 were reported during the last 14 days before symptoms were detected; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (> 2 cases of high temperature or respiratory symptoms registered for two weeks in small areas such as a home or apartment, office, school class etc.).
Clinical: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external occurrences of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white cells is normal or reduced, with reduced levels of lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
Diagnosis for confirmed cases should be based on suspicion of a disease with one of the following points of pathogen or serological evidence: (1) real-time PCR testing is positive for SARS-Cov-2; (2) full-genomic sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneity with respect to new coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-COV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or changing the negative to positive for SARS-COV-2 antibodies of IgG, or the increase in the letter type at least four times in the acute phase.
It may also be mentioned that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions of the document, a real-time PCR test was added for nucleic acids in the airway or blood samples.
Pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and the seventh issue added the need for serological evidence.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to find the best set for the rapid detection of nucleic acids, as well as for the analysis of samples extracted from the tracts, including the collection of blood samples, which improves the accessibility of various samples and helps to integrate positive results of tests for specific antibodies into the criteria for confirmation of the disease.
However, there is growing evidence of the need for care in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients with no symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented by Zhou (Zhou) etc. should be updated, since it classifies persons without a clinical symptom as a low-risk group.
The evaluation system also needs to be clarified in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we look forward to more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
With regard to diagnosis of “discovery cases” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations made in their countries.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the day-to-day maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new cases of death as a result of COVID-19 in a day.
This is the largest number of deaths from the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that 114 cases of infection were reported, as well as 33 cases of recovered patients at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In online surfing, Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora, Director of IEDCR, said that four men and one woman were the victims.
According to Dr. Myrjabi, two died over the age of 60, two between the ages of 51 and 60, and one between the ages of 41 and 50.
She also reported that two of the dead were from Ducky.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 Pandemic.
A member of the hospital informed the local news agency Anadole that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti- Corruptry Commission, who was being treated at the Maytri hospital in Kuwait.
On Saturday, on an online video, the Bangladesh Road and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader announced that public transport would be terminated for a longer period than originally planned until the next Saturday.
Public transport was stopped on 26 March and was scheduled to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods — medicine, fuel and food — was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March for two people who had returned from Italy, as well as for the wife of one of them.
As of 19 March, these three people had recovered.
SARS-COV-2 has crossed the millionth threshold of infection worldwide
According to the University of Johns Hopkins, the total number of cases of coronavirus infection worldwide was over 1 million on Thursday.
At least 52,000 people died from coronavirus COVID-19.
The rubble came on the same day that Malawi had confirmed the first case of infection and Zambia had recorded the first case of death from a coronavirus.
North Korea argued that it was one of the few countries on Thursday that had not been affected by coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours preceding 10:00 Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus infection were reported, of which at least 5 900 were fatal.
CBS News, referring to Johns Hopkins University data, reported more than 1,000 deaths due to coronavirus infection in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced increased measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the Moscow mayor, Sergei Sobian, extended the rule of self-isolation to citizens of the city until May 1.
President Vladimir Poetin had previously declared that Russians throughout the country, despite their isolation, would be paid until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of extending the state of emergency for 15 days; the result of the vote was 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one negative vote.
Saudi Arabia had extended the curfew in the holy towns of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while the previous curfew had lasted from only 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand was planning a curfew from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m.
The Ohio state governor, Mike Dewein, announced that the state's home isolation regime was extended by order until May 1.
Australian shops limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be bought at once
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian Woolworths and Coles networks reduced the number of packages of toilet paper that can be bought at once in all stores in the country, to two and one packages respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit.
These restrictions were reported in advertisements on the register as well as on the Facebook page.
Citizens are reported to have begun to make emergency stocks because of fears that COVID-19 might lead to a general isolation regime.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths network also limited the amount of toilet paper bought to one package.
Earlier, on 4 and 5 March, respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already restricted this number to 4 packages.
The Coles trade network, in a press release dated 8 March, reported that, with a limitation on four packages, “battle paper is still being bought in many shops very quickly, one delivery within an hour” and called such a demand “unprecedential,” while ALDI on a Tuesday post called this a “unexpected” tendency.
According to Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also restricted that number to two packages.
To fill the gap, Coles began ordering larger lots from the vendors and increasing the frequency of supply, Woolworths ordered additional lots, while ALDI made reserves for a special early sale on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, the Executive Director of the Australian Ritter Association, reported that the Ritters were attempting to restock, but this was made difficult by the restrictions placed on local authorities on the schedule for the carriage of goods.
It expected an increase in the cost of products, as providers were trying to meet demand, but less and less favourable offers were available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because of stock depletion, some shops were unable to share on Wednesdays.
In a report by News.com.au Dr. Gary Mortimer, a sales expert from the University of Technology of Queensland, said that shops were restocking every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper was a bulky product, so the stock stock stock was small and, after selling the entire product, long rows of shelves remained empty, exacerbating the feeling of a shortage of stocks.
"Coles and Woolworths believe that if the shelves could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these shelves in large amounts, the customers would probably not panic so much," says Russell Zimmerman.
In the last Wednesday, the manufacturer of processed toilet paper, Who Geves a Crap, reported the end of the stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, a toilet paper company called Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent, reported that they work 24 hours a day to provide enough goods.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when auctions in Melbourne declined due to the absence of customers during the week of the day of work, some real estate salesmen began to offer free toilet paper to the first bidders.
The Thursday issue of NT News, published in Darwin, included a tab of eight pages to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to the March 3 ABC Australia report, shops first reluctantly introduced restrictions on the quantity of goods to be bought, saying they were not planning to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, arm disinfectants, galantery, hand-washing and flour.
Along the same lines, in addition to events in Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the Ocado online store also restricted the sale of toilet paper to Andres with two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 Pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a COVID-19 infection epidemic caused by the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus.
While the term “pandemia” refers only to the extent of the disease and not to the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national governments need to take action:
“All countries together are still able to influence the progress of the Pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are to identify, test, treat, insulate, monitor cases of disease, and mobilise their citizens,” the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Theros Adenom Guebreius, explained.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming rate of spread and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemonium is “unprecedent.”
He said in an interview on CNN in February that “none other respirator virus except flu has yet to be traced from the moment it emerged to the continued global spread.”
Mr. Guebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before."
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak of this disease a public health emergency of international importance and then gave it a new status, the Pandemic.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauchi, said, "This is just the beginning, it's going to get worse."
According to Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported on Thursday, and more than 4,600 people died.
The Coronauvirus Pandemie of 2019-2020 is the present-day coronavirus pandemie of 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respirator syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
An explosion was detected in Uhan, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020 an emergency of international importance was declared in the area of public health, which was subsequently recognized by the Pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate in China is 4 per cent, while in the world it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing, and breathing difficulties.
Possible problems include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between the first symptom and the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or special treatment was found at present.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive; the recommended prevention measures include washing hands, covering mouths at cough, maintaining distances between people, detecting and securing self-insulation of people suspected of infection.
The authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk control and the closing of various sites.
The Pandemic has led to serious global social and economic consequences, the postponement or removal of sporting, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as a widespread shortage of goods, compounded by panic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 per cent of students worldwide.
The Internet has begun to spread misinformation about the virus, there have been cases of xenophobic and discrimination against Chinese, other East and South-East Asian citizens, or people resembling them, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where the spread of the virus is significant.
As a result of reduced travel and the shutdown of heavy industry facilities, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in the city of Wuhan (Hubay), China, reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Infectious cases were mostly associated with the Juanan seafood market, so the virus is believed to be of zoonous origin.
The virus that caused the disease is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that has a large resemblance to the coronaviruses of the bat, the coronavirus of the pangoline and the SARS-CoV. Later it was found that the very first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019 and that the infection did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the cases reported in December 2019 were related to this market.
On 13 March 2020, in a publication published by the South Chinese newspaper Morning Post, which was not verified, it was suggested that the very first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old inhabitant of Hubey on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the incidence of new infections in China had declined but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and that new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases in China itself.
The number of cases can be significantly understated, particularly because of the many cases with low symptoms.
By 26 February, there were relatively few cases of infection among young people, with patients aged 19 and younger accounting for less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide; Patrick Wallans, Chief Scientific Adviser of the United Kingdom, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until effective group immunity was established.
Statistics include cases of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test was positive according to official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country had been able to test more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, a formal policy had been adopted that required that testing should not take place with only slight symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that, by 23 January, 86 per cent of the cases of COVID-19 had not been detected in China and that such unregistered patients had become a source of infection for 79 per cent of the cases reported.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual cases in Italy was considerably higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the base reproductive number of infection (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for disease control and prevention suggests that this may be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are getting well.
In other, more difficult cases, the time between the beginning of symptoms and the moment of death ranged from 6 to 41 days, and the most common time is 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In China, about 80 per cent of deaths occurred in persons over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of deaths were associated with cardiovascular diseases and diabetic diseases. Official data on mortality from the COVID-19 epidemic usually include positive results of testing on COVID performed under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take into account those who have not been tested -- for example, in the event of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the epidemic exceeded official COVID by 4 to 5 times.
The Spokesman of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Control (CDC) admits: "We know that [the reported number of deaths] is lower than the actual number of deaths." His words are confirmed by reports of some isolated cases in the U.S.; this is often the case with incomplete data in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 Porc flu epidemic; the first confirmed death was recorded in Uhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China was recorded on 1 February in the Philippines and on 14 February in France outside Asia.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions across all continents, except Antarctica, had reported deaths, and several methods were commonly used to measure mortality.
All indicators vary depending on the region and the time of the spread of the disease; they are also affected by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes used, the time since the outbreak of the disease and the parameters of the population, such as age, sex and general health status. The mortality/prevalence rate is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within the specified time interval.
According to statistics from the University of Johns Hopkins, as of 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97.039/1.617 204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality-to-prevalence ratio has fallen from 17.3 per cent (for those with symptoms on 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the determination of the rate of mortality from disease (CFR) — the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from disease and the rate of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the values of certain population groups from the moment of infection to the end of the disease.
Some researchers have tried to calculate these figures for specific groups of people.
The University of Oxford Centre for Evidence estimates that the overall mortality rate from this epidemic is between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The top digit of this range is consistent with the results of the first arbitrary testing on COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with the statistical study on the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact duration of the flash cannot be determined and may vary depending on the location.
Matei Boni, a member of the University of Pennsylvania, states that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks usually occur on the plateau, and then when the number of available carriers ends, they begin to fade.
However, in the present situation it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen.
The Chinese Government's senior medical adviser, Jun Nanshan, claims that “everything can be over by June” if all countries are able to mobilise and implement WHO's recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine announced that SARS-COV-2 would "circumvent perhaps within a year or two."
According to a study carried out by the Imperial College under Neil Ferguson, “until the establishment of a vaccine (perhaps 18 months or more) will require physical remote measures and other measures.
William Shaffner, a student at the University of Vanderbilt, said, "I don't think that this coronavirus will ever disappear forever, because it is so easily transmitted," and that it may become "a seasoned disease that explodes every year."
The vibration of new explosions will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively unspecific, and some infected people may be affected without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are elevated temperature (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, wetness in the airway (silent), loss of smell, breath, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, cold, puking, bleeding, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO claims to be seriously affected by the development of breathing problems by about one in six people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Control (CDC) list acute symptoms such as acute breathing problems, constant pains or feelings of depression in the chest, sudden sense of consciousness confusion, difficulty in awakening and blueness of the face or lip. If these symptoms are present, you should immediately seek medical attention. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and death.
In some infected people, the disease may run unsymptomedly, without any medical symptoms, but the results of the tests confirm the infection, so doctors recommend that those who are in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed be placed under strict control and examined for infection.
Chinese researchers estimate that the number of cases of unsymptomous disease flows ranges from a few to 44% of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; usually it is five days. It is not clear what the symptom is: the initial estimate is that the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed this symptom was 30 percent, and then dropped to 15 percent.
Some details on how the disease spreads are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops released into the air with a cough, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Some studies indicate that drops can spread from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet) at open cough.
There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops released into the air during conversations that can stay in the air for a longer time, and that respirator drops can also be generated by exhalation, including during conversations, although the virus is usually not transported through air.
The drops may fall into the mouth or nose of nearby people as well as in the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (CLR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and hence to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person touches a polluted surface, including skin, and then touches his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also fears that the virus may be transmitted through fecals, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of a fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CV-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days after symptoms occur, although it may occur before symptoms occur or at later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where testing has been positive three days before the symptoms appear, and this suggests that the virus can be transmitted before the symptoms are shown.
There are only a few reports of laboratoryly confirmed cases of unsymptomous disease, but contact tracking studies in some countries have also found cases of transmission from non-symptomatic vectors.
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that it is not clear how easily the virus spreads, yet it is known that one patient usually infects two or three other people, and that the virus can survive on surfaces from hours to days.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304), the virus can live up to three days, on the cardboard surface within one day and on the copper surfaces within four hours.
These data, however, vary depending on the humidity and temperature, with positive results for domestic and other animals on COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus on to people, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, just as they do after contacting other surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.
The severe acute coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new virus detected for the first time by three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the nature of related coronaviruses, and outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed with domestic soap, which dissolves its protection. SARS-COV-2 has a large resemblance to the original SARS-COV virus.
It is assumed to be of zoonic origin.
A genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it is genetically clustered with a species of Betacoronavirus, a suburb of Sarbecovrus (cell line B) together with two other strains of bat viruses.
It is 96% identical to the other specimen of the bat's coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in the aminozysoids of certain parts of the sequence of pangoline viruses and human viruses.
The integer-genomic comparison to date has shown that the highest percentage of similarity (92%) is between the pangolin coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2, but it is not enough to prove that the pangolines are the intermediate users of the virus.
Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although it should ultimately be confirmed by analysis of the polymeraceous chain reaction with the reverse transcryption (RT-PRR) of an infected secret or computer CT scan.
A study comparing the methods of the PCR and the CT used in Uhan showed that the CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualisation functions are similar to other pneumonia and disease flows.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology University has published a recommendation that "no CT be used for scanning or as a first line testing method for COVID-19 diagnostics".
WHO published several RNA testing protocols on SARS-COV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
A real-time polymeric chain reaction test (RT-PRR) is being carried out.
It may be performed on breathing and blood samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
Usually a swab is used to perform the test, although a swab can also be used; a number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them had proved to be sufficiently precise to be approved for universal application.
In the U.S., the Celex serological test was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Typical symptoms of X-rays and computer tomography (CT) are asymmetric peripheral disturbances of the type of matt glass and lack of moulding.
An international database of confirmed cases of infection is being compiled by the Italian Radiological Society.
Due to similarities with other infections such as adenovyrus, images that are not supported by PCR tests have a limited clinical character when detecting COVID-19.
In China, a major study comparing chest CT results and PCR testing was carried out and it was found that, although the images are less specific in the case of infection, they can be decrypted faster; they are also more sensitive, and hence this diagnostic method can be considered as a tool for screening in the affected areas.
In order to diagnose the virus with X-rays and computer tomography, an artificially-enabled neural network was developed.
Strategies for preventing transmission include maintaining general personal health, washing of hands, avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, using coughing or sneezing napkins, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already be infected should wear a medical mask in public places.
In order to prevent transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that people be physically separated, and many governments recommend that they refrain from any urgent visits to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restrict the movement of citizens.
However, the virus has spread in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spread among the population, some members of whom do not know where or how they have been affected. It is recommended that health care providers who care for patients who may be affected should use standard precautions, as well as precautions when contacting other people and eye protection.
The use by governments of data on the location of citizens using their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, and organizations such as Amnesty International (Amnesty International) and more than 100 other organizations have made statements demanding that this kind of surveillance be restricted.
Various mobile applications have been developed and suggested for voluntary use; as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on solutions to ensure privacy of personal data, such as recording the user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user was in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test was positive, he will be notified. There are also baseless versions of how to prevent infection, such as brushing his nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
Currently, there are no COVID-19 vaccines, although many organizations are working on the development of COVID-19.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC (Centre for Disease Control and Control) also recommends that hands with soap and water be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after a toilet visit or severe hand pollution, as well as before food, after shrivelling, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because, outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which opens its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends that disinfectants be used to treat hands on a alcohol-based basis with at least 60% alcohol.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated by a number of solutions (on the surface of stainless steel the disinfectant begins to work a minute after application) with a content of between 62% and 71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2% to 7.5 % iodine.
Other components, such as benzalconium and gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in case of suspicion of or confirmation of COVID in an institution such as an office or a day-to-day facility, all such spaces, including rooms, toilets, public spaces, electronic equipment such as tablets, sensor screens, keyboards, remote controls and machines used by sick persons, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that, when coughing or sneezing, they cover their mouth and nose with their elbow or napkin and immediately discard used hygienic objects.
Those who may have been affected are encouraged to use medical masks, since the use of a mask may limit the volume and range of air-dissipated breath products when talking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "the use of a medical mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, and touching their faces with dirty hands is the primary way of infection." masks are also recommended for those who care for people who may be affected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who take care of a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of a mask actually reduces the number of personal contact.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of medical masks in public places.
CDC Centers, U.S.A., recommend wearing non-healthy tissue face masks. China has separately stressed the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact with other people (1 meters (3 feet) or less.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or public places.
Thai health officials encourage people to make face masks in their homes and to wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are not allowed to go outside without masks covering their noses and mouths.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered all visitors to the grocery store to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel has also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks were produced daily since mid-March, was ordered to use medical masks for all passengers on trains and coaches.
In Panama, citizens were obliged to wear a medical mask when they went outside; those who could not buy masks were recommended to sew them themselves in the home.
Medical masks are also widely used by the inhabitants of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is a measure to combat infection, which aims to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protective measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closing schools, jobs, stadiums, theatres and shopping centers.
People can use social distances by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowds, using unattended greetings and physically distance from others.
Many governments in the regions, particularly those affected by the explosion, now require or recommend social distance.
The maximum number of people who can meet in one place, as recommended by U.S. government and health organizations, has been rapidly reduced from 250 (in regions where data on the distribution of COVID-19 was not available) to 50 and then to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany refused to join groups that included more than two persons. Older persons and persons suffering from diseases such as Diabetes, Heart diseases, Respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of becoming seriously affected by the virus. CDCs recommend that they stay at home as long as possible if there is an epidemic in the region. In late March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the use of the term “sociological distance” with “physical distances”, thus specifying the purpose of this measure to reduce physical contact in social relationships, whether through virtual communication or through physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood to mean that people should be subjected to total social isolation rather than remain in contact with others in alternative ways; some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health which should be used during the Pandemic.
Among other things, it was recommended that you only have sexual intercourse with your permanent partners with whom you live, and in whom you are sure it has no virus and no symptoms.
People diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected are recommended for self-isolation in the home.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on proper self-insulation, and many governments have also made it mandatory or recommended that the entire population of affected areas be placed on their own quarantine.
Those in high-risk groups were ordered to have the strictest quarantine.
Those who may have been in contact with the affected COVID-19 or have recently visited a country or region significantly affected by the epidemic were recommended to be in quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Control strategies include controlling, suppressing or reducing the spread of the disease.
The control of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and is intended to track and insulate the infection, as well as other infectious control and immunisation measures to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a time when the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to reduce the impact: measures are being taken to slow the spread and reduce the impact of the epidemic on health and society.
Measures to contain and reduce the effects of the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
Controlling infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the base rate of infection to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the infection epidemic is intended to reduce the peak of the epidemic known as the equalisation of the epidemic.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading health services and allow more time for the development of vaccines and treatment methods.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help cope with the explosion include personal prevention measures such as hand-hygiene, use of medical masks and self-insulation; public measures designed to physically distance yourself, such as school closing and canceling mass events; community engagement to support and participate in such measures; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning; once the severity of the explosion has become apparent in China, more decisive actions have been taken to contain the explosion, such as isolation of entire towns and strict travel bans.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures to curb the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, massive scanning and localized quarantines were introduced, as well as a warning system for the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to infected people who were self-insulated and had fined those who had not done so.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks has increased and the accumulation of excess stocks of drugs has been fined, and the British and U.S. models have shown that there are serious problems with reducing (but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppressing ( stopping the epidemic).
Optimal policies to reduce the impact of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3 and mortality by half, but will still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Substance may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or as long as the vaccine is not developed, if sooner), because otherwise the spread of the disease will quickly resume when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic results in social and economic costs.
There are currently no anti-virus drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19, but efforts are under way to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking non-receptive cold drugs, drinking enough fluids, and rest can help to ease symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need Oxygen, I.V. fluids and respiration support.
The use of steroid drugs can only hurt.
Several compounds that had previously been approved for the treatment of other virus diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic means” could ease symptoms caused by SARS-COV-19.
WHO considers health capacity-building and adjustment for patients with COVID-19 to be the primary response to an outbreak of disease.
The European Centre for the Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for primary health-care clinics and services to assist in the redistribution of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services on testing on COVID-19, the abolishment of non-urgent procedures where possible, the detection of viruses and the isolation of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as the enhancement of intensive care capabilities by training staff and increasing the availability of HVF and beds.
There are different theories about where the very first case of infection could have occurred, the so-called "nine patient."
The first known case of new coronavirus infection probably occurred on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan Province of Hubey, China.
During the month, the number of cases of coronavirus infection in Hubey Province gradually increased.
They were mainly related to the Juanan seafood market, where animals were also sold, and one of the theories is that the virus was infiltrated by one of these animals; in other words, the virus is of zoonous origin. On 26 December, a case of a massive pneumonia disease of unknown origin was reported at the Hubei hospital, with which the doctor Zhang Tianjin worked, who reported the case to the Jianghan Center for Control and Control of the Infection of the Infectiousness of the city of Wuhan, on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at the central hospital in Wuhan warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenllian, were warned by the police of their responsibility for spreading false rumours, and the doctor, I-Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for raising panic.
Later, on 31 December, the Uhan City Health Commission published a public notification and informed WHO about the situation.
Uhan ' s health authorities reported cases of unknown pneumonia, which proved to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January, and the number of cases doubled at the early stages of the explosion about every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread in other Chinese provinces, thanks to Chinese New Years and the fact that Wuhan is the transport and main railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to more recent official data, by 20 January 2020, 617 people had already experienced symptoms of infection; as at 26 March, the United States had outpaced China and Italy for the largest number of confirmed cases worldwide; as at 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 had died and more than 364,000 had recovered.
About 200 countries and areas have recorded at least one reported infection.
Many European countries in the Schengen zone have restricted their freedom of movement and have established border controls due to the crisis.
The national response included measures to control the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as stay at home, shelter or isolation) and curfews. As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population of the United States, were in some form of quarantine, over 50 million were in isolation from the Philippines, about 59 million were in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion were in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later this figure rose to 2.6 billion, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Uhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, whose accuracy was not verified, the date was November 17.
On 26 December, Zhang Jisian's doctor was working on a case of a massive pneumonia of an unknown type, which was reported on 27 December by her hospital to the Jianghan Center for Control and Control of Incidence in the city of Wuhan.
The primary genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, showed the existence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Uhan City Health Commission issued a public notice.
WHO was notified the same day.
In response to such notifications, the police warned the doctors in Uhan of responsibility for the “distribution of rumours” of the explosion.
Originally, the National Health Commission of China argued that there was no “probable evidence” of the ability of a newly discovered virus to transfer from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, which was later called China's Communist Party's secretary-general, Xi Jingping, the "people's war."
Events of “the largest quarantine in human history” began to unfold, with the announcement of a health border on 23 January and a ban on entry to and from Wuhan, which later extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei Province and affected a total of about 57 million people.
In the city, the use of private transport was prohibited.
In many places, the celebrations of the Chinese New Year (25 January) were cancelled.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Jochenshan, which was completed within 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Lakešeni, was built, which received other incoming patients.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China has also reassigned 14 other institutions in Uhan, such as conference-centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including issuing health certificates for travellers and extending the period of celebration of the Chinese New Year.
Universities and schools were closed all over the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have put in place a remote working regime.
Travel restrictions have been introduced in the Province of Hubei and beyond.
The public transport schedule has been changed and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
Many cities have introduced a movement control regime, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have experienced some form of open air restrictions, and since the explosion took place in March, China has taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being imported from other countries.
For example, Beijing had introduced a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city; as of 23 March, only one case of internal transmission had been registered in mainland China, which had occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Katian reported that the spread of cases of internal transmission had been largely stopped and the explosion in China had been controlled.
On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubei except Uhan were lifted, which occurred two months after the shutdown of the Province into quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the entry of persons holding a visa or a residence permit would be suspended as of 28 March.
Those wishing to come to China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese Embassies or Consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese government called on companies and factories to resume their work and provided companies with monetary incentive packages. On 4 April, at 10 a.m., a national three-minute silence was held, opening a day of mourning for the victims of the Coronavirus, declared by the State Council of the country and coincided with the Quinmin holiday, but the central government requested citizens to pay tribute to the dead online, observing physical distance to avoid a relapse of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, largely because a large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji had gathered in Tegu.
The followers of Shincheonji came to Tegu from Uhan, which is believed to be the source of the flash.
As at 22 February, of the 9,336 members of the Church, 1,261 (about 13%) reported having symptoms. On 23 February 2020, South Korea declared its highest level of alarm.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, and as early as 29 February, the rate rose to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were placed in quarantine after three soldiers had been tested for a virus.
The flash has affected the number of flights, so the flight schedule of air companies has been changed; South Korea has launched a programme to screen the population for virus, monitor contacts and organize quarantine measures for contact persons, which is considered to be the largest and best organization in the world.
Screening methods included making it necessary to report their symptoms through a mobile application to all those who came from abroad, a major test for a virus which was ready the next day, and an increase in testing capabilities that allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea's programme is considered successful in fighting the disease, even though entire cities have not been isolated, and South Korea's society has initially been divided by President Moon Jae In's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either lauded the President's actions or called for Mr. Moon's impeachment for the Government's perceived inappropriate response to the disease.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea recorded the lowest total number of cases per day within four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as of 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed on a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, on April 1, South Korea requested help in testing for the virus in 121 countries.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-COV-2 infection in Kuma, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later the same day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the abolishment of concerts and other cultural and sports activities, Friday prayers, and the closing of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five billion rials to fight the virus.
President Hasan Rouhani announced on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the explosion, but that only individuals would be placed in quarantine.
In March, plans were announced to limit intercity travel, but the intensive movement between cities before the Persian New Year continued.
The Shia shrine in Kuma remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020, and Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.
Against the background of reports of concealment of the scale of the explosion in Iran, by 28 February more than 10 countries had associated cases with Iran, indicating that the extent of the outbreak there might be greater than the 388 cases registered by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was shut down and 23 of its 290 members were reported to have positive results on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called upon the Iranian prison authorities to release unreservedly human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent and to temporarily release all prisoners eligible for this category.
The organization states that there is an increased risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate health care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths within one day, the largest number of deaths registered in the country since the outbreak began.
By 17 March, at least 12 active or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By March 23, 50 new cases of coronavirus were reported every hour in Iran and one new death every 10 minutes from the coronavirus.
According to the WHO representative, the incidence rate in Iran may be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
It is also assumed that US sanctions against Iran can affect the country's financial ability to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights demanded that economic sanctions be eased against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease had hit Italy when two Chinese tourists had positive results in tests on SARS-COV-2 in Rome.
The number of cases of infection has increased rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare a state of emergency.
A non-associated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later discovered. It began with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardia on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law containing the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 of the 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed in quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "The entrance to and exit from the crisis zone will be blocked.
On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the shutdown of all schools and universities throughout the country, as there were already 100 deaths in Italy.
All major sporting events, including the A series soccer games, were scheduled to take place behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conté ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the shutdown of businesses except for supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIARTI) published recommendations on medical ethic with regard to protocols for the priority of medical care that patients might need to use.
On March 19, Italy overcame China's death rate from the coronavirus, ranking first in the world, after announcing 3,405 deaths.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, 15,887 cases of death and 21,815 cases of recovery, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardia region.
One CNN report notes that a combination of two factors can contribute to this high death rate in Italy: a large number of older citizens in the country and a lack of capacity to study all those who are currently suffering from coronavirus.
The United Kingdom had responded to the virus most peacefully in all affected countries, and by 18 March 2020 the British Government had not obliged citizens to observe any form of social distance or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government was criticized for not responding quickly enough and seriously to the danger faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement in which he recommended that no trips or social contacts of primary importance should be allowed, inviting people to work from their homes and to avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment institutions, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised the employed citizens to pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but not more than Pound2,500 per month as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more severe measures for social distances by preventing more than two persons from meeting and restricting travel and active rest in the air to cases of extreme need.
In contrast to previous measures, these restrictions were introduced with the use of police, fines and crowds.
Most businesses were ordered to shut down, except those that provide “life for the population” including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, business shops, fuel stations and garages.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Control, a leading U.S. government public health organization, announced that it had developed its own testing kit.
However, testing of the population in the United States had not been started immediately, and as a result the true scale of the disease had been concealed during that period.
Testing was difficult due to the marriage of the test kit issued by the Federal Government in February, the absence by the end of February of the authorization of the Federal Government to use non-State testing kit developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, as well as the limitation criteria before the beginning of March, which would allow citizens to be tested (this could only be done for the appointment of a doctor).
The Washington Post reported that by February 27, less than 4,000 tests had been carried out in the United States.
The Atlantic reported that by March 13, less than 14,000 tests had been carried out.
On 22 March, the Associated Press reported: "Many patients, even if they had symptoms and appointment of a doctor, were waiting for their turn to be examined for hours or days." After the first case of death from a coronavirus in the United States was reported on 29 February from Washington, D.C., governor J. Insley declared a state of emergency, which was soon announced by other states.
On March 3, a group of Epidemiologists from the Imperial College, London, informed the United States of the forecasts of the impact of the new Coronavirus on the country.
On the same day, President Trump signed a law on additional funding for the preparation and response to the Coronavirus, under which the federal authorities were provided with emergency assistance of US$ 8.3 billion to respond to an outbreak of disease.
The corporations introduced travel restrictions for staff members, cancelled the conference and encouraged staff to work from home.
The sporting events and seasons were cancelled. On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions to most of Europe, with the exception of the United Kingdom, for 30 days starting March 13.
The next day he extended the restrictions to include England and Ireland as well.
On 13 March, a state of emergency was declared by the President, enabling the use of federal means to deal with the crisis.
Since March 15, many companies have begun to shut down or shorten their working hours across the United States, helping to combat the spread of the virus.
By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia. On 23 March, it was reported that 10 700 cases had been reported in New York within 24 hours, which exceeds the total number of cases in South Korea.
On March 25, the governor said that social distance was probably an effective measure, as estimates of doubling cases dropped from 2.0 to 4.7 days.
As of 28 March, 32,308 cases were reported in New York and 672 died; on 26 March, more confirmed cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy; as of 8 April, 400,335 cases were confirmed in the United States, while 12,841 died.
According to media reports dated 30 March, President Trump decided to extend the period of social distance until 30 April.

In the state of New York on 3 April, the number of cases exceeded 100,000, and the White House was criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring information being made publicly available by the office of Vice President Mike Pence to monitor public statements and to publish health officials and researchers associated with the virus.
Generally speaking, President Trump's advocates had divided their views on how successful he was in dealing with the crisis.
Some officials and observers have criticized the US's addiction to importing critical materials, including basic goods, from China.
In mid-January 2020, the Travel Medicine magazine published an analysis of air travel schemes that was used to map and predict disease patterns.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the largest number of travellers from Uhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist routes in Bali, the disease was considered to be the least ready to explode, while Australian cities are considered the most prepared. Australia adopted its emergency plan for the new coronavirus (COVID-19) on 7 February.
In this connection, it is stated that much remains to be learned about COVID-19 and that Australia will pay particular attention to border control and communications in a threat situation.
On 21 March, a human biosafety emergency was declared in Australia.

On February 15, the United States announced that it would evaporate United States citizens on board a cruise ship called Diamond Princes.
On 21 February, a flight of 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Brilliant princess landed in Trenton, Ontario.
In early March, the Indian government began to extract its citizens from Iran. On March 14, a South African Airways aircraft chartered by the South African government flew with 112 South African citizens on board.
A medical check-up of passengers was carried out before the flight, and four South Africans who had found signs of coronavirus were left in China to reduce risk.
Only South Africans with negative tests on the coronavirus were evacuated.
The analysis was carried out by all South African citizens, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers participating in the humanitarian mission, and they remained under surveillance and quarantine for 14 days at The Ranch Resort.

On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency relief operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of infection.
WHO observed a clear difference between the situation of the wake-up of SAR in 2002 and 2004, during which the Chinese authorities were accused of seizing information, which allegedly prevented prevention and control of the spread of the disease, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central government “regulously provided updated information on the situation in order to avoid panic on the eve of the Chinese New Year”.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to ban movement in Uhan, the WHO representative, Goden Galea, said that, while “this measure was certainly not recommended by WHO,” it was also a “very important confirmation of the obligation to contain the epidemic in the most widespread place” and called it “unpredictable in the history of public health. On 30 January, after the confirmation of the ability to transfer infection from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of people affected in other countries, WHO declared a public health emergency of international importance (PHEIC), a situation which had been the sixth since 2009, when such a measure was first introduced during a pig flu epidemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tetros Adanom, said that the announcement of PHEIC was due to “the worldwide spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without sound health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tenros said that “there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily hinder international movement and trade” and that “the WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to provide $675 million in strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting the need for urgent assistance to those countries that “do not have systems to detect people affected by the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is the level of readiness for the epidemic of our weakest level” and called upon the international community to “make a choice whether to invest today or to pay for the future” at a press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, he said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide a "potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem."
As a result, a United Nations Crisis Management Team has been set up to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps will, as WHO states, “concentrate on health responses, while other agencies can use their experience to cope with a wider social and economic epidemic”.
On 14 February, WHO and China launched a joint ad hoc group, which provided international experts and WHO field staff in China to help address the situation within the country and to assess the “seriousness of the disease and its infection”, organized seminars and meetings with key national institutions, as well as field visits to assess the “effective responses at the level of provinces and districts, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for a possible Coronauvirus Pandemic, noting that “it is too early to call the disease a pandemic, but countries must nevertheless be prepared to do so”.
When the explosion broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the probability of global coronavirus spreading would be increased from a “high” to a “very high” — the highest level of readiness and risk.
Mike Ryan, the Executive Director of the WHO health emergency programme, warned in his statement, "This is testing every government on the planet to be ready for reality: it's time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared,” and stressed that the right response can help the world avoid a “worst scenario of events.”
Ryan also stated that current data did not justify the declaration of a global pandemic by public health officials, and added that the declaration of a global pandemic would mean that “we essentially recognize the fact that everyone on the planet will be at risk of infection with the virus”.
On March 11, WHO declared the coronavirus explosion a pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO said that WHO was “deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high incidence and severity of the disease and the equally disturbing level of inaction on the issue” and that WHO was seriously criticized for the perceived inappropriate approach to the concept of a pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
As a response to the current situation, Mr. Tetros Adanam, Director-General of WHO, was requested to resign, signed by 733,000 persons as at 6 April.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respect for everyone's rights during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
The Expert Group stated that everyone had the right to take lifesaving measures against him and that the Government was responsible for the organization of such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, and refugees and other unspecified groups in need of State support.
International government organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has created a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as feedback and advice.
The digital hub provides information on the policy measures of various countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions in order to help countries learn from each other and contribute to a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gove and Edward Bolsonro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonro, for their efforts to combat the epidemic, which began with the Province of Hubey in China.
A number of leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) level were dismissed for the quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and these dismissals showed dissatisfaction with the political upheaval in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect the secretary-general of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jingping, from the public's anger over the coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that a coronavirus erupted in Uhan, but took a side to the concept of conspirator, according to which COVID-19 had occurred in the US or Italy.
The U.S. government called the Coronavirus the "China virus" or the "Uhan virus," saying that "censorship in China only worsens the situation with the virus, which has now become a global pandemic," and this has in turn been criticized by some commentators, who claim that such an approach is racist and "distracts from the failure of the U.S. President's administration to control the spread of the disease."
The Daily Beast had access to a U.S. government cable containing a communications strategic trick, apparently invented by the National Security Council, and there were references to the strategy: "It's all in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conference and television performances. "Or organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to help countries suffering from the virus are part of a “propaganda drive” to gain global influence.
The head of the EU foreign policy department, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a “geopolitic component that includes a struggle for influence through a PR and so-called policy of generousness.
Borrell also stated that "China has persistently promoted its role as a responsible and trusted partner, unlike the US."
China has also called upon the US to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and some have reported that it has sent assistance to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was prohibited because of the US sanctions of April 3.
The US authorities are also accused of redirecting aid intended for other countries to their own country.
Other countries such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Czech Republic and Italy also had a dispute over medical masks.
In addition, Turkey has allocated hundreds of SVLs to Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of support for the coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's EU ambassador, said that “only China has responded in a two-way manner.
This is certainly not a sign of European solidarity.
On 22 March, following a telephone conversation with the Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conté, Russian President Vladimir Poetin arranged for Russian military nurses, specialized disinfectant transport and other medical equipment to be sent to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “high-level political source” saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was “unprofitable or of little use to Italy.
The source accused Russia of trying to make a positive impression on the global public at the “geopolitic and diplomatic” level.
President Attillo Fontana of Lombardy and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Mayo, rejected the media attacks and thanked them for their help.
Russia also shipped a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
The Spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Pescove, said that "by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that, when American medical equipment and materials grow faster, they will also be able to respond if necessary."
The NATO Defence 2020 military exercises planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest post-cold-war military exercises, will be carried out in a short format.
The secretary-general of the campaign for nuclear disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 (Protector 2020) exercise: "In the current public health crisis, these exercises threaten not only the lives of the US military and many European member countries, but also the inhabitants of countries where such activities are to be carried out." The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus. Infected by about two dozen members of Parliament, as well as 15 other current or former politicians.
On 14 March 2020, Iran's President, Hasan Rouhani, in an open letter, asked world leaders for help, reporting that his country was experiencing difficulties in fighting the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets due to the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic had led to calls for the United States to adopt a social policy that had spread in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a single system of health care and childcare, paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Polytologists expected that this might have a negative impact on the chances of Donald Trump being re-elected in the 2020 Presidential elections, and the crisis had made the diplomatic relationship between Japan and South Korea worse.
South Korea criticized Japan's “undefined and passive quarantine measures” after Japan announced that any citizen coming from South Korea would be placed on a two-week quarantine in government-specific locations.
South Korean society was first divided by President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either lauded the President's actions or called for Mr. Moon's impeachment for the Government's perceived mismanagement of the disease, and the Pandemic forced countries to adopt emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this step would enable governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Victor Orban the indefinite power to run by decrees, suspend the functioning of Parliament, and hold elections and punish those accused of spreading fake information on the virus and on government responses to the crisis.
The coronavirus explosion was cited as the cause of several supply gaps due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of goods in a panic situation and the breakdown of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Medicines Administration issued warnings of a shortage of drugs and medical equipment due to increased demand for food and supply.
There were also panic purchases in several localities, resulting in the loss of basic goods, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which in turn led to a shortage of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tetros Adanam, the demand for personal protection has increased 100fold.
This leap has led to a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the usual price, as well as a four to six-month delay in the supply of medical supplies.
It had also caused a shortage of personal protection tools worldwide, and WHO had warned that health workers would therefore be at risk.
In Australia, due to the Pandemic, Daigo customers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
These activities have led to a shortage of children's food in some supermarkets and have been subsequently prohibited by the Australian Government; despite the high incidence of COVID-19 in North Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food, acute food insecurity has been averted in both areas.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation and illegal trade of critically important products, which have been successful, have prevented the acute food shortage expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, whose farming production is small, has not experienced a significant decline, but the industry believes that prices for farming can rise.
The shelf of food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork stocks to ensure that the population was well fed.
Similar laws require food producers to save their food supplies in case of emergency, as well, in Italy.
The damage to the world economy had affected China: according to media reports of 16 March, China's economy had been severely affected in the first two months of 2020 by government measures to combat the spread of the virus, which had reduced retail sales by 20.5 per cent.
Mainland China is a large economic and productive centre; therefore, it is believed that a virus explosion is a serious and disruptive threat to the world economy.
According to projections by Agatha Demari, a member of the Economics Intelligence Unit, market stability will continue until there is a clearer picture of potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic on global growth could exceed the effects of the 2002–2004 SAR epidemic.
One of the estimates made by an expert from the University of Washington in St. Louis is that the damage to the world supply chain can exceed $300 billion, and negative impacts can last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of the oil-exporting countries (OPEC) has begun to take “emergency measures” after a sharp fall in oil prices due to a fall in demand from China.
On February 24, world stock markets collapsed because of a significant increase in the number of people affected by COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, because of growing fears about the coronavirus explosion, various US stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones index for industrial companies, have shown the sharpest fall since 2008, with the Dow index falling by 1,191 points, the largest one-day fall since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed a more than 10 percent drop.
On February 28, Scopy Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
The stock fell again because of fears about the spread of the coronavirus, and the largest collapse occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is a possibility of an economic crisis.
The economist, Mohamed El-Erian, commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks react faster than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to bans on movement, the closing of public places, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of governments not to make any visits.
As a result of all these measures, numerous air companies cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in the demand for airfares, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British Flybe Regional Airlines ceased to exist.
The negative influence on the cruise industry has turned out to be as strong as ever.
Several railway stations and ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year's celebrations.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of activities involving a large number of people, including the annual New Year's Festivals; private companies have also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands.
Many of the New Year's events had been cancelled and tourist attractions had been closed in order to prevent massive crowds of people; for example, Beijing had closed the Forbidden City and abolished traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and districts of China, the authorities extended the New Year's Vacation until 10 February, instructing most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of its exports.
The Hong Kong authorities have increased their response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared an emergency, closing schools by March and canceling New Year's celebrations, and the retail sector has suffered globally: shop hours have been shortened and some stores have been temporarily closed.
Visits to retail places in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
North America and Middle East retailers have cut sales by 50-60%.
As a result, in March, the attendance of shopping centers dropped by 33-43 per cent compared to February.
Trade centre operators around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved health conditions, installation of temperature testing equipment for visitors and cancelling activities. The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that the Latin American crisis caused by the Pandemic may leave 14 to 22 million more people out of poverty than would have been in a similar situation but without a Pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Uhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers found themselves at home in their own country or locked up in Hubey Province; in March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
According to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, in the United States, a coronavirus explosion can rob 47 million people of jobs, while the rate of unemployment may rise to 32 per cent. Self-isolation measures introduced in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers unemployed on daily pay. A study carried out by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44 per cent of Canadian households were in some way unemployed; nearly 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost their jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for a temporary unemployment allowance, while 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit, and nearly half a million companies in Germany moved their employees to government-subsidized reduced working hours, part-time.
The German part-time payment scheme was also introduced in France and the United Kingdom.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.
The organizations of culture and art have tried to support their (often State-funded) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society by providing security for their employees and the public and, if possible, by supporting the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been shut down for an indefinite period or restricted to various degrees, and exhibitions, events and presentations had been cancelled or rescheduled.
In return, extensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and another recent and growing consequence of the spread of the virus is the abolishment of religious services, major sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology and fashion shows.
The film industry has also crashed, and the Vatican has announced the cancelling of the Good Week in Rome, which is being held during the last week of the Christian repentant period, the Great Post.
Many diocese encourage older Christians to stay at home and not attend Sunday services; in some churches church services have begun broadcasting on radio, live or television, while some church leaders have offered to perform public worship.
The Roman Catholic diocese of Rome closed down its churches, chapels and St. Peter's Square, where Christian pilgrims are no longer appearing, and later other religious organizations have also cancelled worship and restricted access to public worship in churches, shrines, synagogues, temples and gourrows.
The Iranian Ministry of Health had announced the lifting of Friday prayers in areas affected by the coronavirus explosion and the closing of the shrines; Saudi Arabia had prohibited foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants from entering the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The Pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports events since the Second World War.
Most of the major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA League of Champions 2019-20, the premier League 2019-20, the Euro-2020 UEFA, the NBA 2019-20 season and the NHL 2019-20 season.
The splash of the coronavirus also destroyed the plans for the 2020 Winter Games, which were due to begin in late July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be "post 2020 but no later than the summer of 2021". Casinos and other games around the world were closed, and poker tournaments, which were usually broadcast live, were either moved or cancelled.
This has led many players to go online and many gaming sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, and the entertainment industry has also suffered because various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theatres, such as Broadway theatres, have also cancelled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for the continuation and sharing of their activities on the Internet, for direct online concerts or web festivals; this helps people in creative professions to continue to perform, produce or publish their works.
There's a lot of online memories on the subject of the coronavirus, many of which are humorous and smoothing down the anxiety of the periods of uncertainty.
Since the advent of COVID-19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobic and racist attitudes towards Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as against people from hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
There have been instances of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
Information for February (when most cases of infection were still confined to China) showed racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received fair retribution for anything.
Some countries in Africa are also experiencing an increase in anti-Chinese sentiments.
Many inhabitants of Uhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to Chinese citizens, as well as to those living in virus-stricken areas, both offline and online.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, particularly in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious explosion of COVID-19; as a result, citizens of such regions may also begin to be affected by suspicion and xenophobic attitudes, and citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed an early petition urging that Chinese citizens be prevented from entering their countries in order to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComToJapan (#China Do Not Come Japan) took a leading position on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, reported a growing level of racism and even attacks.
US President Donald Trump faced criticism for calling the coronavirus "the Chinese virus"; critics think it's racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign citizens from Uhan to the New Sanjara.
Pupils from North-East India bordering China and studying in large cities of India reported cases of harassment related to a coronavirus explosion.
Dileep Ghosh, President of the State branch of Bhoratiya Janata's party, West Bengal, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “so God had avenged them.”
Later, these remarks were condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, which called them “disgusting” and again broke out in China because of the Pandemic, xenophobic and racist attitudes towards non-Chinans: aliens became known as “foreign garbage” and objects to be “removed”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made available their scientific articles on the explosion of the coronavirus.
Some scientists have decided to provide short-term access to their research results on printers' publications servers, such as bioRxiv.

The trafficking of wild animals and diseases from animal to animal is a health risk associated with the trade in exotic animals.
Laboratory testing of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-COV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the presence of the virus and methods for detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the OT-PRR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is intended to detect only RNAs of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.
Antibodies detection (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for popular control.
Tests on antibodies reveal the number of people who have suffered from the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to be treated by the hospital or were not available at all.
The exact rate of death due to this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capabilities, no country had reliable data on the incidence of the virus among the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and information on the number of tests carried out in different countries was very contradictory.
Such differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality, which may be significantly exaggerated in some countries.
By means of a polymeraceous chain reaction to real-time inverse transcryption (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on samples from breathing routes obtained in various ways, including a swab or sample of wet.
The results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
The OT-PCR test carried out on swabs taken from the throat is valid only during the first week of the disease.
The virus may later disappear from its throat, but it continues to reproduce in its lungs.
Infected patients tested for the second week of the disease may alternatively extract material from the lower airway using a suction catheter or use refreshments (microte).
An early PCR test was developed at the Sharite hospital, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time polymeric chain reaction with a real-time inverse transcryption (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis for 250,000 sets, which were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a kit for detecting SARS-Cov-2 based on the PCR at the hospital level (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
It detects the "E" gene common to all beta-coronaviruses, and the "RdRp" gen specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group was one of the first companies to be authorized by the National Medical Administration of China to use the emergency detection kit SARS-COV-2 based on the PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributed through the International Regent Resource for real-time RTCPs (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from older versions of the test set produced incomplete results due to missing reagents and a narrow area of testing CDCs in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020 and only after that date were State and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
Testing was approved by the Food and Medicines Authority as part of an emergency application authorization, and US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced that it was possible to test for COVID-19 infection using RT-PRCs across the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing on COVID-19 nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been declared; analysis must be collected and processed according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was designed and carried out by the State Centre for Research and Research in Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Public Health Service; it was reported that on March 12, 2020, the Mayo hospital developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the approval of the FDA to use a test that can be performed within 3.5 hours on a large sample volume, enabling one machine to process about 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency application authorization (UA) to the Abbott laboratory for testing the Abbott m2000 system; previously the FDA issued a similar permission to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cephead also received the EUA from the FDA for a test of about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test using amplification technology for insulated nucleic acids instead of the PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of successive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests a day, and Taiwan is currently developing a test using monoclonic antibodies, which is uniquely linked to the nucleo-capsid protein (N-squirrel) of the new coronauvirus, and hopes to be able to produce results in 15 to 20 minutes, like a flu express test.
A March 2020 study of specialized literature concluded that “bread cell rentgenograms have a small diagnostic value at an early stage, while the results of CT [computer tomography] may be of such value even before symptoms occur”.
Typical CT features include two-way multi-pillar sub-plural compaction tricks of the type of "match glass" with peripheral, asymmetrical and a posterior distribution.
Sub-plural dominantity, the symptom of a rocky bridge, and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Uhan at the time of the current Pandemic showed that the CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, though less specific, as many of its visualisation functions are similar to other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College has issued a recommendation that "no CT be used for scanning or as a first line test method for COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC method is recommended for initial CDC scanning.
Part of the immune response to infection is to produce antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and to carry out popular controls. The analysis can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or by in situ diagnosis (PoCT)
In many clinics, these tests will be able to perform high-quality automated systems, but their accessibility will depend on the speed of production of each system.
CLT usually uses one sample of peripheral blood, although serial samples may be used to track the immune response.
At PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by piercing each cover.
Unlike PCR methods, blood collection is not required for testing. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have completed all the necessary registration procedures and can now extend their tests to antibodies.
As of 7 April 2020, the FDA had approved only one emergency application test. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics had obtained European permits to use their test sets, which can detect IgG and IGA antibodies in blood samples that have the ability to control the virus.
Test productivity is several hundred samples over a few hours, and therefore this method works much faster than the usual viral RNA PCR analysis.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection. In early April, Britain found that none of the antibodies analysis tools it had acquired yielded satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to enable patients suspected of having a virus to stay at home: “the emergency services provide the patient with a sample sample tube,” the patient spits it back into it, and after some time gets the results of the test. The British NHS has announced the launch of a pilot scheme to test suspicious cases in the home, which removes the risk of infection by the patient of other hospital visitors, or the need to disinfect the emergency car if it is used for transporting the patient; during an emergency test on COVID-19, a medical officer takes an analysis using all appropriate precautions.
On 2 March, in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Medical Insurance stated that it was ready to run about 12,000 tests a day under outpatient conditions, and a week earlier it was only able to do 10 700 tests a week.
If a doctor is responsible for the examination, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the President of the Institute, Robert Koch, Germany's overall testing productivity is 160,000 tests a week.
As of 19 March, it had been suggested that a rapid test be carried out in several large cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that at least 483,295 tests were taken on calendar week 12/220 on SARS-CoV-2, up to and including the week 12/220 and 33,491 (6.9 per cent) of the results were positive. Researchers at the Israeli Technical and Rambam Hospital clinics have developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further tests only if the combined sample proves to be positive. In Uhan on 5 February 2020, BGI opened a temporary laboratory of 2,000 square meters on the detection of emergency cases called "Huo-Yang" (in Chinese or "Fire Eye"), which could handle more than 10,000 samples a day.
The construction of the laboratory was arranged by the BGI founder Van Jiang and completed within five days; the simulation showed that if the laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated rate, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would have been 47% higher, and therefore the cost of the quarantine would also have been twice as high.
Following the opening of the Huo-Yang laboratory in Uhan, the Huo-Yang laboratories were immediately opened in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
By 4 March 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day, and open multiplex Origami Assays schemes were published, which can test up to 1,122 patient tests on COVID19 using only 93 tests. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, excluding the use of robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, owing to a shortage of reagents, mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States had become a challenge.
As a result, some authors have requested test sample processing protocols, which provide for the burning of samples at 98°C (208°F) within 5 minutes in order to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the amount of testing for the coronavirus currently being carried out by the United Arab Emirates per capita exceeds that of any other country, and that a large part of the population will soon be tested.
This was due to the rapid testing capabilities, along with the purchase of a mass testing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yang emergency detection laboratories in China).
This laboratory, which has been installed in 14 days, is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RTCP tests a day and is the world's first laboratory of such a large scale operating outside China.
Various testing options for different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of testing packages, which are sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own sets.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Sanitary and Epidemiology Centers was not available until 28 January, resulting in a lack of test sets in the U.S.; at the very beginning of the explosion in China and the U.S., there were problems with the robustness of test sets, and those countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient sets recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts say that the wide accessibility of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean government has been working to provide testing facilities, mostly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the scaling up of testing programs as the best way to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. As a result of the increased demand for testing due to the rapid spread of the virus, many of the United States private laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of samples of testing, were overloaded and the stocks of swab and chemical reagents were rapidly exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kit.
The U.S. CDC test packages had “disadvantages” and therefore the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing, and Spain acquired test packages from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co. Ltd, but found that the results of these tests were incorrect.
The firm explained that the reason for the inaccuracy of the results might be the failure to collect samples or the misuse of the set.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw the incorrect results and replace them with other sets, the Shenchen Bioeasy. 80 per cent of the tests that the Czech Republic had acquired in China had yielded incorrect results. The 1.2 million test packages acquired by Slovakia in China were also found to be incorrect.
Atesh Kara, a member of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, said that the test pieces acquired in China had "high errors" and the Ministry had "not begun to use them." The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test sets in China, but in early April 2020 it was declared unfit for use.
Quantitative measures for those whose tests had yielded positive results on SARS-COV-2, as well as surveillance of those who had been contacted by such patients, had had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaud, where for the first time a person died of COVID-19 in Italy, carried out two rounds of testing for the total population of about 3,400 at intervals of about 10 days.
About half of those with positive results had no symptoms and all patients with confirmed cases had been placed on quarantine.
The entrance to the locality had been closed, and the measure had completely stopped the spread of the infection.
With extensive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 Coronauvirus Pandemic in Singapore was much less tense than in other developed countries, and extreme restrictions such as forced closing of restaurants and shops had not to be introduced.
Many of the events there were cancelled, and on 28 March Singapore began urging the inhabitants to stay at home, but schools ending on 23 March opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also coped with the epidemic through intensive contact monitoring, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions have been less aggressive.
A statistical study found that in countries where more tests have been carried out than deaths, mortality rates are much lower, probably because they have been able to detect more patients with low or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative results to COVID-19 in one of the 16 WHO testing laboratories for validation testing.
Of these 16 control laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 is in North America and 1 is in Australia.
On the next graph, the column's values for `positive results' depend on a country-specific testing policy.
A country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher rate of success than a country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of symptoms of the virus, under other conditions.
The washing of hands, also known as the hand hygienic, is a process of cleaning hands to remove pollution, fat, microorganisms or other dangerous substances.
Regular washing of hands with soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted in a fecal-oral way.
A person may also be affected by respiratory diseases such as flu or common cold, for example, if he touches his eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day after which hands should be washed with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the sick person's care.
After changing diapers or washing a child to the toilet.
After sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
After contact with animals, feeds or waste of animal origin.
Hand health concerns health care related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking drugs or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The primary medical goal of washing is to clear hands from pathogens (bacteries, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing diseases) and from chemicals that may prove to be dangerous or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who cook or work in the health sector, but it is also important for all others.
Hand washing is very healthy: for example, it minimizes the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarree, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces the rate of infant mortality at home.
A study in 2013 found that better hand washing could result in a slight acceleration of the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by taking advantage of simple habits such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure has the potential to reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders of the use of hand washing can reduce the number of cases of diarrhea by about a third, and this is compatible with the use of low-income clean water.
Reducing the number of cases of diarrhea by 48% may involve washing hands with soap. washing hands with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (PRSs), provided that appropriate habits are developed in every home, in schools and in other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, a major complication of the RSI, is the main cause of death among children under five years of age, which kills about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia in general kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that washing hands with soap before food and after toilets, which have become a solid habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce mortality from diarrhea by almost half, and death from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other health services carried out under water, sanitation and health (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also prevents impetigo, a disease that is transmitted directly through physical contact.
A slight negative effect of frequent washing of hands is that it can cause drying of skin and, consequently, damage of skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that too often washing of hands can lead to soot and skin swelling – a disease known as eczema or dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too often washing hands can also be considered a symptom of obsession-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (feature, defecation), after washing the baby's buttocks (change of diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases in which hands should be washed to prevent transmission of the disease: before or after processing the cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or shrivelling, after touching the animal's waste or after contacting the garbage.
In many countries, the washing of hands with soap is rather rare.
A 2015 study on hand-washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7 per cent of families have had their hands washed with soap as a common practice. A 2014 study found that the highest rate, 97 per cent, was found in Saudi Arabia; the US on this list is nearer to the middle, 77 per cent; the lowest rate is found in China at 23 per cent. Currently, there are several methods of changing behaviour and creating a habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group hands washing by school children at the scheduled time of the day is one of those methods that helps to train children to do so.
The “Emergency Care Program” implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of large-scale efforts to improve child health and education.
The national programme is based on deworming, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily soap and fluoride brushing.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of micro-organisms from skin cover is more effective if soap or cleaning tools are added during washing.
The main action of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and raise the level of solubility.
Water itself is not considered an effective means of skin purification, as fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollution, are not properly dissolved in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributed to the process of purification.
Solid soap, due to repeated use, may also contain microbials that may be affected by previous use.
A small amount of research into the per capita coverage of the soiled piece of solid soap suggests that it is unlikely that it will occur, since it is washed away with foam.
The CDC still asserts that “the soft soap with the hand-dosing device is the preferred option for washing hands”.
Anti-bacterial soap is actively promoted in health-care communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended anti-septic or disinfectant means has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, anti-bacterial soap contains common anti-bacterial agents, such as tricole, to which many resistance strains of organisms are persistent.
Thus, even if anti-bacterial resistant strains are not selective against anti-bacterial soap, their efficiency may not be matched by advertisements.
In addition to the surface-activated substance and skin protection, complex compounds may contain acids (acetic, ascorbinic, dairy) as a controller for pH, as well as antimicrobial active gas acid and other excreta (alone faith, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). An integrated analysis by the University of Oregon Public Health School showed that, in terms of preventing diseases and removing microbials from the skin of the hand, simple species of soap are as effective as common anti-bacterial soap containing triclozine.
Hot water of human skin is still not hot enough to kill the germs.
They reproduce much faster at body temperature of 37°C.
However, warm soap water is more effective than cold for the removal of natural fats, containing pollution and bacteria.
Contrary to popular opinion, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial arm pressure.
Hand-to-hand disinfectant (sanitaiser) or hand-to-hand antiseptic agent is a hand-to-hand hygienic tool that contains no water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the use of non-water-containing handhygienic means (also known as disinfectant hands on a alcoholic basis, anti-septic hand disinfectants or sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these devices are made of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, with additional sealants such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) as helium, or moisturizers such as glycerine in liquid or foam form, which makes it easier to use these devices and reduces the effects of the drying of the skin with alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity; disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Disinfectant alcohol kills microbials, including multi-drug-resistance (MRSA and VRE), a TB stick, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, flu and flu) and fungi.
Disinfectant drugs containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of the microbials (the 3.5 reduction log is similar to 35 decibel) on their hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% on their hands 99.999% (the 4-5 reduction logarithm) on their hands 1 minute after use. Hand disinfectants are most effective against the microbials and are less effective against some viruses.
Disinfectant on a alcohol basis is almost inefficient against viruses of the Norovirus (or Norwalk) type, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis; sufficient anti-septic or alcohol-containing means must be used to thoroughly treat and swallow the skin of the hands on both sides.
The face and back surface of both hands, as well as the space between the fingers, are spread over the entire length for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or hel is completely absorbed.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Control recommends that you choose to wash your hands rather than use disinfectants, especially when your hands are heavily polluted.
The growing popularity of such disinfectant means is due to the ease of use and the rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but should not be a substitute for the full washing of hands if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of disinfectant hands on a alcohol basis may cause dry skin if their composition does not contain softening and (or) skin moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glycerine and (or) other softening agents to the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectant containing softening components caused much less irritation and dry skin than soap or antimicrobial cleaning.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact tract syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are almost non-existent.
The lower probability of irritating contact dermatitis has become a factor in the choice of disinfectant in comparison to soap and water.
Despite their efficiency, non-water means do not clean their hands of organic matter, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that disinfectant hands are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens like regular soap and water, as the use of these means still leaves pathogens in their hands.
The efficiency of the disinfectant for non-alcohol hands is highly dependent on the components and composition, and has been considerably lower in history than in alcohol or alcohol.
Most recently, it has been shown that drugs that use benzalconium Chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, as opposed to alcohol which has been shown to be ineffective after repeated use, probably due to progressive by-effects of skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ashes or clay.
Gold or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One of the problems with this method is that if clay or ash is polluted with microorganisms, it may, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant, because it produces a alkaline solution in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends the use of ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommend that hand-washing be used, including the following steps:
Embrace your hands under warm or cold flowing water.
It is the flowing water that is recommended, because standing water can be polluted, but the temperature of the water just doesn't matter.
Wash your hands with lots of soap, including the rear of your hands, and the areas between your fingers and under your fingernails.
Soap removes germs from their skin, and research shows that when using soap (not just one water) people tend to wash their hands more carefully.
Trim your hands for at least 20 seconds.
The trembling helps remove the germs from your skin, and the longer you trim your hands, the more germs are removed.
Stretch your hands carefully under flowing water.
Spraying hands in standing water can cause re-infectation.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel or let them dry themselves.
Wet and wet hands are easily polluted, and most often people ignore areas such as thumb, wrist, between fingers and under their fingernails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended that moisturizing lotion be used to prevent the drying of hands, which may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If current water and soap are not available, there are many different low-cost ways of washing hands: pouring water out of a hanging canister or bottled pumpkin with holes made and (or) using ash, if necessary, as is the case in developing countries. Water saving options such as foot taps and other low-cost options exist in areas with limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries).
A foot-pedal crane is a simple design made up of a canister hanging on a rope and a foot-hand which should be pressed to get water on its hands, and a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand-drying is an integral part of the hands-hygienic process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
Growing research suggests that paper towels are much hygienicer than electric hand dryers installed in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was carried out by the University of Westminster in London and was co-sponsored by the European Paper Servants and Towels Symposia; the study focused on comparing the hygienicity of paper towels, hand dryers with warmer air and more modern air dryers for hands.
It was found that after washing and drying their hands in a dryer with warm air, the total number of microbials on their fingertips was an average increase of 194 per cent and 254 per cent on their palms.
It also turns out that after washing and drying your hands in an air-flowed dryer, the total number of microbials on your fingertips is rising by 42 percent, and on your palms by 15 percent.
After washing and drying with paper towels, the total number of microbials on the fingertips is on average reduced to 76 percent and on the palms to 77 percent. Scientists have also tested the possibility of cross-infecting several visitors in toilet rooms and toilet environments at each type of drying.
A string-air dryer that blows out the air at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 miles/h) is capable of blowing micro-organisms off of his own block and potentially infecting other users of the toilet and toilet within a radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of dryers for warm air hands spread microorganisms within a radius of 0.25 metres from the dryer.
No significant microorganisms were detected using paper towels. In 2005, TUV Produkt und Umwelt carried out a study to evaluate various methods of drying hands.
There are the following changes in the number of microbials depending on the method of drying hands:
There are many different hand dryers and hand dryers are compared to a dryer with paper towels.
Hand-cleaning using disinfectant napkins can be an alternative to travel without soap and water.
The hands disinfectant must contain at least 60% alcohol on a alcohol basis.
The medical method of washing hands became necessary long after the Hungarian doctor Ignatz Semmelweis found it to be highly effective in preventing diseases in stationary conditions in 1846.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget it.
According to one study, the use of such devices does help to reduce infection.
Medical washing of hands lasts at least 15 seconds, and a large amount of soap, water or hel is used to wash and wash each part of the hand.
Hands should be carefully rubbed against each other by clutching their fingers.
If there's dirt under your fingernails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water on their hands, it is important that they be cleaned and cleaned with clean towels.
After drying your hands, close the tap and, if necessary, close and open any door, use a paper towel.
This prevents re-pollution of hands from these surfaces.
The goal of washing hands in health-care institutions is to remove pathogens ("microbials") and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the order of hand washing remains unsuitable in most health institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before they touch patients and thus spread microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other basic procedures could reduce the blood flow from the catheter by 66 per cent and that the World Health Organization had published a leaflet showing the standard washing and hand processing procedure to be used in the health sector.
The draft WHO manual on hand health is also available on its website and open to public discussion.
The review was co-authored by Whitby.
If proof of compliance is required, commercial devices may be used to measure and verify hand-hygienic performance.
The World Health Organization defines "five points" when it comes to washing hands:
After contact with blood or biological fluids,
Before using anti-septic, and
Adding anti-septic chemicals to soap when you wash your hands ("medicine" or "anti-microbial" soap) helps to kill your microbials.
Such anti-bacterial properties may be necessary before performing surgery or in a highly anti-anti-anti-antibiotic-resistant environment. To “clean” hands before surgery, you need a crane that can be turned on and off without touching it; and a little Chloro-hexidine or iodine water should be used to wash your hands, sterile hand-washing towels, a sterile friction brush and another sterile instrument for cleaning under your fingernails.
All ornaments must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and forearms to the elbow usually within 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to rub your hands for too long, like 10 minutes.
During the stripping, water with its forearm must not fall back on the hands.
After the washing, the hands dry with sterile cloth and put on a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use antiseptic for your hands before and after care procedures.
In order to combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20 percent of washing was the most useful and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the hand washing rate was increased by more than 35%.
Compared to the use of anti-bacterial soap, hand washing with normal soap results in more than three times the frequency of microbial infectious diseases transmitted through food, comparing hand washing with alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with anti-bacterial soap, an average of 30 seconds per procedure, showed that hand handling with alcohol-containing solution reduced the biological pollution by 26% compared to anti-bacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hand alcohol in reducing the number of A H1N1 flu viruses and the Clostridium Difphyllium dispute.
Further research is needed on the most effective types of measures in the various health-care institutions.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered a cost-effective and important means of improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of stable water, washing or washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to instill a habit of regularly washing hands.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has a crane to wash its hands, although there are cheap ways to wash its hands in such places.
However, lack of handhygiene can also be caused by persistent habits rather than by lack of soap or water.
The promotion and encouragement of hand-washing with soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
Monitoring and evaluation of results are needed to ensure the effectiveness of such measures.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that, in order to improve the situation of hand-washing in lower-middle income countries, health and epidemic surveillance at the community level is effective, while public marketing campaigns are less effective; one example of advocacy on hand-washing in schools is the "Three Star Approach" approach of the United Nations Children's Fund: it promotes the implementation of simple, cost-effective measures to encourage student hands washing using soap as well as other hygienic requirements.
By meeting minimum standards, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.
Handwashing is one of the possible measures implemented through hands-hygienic information campaigns to reduce the incidence of diseases and child mortality.
The Global Hand washing Day is another example of a behavioural change campaign, and as a result of the 2019-20 Coronauvirus Pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund has promoted the use of an emodie that symbolizes the washing of hands.
Some studies examined the overall efficiency of hand washing in developing countries in comparison with the DALYs indicator (maintained years without disability).
However, one study suggests that encouraging hands washing with soap is a much more economical solution than other health measures.
The importance of washing hands for human health, especially for vulnerable groups such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the middle of the 19th century as two innovators in the field of hand health: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and a "founder of modern care".
At the time, most people still believed that infection was caused by rotten smells called myasms.
In the 1980s, as a result of outbreaks of diseases spreading through the digestive tract and diseases associated with medical care, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Control have become more active in promoting hand health as an important measure to prevent infection.
As a result of the 2009 flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with “good hand-washing techniques” were placed in public toilets as well as in office and airport toilets.
The phrase “wash your hands” means showing their unwillingness to accept responsibility for anything or to be a party to anything.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate “was washing his hands ” when making the decision to crucify Jesus Christ; it was later used more widely in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's "Macbeth" play, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands unwittingly in an attempt to cleanse the imaginary stain that symbolizes an unclean conscience in connection with the crimes she committed and prompted her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people who have remembered or observed any unethical act tend to wash their hands more frequently than others, and their hands were more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who have had the opportunity to wash their hands after what they have seen will participate in any other “cleaning” compensating activities, such as volunteering.
In religion, the washing of hands has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. The symbolic washing of hands with water but without soap is part of the ritual provided for in many faiths, including Baha'i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in judaism, Lavabo in Christians, and Woodhu in Islam. The religion also requires the hygienic washing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Jewishism and Islam require the washing of hands after going to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash your hands before and after every meal.
Control of production factors due to COVID-19
Control of production factors in relation to COVID-19 means employing occupational safety and health techniques to control risk and control the coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper control of workplace risks depends on place and work, based on risk assessment, community severity and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Office for Work and Industrial Health (OSHA) reported that jobs with lower risk have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures are required to control infection, including hand-washing, encouraging workers to stay at home when they are sick, observing the respiratory label, and daily cleaning and disinfecting the working environment.
Middle-risk jobs require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, but are likely to be affected because of the current spread of the disease in society or during international visits.
This may include workers who contact the public, for example in schools, a highly dense working environment and some large retail shops.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include airborne air filters, screen protection and accessible personal protection when contacting a person affected by COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health-care and morgue officers who have contacted a person with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are classified as highly risky, with the risk being raised to very high levels when such officers perform spray-enhancing procedures or collect/ process samples from a person with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such staff include the use of engineering and safety equipment, such as negative pressure venting rooms, and personal protection suitable for the task.
An explosion of COVID-19 may have various effects at the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work because of their own disease, the need to take care of others or the fear of possible infection.
Commercial patterns may vary both in terms of the types of goods for which there is a demand and in terms of how to purchase such goods (e.g. purchases during non-peak periods with delivery or maintenance without leaving the car).
Finally, there may be a breakdown in the delivery of goods from geographical areas affected by COVID-19. Protection may be guided by the Plan for Epidemic Readiness and Response.
The plans address the risks associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors occurring at home and in communities, as well as the risk factors of individual workers, such as old age or chronic diseases.
The plans also identify the controls necessary to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may result from the epidemic.
Plans to prepare for and respond to the epidemic may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the goals of responding to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, protect people at higher risk of serious health problems, maintain business operations and minimize the negative effects on other organizations in their supply chains.
Responses are affected by the severity of diseases in the business community.
The hierarchy of risk control tools is a structure widely used for occupational safety and health to group such tools according to efficiency.
If the risk of COVID-19 cannot be addressed, the most effective means of safety are engineering, then administrative measures and finally personal protection.
Engineering means that employees are excluded from work-related risk areas and do not rely on employee behaviour, which may be the most economical solution.
The administrative measures involve changes in the working policies or procedures that require action by the employee or employee.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help to address some risks.
All types of personal protection equipment must be chosen according to the threat to the employee, be of a size (e.g. respirators), be used continuously and properly, be regularly checked, maintained and replaced as necessary, and be properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid infection.
The U.S. Office of Industrial Health and Safety (OSHA) considers that jobs with the least risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
The basic responses to the epidemic recommended for all jobs include frequent and careful hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, observance of respiratory labels, including closing their mouth with coughing and sneezing, provision of napkins and garbage containers, readiness for remote or replacement work, if necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfecting of the working environment.
The rapid detection and isolation of persons potentially affected is a critical step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Control (CDC) recommend that staff with acute acute respiratory symptoms stay at home until the heat stops, no elevated body temperature, and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-free or other symptoms-free drugs, and that they be allowed to have flexibility on hospital leaves, that employees stay at home to care for a sick family member and that employees be made aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk jobs require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed data or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but are likely to be affected by SARS-COV-2 because of the spread of the disease in society in the area where the business is located, or because of recent visits by such a person to the locations where COVID-19 is distributed.
These include employees who have had contact with the public, for example in schools, high density working environment and some large retail shops. For such groups and groups at higher risk, the engineering and safety tools include the installation of high-quality air filters, increased ventilation, physical barriers, such as transparent plastic protection screens, and the installation of windows for customer services without leaving the car. The administrative measures for such a group and groups at higher risk include the recommendations to sick workers to stay at home, replace personal meetings with virtual means of communication, set off schedule, stop non-critical visits to locations where COVID-19 is distributed, develop emergency communications plans, including a forum for responding to stressful workers, provide relevant training for workers on the risk factors of COVID-19 and protection measures, train workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, ensure the proper use of such tools, provide resources and a work environment that promotes personal health, require regular hand washing, limiting access to the workplaces by customers and by the public, placing of protective devices on the safety of employees, we may require the need for the protection of the hand.
In rare cases, workers from such a risk group may need to wear respirators.
If a person is sick in a plane, measures such as the isolation of a sick person from another person for a distance of six feet, the appointment of a member of a crew to care for the sick person, the provision of a mask to the sick person, or the request to the patient to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin or sneeze are required to ensure the proper safety of workers and other passengers.
Secondary crew members shall wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller or when in contact with physiological fluids or potentially infested surfaces and possibly additional personal protection if the patient has a fever, a regular cough or difficulty breathing.
Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically secure bag and the affected surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. In cases of commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, safety measures include delaying travel in the event of illness, self-isolation and immediate notification of the health centre on board when there is a heat or other symptoms on board.
In the case of schools and childcare institutions, the CDC recommends short-term shutdown for cleaning or disinfecting if the infected person is in the school building, regardless of the incidence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or average rate of infection in the community, social distance policies may be introduced, such as cancelling visits for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events such as exercise or chorus, taking food in cafeterias, increasing the distance between parties, regulating the time of arrival and departure, limiting unnecessary visits, and using the separate location of health-care institutions for children with flu symptoms.
At a high rate of spread in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, long-term school absenteeism may be considered; for law enforcement officials who perform daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered to be low, according to CDC.
Law enforcement officials required to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are encouraged to follow the same instructions as are ordered by the paramedics, including the use of suitable personal protections.
In the event of close contact during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their uniforms and equipment before reuse by domestic cleaning sprays or by protection, observe standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and the disposition of used personal protection devices, as well as the use and washing of clothes.
OSHA considers that some categories of health and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk jobs include medical, support, laboratory and transport staff who contact patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection in their spray-producing procedures or in collecting/handling samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
The procedures followed by the formation of aerosol include sounding, coughing, bronchoscopying, some dental procedures and examinations or collection of samples by invasive methods.
High-risk morgue officers are those who handle the bodies of persons with confirmed illness or suspected of having COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if they do an autopsie, they are placed in a very high-risk category; additional technical and engineering means for such groups include the use of isolated rooms for patients with confirmed illness or suspicion of COVID-19, including procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosol.
In some health institutions and morgues, the use of special, negative-pressure vents can be an effective measure.
Samples should be treated in accordance with the precautions required for biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be distributed to restricted waiting areas, depending on suspected COVID-19 infection. In addition to other personal protection means, OSHA recommends that workers interact at a distance of up to six feet with confirmed patients or suspected of infection with SARS-COV-2, as well as persons conducting procedures accompanied by aerosol formation.
In the U.S., NIOSH approved respirators for a person with a N95 or higher filter need to be used as part of a complex written programme on respirator protection, which specifies the requirements for individual fund-raising and medical examinations.
Other types of respirator can provide more effective protection and comfort to the employee; WHO does not recommend the use of special clothing because COVID-19 is a disease transmitted by the respirator rather than by the use of physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used to screen patients.
WHO recommends that persons collecting samples from the breathing routes of patients with COVID-19 or vectors of this disease without procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosols should wear a surgical mask, protective glasses or face protection screen, a robe and gloves.
In the course of a procedure accompanied by the formation of an aerosol, instead of a surgical mask, a N95 or FFP2 respirator should be worn.
In view of the insufficient availability of personal protection tools around the world, WHO recommends that the need for such protection be minimized by using remote medicine, physical barriers such as so transparent windows, access to a patient affected by COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, use only those personal protections required for a particular purpose, prolonged use of the same respirator without removing, while working with multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and co-ordinating the supply chain of personal protection equipment, and recommendations not to use masks for persons without symptoms.

SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Load relief and preparation for the future
DATE/DETAIN: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
SERVANTS: CC0: No protected rights
This month we live under extraordinary circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interaction of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have had no case law on such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the ability to empathize, cooperation and development of communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We have seen friendly and caring relationships among all our colleagues, as reflected in e-mails, calls and chats, a remarkable confirmation of the fact that fortunately amazing people are working with us.
I speak with great gratitude and pride of you as colleagues.
Last week I was informed of the appreciation of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to contact Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And that's possible thanks to your work, whether it's about making websites work, paying our colleagues, or protecting the safety of communities.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and that's even more important today than ever before.
At such a time, it is important not only what we do, but also how we do it to achieve meaningful results for the world.
Because of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the way in which we work together, starting with the coming week.
Adjusting our working order and timetables
As Robin said earlier, the c-team team met last night to discuss our approach and timetable for the coming days and months.
During our conversations, we considered our ideas on how best to deal with the current situation and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The vast majority of us wanted to ease the strain and support our long-term mission.
If you want to retreat, let it be so.
For all staff, contractors and freelancers:
We expect that it will take about four hours a day or 20 hours a week before further orders are received.
We don't announce weekends: if you can work properly for more hours, that's allowed for our mission.
But the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs are, whether you care for your family, buy food or go to a doctor's, your well-being is our number one priority.
We don't follow your working time.
If you're sick, you shouldn't be working.
This is clear and undeniable, but we mention it.
There is no need to process a hospital sheet or a day off: simply inform your supervisor and help the team re-evaluate the calendar and schedule to reach key areas.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, report to Brian from the T&C Ops unit so that T&C can provide support and attention from management to your situation.)
The full payment of hourly rates will be made.
We have already declared and confirmed our intention to meet our obligation to our contractors and to our staff with an hourly rate of payment.
Each person will be paid according to the normal hourly rates used under normal circumstances.
This includes periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can yield amazing results, especially in times like this.
Again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some jobs are considered to be substantial.
We must always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Foundation teams, among others, perform critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all entities to evaluate current goals and to shift the focus to support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many problems for each and every one of us, and we just focus on the most important projects.
Slowing today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work “two more to catch up” after the end of the pandemic.
You will not need to work overtime in order to meet the unreal deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and will work on setting new goals and timetables, if possible.
What happens to APP (annual plans)?
In order to meet the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timetable for the implementation of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to offer an extension of time for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for the preparation of the budget, which will enable staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and caring for loved ones, while all who need or want to work will be provided with a shortened schedule for the next few weeks.
This extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and strains across the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, inform representatives and teams of the relevant information on the next steps immediately after confirmation.
Thank the APP team for taking the lead in this work.
Office condition, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco might be affected by the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to many precautions, we hired an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used anti-virus medical solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and elevator halls, through which access to our floor is possible.
The building applies its own rules of care, using products that provide security for its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in D.C. (DC) is on the web of WeWork, which has shared with us and all the staff in DC its COVID-19 rules.
Last week, our office in D.C. moved completely to remote work in accordance with instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the issue of renting an apartment in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but can be deferred.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues, working remotely, are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider the possibility of splitting them into a course of several days.
Please specify the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and send the material in advance.
By default, use video communications to improve interaction and communication using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For ease of reference, select a contact person who will follow up questions on the chat and monitor the list of speakers as well as the person responsible for the notes (or joint notes).
If necessary, contact the Technical Support Service via e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement when you buy appetizers.
Connect to the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying the Ergonomics Manuals, which are available in web-based formats, in order to contribute to the efficiency of distributed work across the organization.
Last week we asked all community grantees to cancel the massive activities financed by Wikimedia, such as "editathons," until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such terminations and other limitations may lead to the impossibility of carrying out agreed grant activities and that no one will be fined for having to delay or modify such goals.
In the coming week, we will conduct follow-up activities with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and topical meetings of the community.
The global mood in the global community is not only a disappointment about interrupting work, but also a feeling of relief with understanding and the ability to focus on our own communities, Wikimedia and more.
In terms of prospects, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide space for the community to monitor effects and communication.
We remain in contact on matters related to COVID-19
We'll send an invitation to your calendar to a special staff meeting next Thursday, 2:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time we'll take the opportunity to share more relevant information, answer your questions and spend some time with each other.
We're together in this situation and we're ready to help anything we can.
You can still get information from this email, while other important information on COVID-19 is from Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If there are questions about trips, events, key workflows, lighting problems or other assistance, contact CRT.
We are ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
If privacy problems occur, contact Brian June, director of HR International Global Operations, by email.
No such change should be seen as a renunciation of our work and our responsibilities.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible ongoing need for a radically new adjustment of our work and our responsibilities.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to enable us to continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the necessary service.
Our planned work will wait until the right time.
It is now time to support each other and create space for the important work to be done in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
For that to happen, we will need the help of each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families and to work as effectively as possible once such a need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katerine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S) and the rest of the Team's Team Leadship Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jamie V, Janen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotenzine-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, renal and intestines.
ACE2 prevents the activity of angiotenzine-transverse enzyme (ACE) by reducing the content of angiotenzine II and increasing Ang (1-7). It makes it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also provides a point of entry to cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotenzine-transforming enzyme 2 is a sine-containing metal ferment on the surface of endotile and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-end peptidetic domain of M2 and the C-end transport domain of the renal amino acid collector.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, and its enzyme-active domain affects the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The ACE2 extracellular domain is detached from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as the sheddaza, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually released with pee.
ACE2 is present in most bodies: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most of the pulmonary pulmonary cells of type II, the enthrocytes of thin intestines, the arterial and venous endothelic cells and the smooth muscle cells of most organs.
The biosynthesis of the ACE2 IRNA is also found in the cortex of the brain, the stratum, the hypothalamus and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE splits the hormone angiotensin I into a vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, retools the carboxylic end acid of henylian from angiotenzine II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into a vasodiodynamic angiotenzine (1-7). (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also split a number of other peptids, including [des-Arg9] - bradikinine, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A and greline.
ACE2 also controls the membrane transport of neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main input point for some coronaviruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-COV (SARS); and SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, connecting S1 proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosome inside the cells.
This login process also requires the simulation of a S protein with a serial protein of the TMPRSS2 medium, which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic tool, and has led some to think that decreasing levels of ACE2 in cells can help combat infection.
However, many professional communities and regulatory bodies recommend that standard AFP and BRA inhibitors be continued.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, "the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group".
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients receiving APF inhibitors, who have been at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF ingibitors was also associated with a decrease in mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than for patients with general risk of pneumonia.
It is assumed that recombinant human ACE2 (rhaCE2) is an innovation in therapy for acute pulmonary damage and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynomics and the saturation of the pulmonary saturation of pigs with acute acute inhalation syndrome caused by lipopolysicharides.
The half-life rhaCE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the start date is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of 24 hours.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be a promising tool for people with a classical inguitybiter of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which a circulation angiotense II is raised. The introduced rhaCE2 has been evaluated in the process of treating acute respirator distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile phones designed to assist in the epidemiological investigation of the 2019-20 Coronauvirus Pandemic, i.e. in the detection of persons (contacts) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions many applications have been developed or offered, officially supported by the authorities.
Several contacts tracking applications have been developed.
This led to a discussion on privacy issues, especially with respect to systems based on tracking the geographical location of applications users.
The softer options in this respect include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate the Bluetooth support function directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, together with Alipaya, launched an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people living with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, and in Singapore it is used by an application called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia has launched a "StopKorona" application, working on Bluetooth, which helps track contact with potentially infected people and provides operational communication with health services.
The application was developed together by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was expected to be registered with Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government announced that the contact tracking application was in the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks; similar applications are scheduled to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering using applications based on the Singapore TraceTagether application and the BlueTrace protocol, and Russia is intending to use an application with a geozonation function to ensure that patients with COVID-19 who live in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor in security, University of Cambridge, describes a number of potential practical problems that may arise with application-based systems, including false reactions and potential inefficiencies if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In view of concerns about the distribution of confusing or malware "coronavirus" applications, Apple restricted the list of types of organizations that might offer their Coronavirus applications to App Store by including only " official" or other reliable organizations in the list.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
The privacy campaign raised concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance of the population through Coronavirus applications; in particular, the question was raised whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the Coronauvirus Pandemic would be dismantled when the threat would disappear.
AI and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
The organizations announced eight conditions for public projects:
Monitoring should be “legitimate, necessary and proportional”;
The extension of monitoring and observation should be accompanied by time-limits;
Data use should be limited to the purpose of controlling the distribution of COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity should be protected and evidence of such security provided;
Digital surveillance should prevent cases of increased discrimination and exclusion;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be defined at the level of law;
Protection against abuse should be guaranteed, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuses;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple offer their joint plan to address the problem of ongoing monitoring, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as it is no longer necessary.
In some countries, network location tracking is used instead of applications, which prevents the application from being loaded and the possibility of avoiding traceability.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions that have access to location reference data also have great potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of systems have been developed with privacy which use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system was used to track contacts without using applications as a basis.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including traceability of mobile devices and transactions with cards, and then merged them to create notification in the form of text messages sent to potentially infected persons.
The Government had not only used this information to alert citizens to potential contact with infected persons, but had also made information on the location available to the public, which had been made possible by significant changes in the legislation on the protection of information that had been introduced following the MERS explosion in the country.
This information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites; countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized and confidential systems.
As at 6 April 2020, details had not yet been made public.
As of April 7, 2020, more than ten expert groups were working on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register users approaching other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a co-ordinating effort that includes both centralized and delimited approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include a decentralised process with privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Context EventNumbers, CEN), privacy protocols, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT), etc.
These protocols are responsible for making sure that identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all comparisons are made on it.
The Privacy Group, MlT Media Lab, develops SafePaths, a platform to maintain privacy in the collection and use of location or route data to track the distribution of COVID-19.
This platform is based on research published in March 2020 by Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company that develops technology for privacy, which was also originally founded by MlT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware to enable users to exchange confidential data on location and health with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of these data.
On 5 April 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols founded a global TCN coalition, which aims to reduce the fragmentation and global compatibility of the tracking and warning applications, which is a key factor in their wide distribution.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative which they claimed would ensure privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography to maintain privacy.
They also published the technical characteristics of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be rolled out in three steps:
deployment of tools to enable governments to create official applications to track the movement of people affected by the coronavirus, but to protect data privacy
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple, they plan to solve problems with constant observation, first inventing the system by updating the operating system and then removing it in the same way after the threat has disappeared.
Reconfiguration of a drug (also known as reprofiling, redirecting, changing tasks or therapeutic redirecting of drugs) is the reprofiling of an approved drug to treat a disease or medical condition different from that originally provided for in the design.
This is one of the research areas that is currently being used to develop safe and effective methods of treating COVID-19.
Other research areas include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and reconvalescence plasma transfusion. SARS-COV-2 contains about 66 proteins that can be affected by drugs, each of which has several ligand binding areas.
Analysis of these sequestration sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective anti-virus anti-protein drug COVID-19.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are popo-like proteasy, RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, helicosis, S protein, and ADF-ribophosphasis.
Hussain AA and the co-authors in their doclinical study examined several candidate compounds which were then optimised and analyzed their similarity with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-COV-2, which will be recommended for clinical research.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug which is also used to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that Chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs examined during the Solidarity trial.
The governor of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that testing of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine would take place in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and phosphate of Chloroquine in accordance with the emergency use authorization (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the FDA trial process and is allowed under EUA only as an experimental emergency treatment for patients who are hospitalized but are unable to receive treatment under the hospital trial schemes.
The CDC stated that “the use, dosing or duration of the use of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when there's no other way out.
The Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of Chloroquine, combined with zinc and Vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is being carried out at Duke University and Oxford University.
The University of New York Medical School in Langon is studying the safety and effectiveness of the prevention of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese trials in Uhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravirus is “mutually effective.”
In the 35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug, the negative result was averaged 4 days later, while in the 45 patients who did not take the drug the duration of the disease was 11 days.
In Uhan, a study was carried out to monitor 240 pneumonia patients, one half of whom received a favipiravirus and the other half received a Umithenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Authority had reminded the public that the results of the drug's efficiency were scarce and should not be considered final.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase a drug in Japan to supplement its stocks and that it would use military resources to transport it to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post newspaper, Sindzo Abe informed the Trump administration about the possibility of buying a drug; the drug may be less effective in neglected cases.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or for patients who attempt to become pregnant.
One study on the combination of anti-virus drugs called "lopinavirus" and "ritonavirus" (Calette) concluded that "no effective use of drugs has been detected".
The drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by tying it to the protesis.
A group of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a connection that will connect to the protesis of SARS-COV-2. In the scientific community, the reprofiling of drugs that have been developed specifically for the treatment of HIV and AIDS is critical.
WHO has included a combination of lopinavirus and rytonavirus in the international Solidarity test.
The Remdesiver was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat the Ebola virus and the Marburg virus infection. Subsequently, Gilead Sciences found that the Remdesivere has anti-virus activity in vitro with regard to multiple phylo-, pneumo-, paramix- and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with anti-virus treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early pre-study studies show that the remdesire may have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and several trials are currently under way, including two by University clinics in Cleveland; one by moderately ill patients; and the other by patients with more severe forms.
There are currently three hospital trials for the infusion of vitamin C for people hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, the state of New York began testing azitromycin antibiotic.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a medical study of Alvesco (cyclonesonide) Taijin, an inhalation corticosteroid for the treatment of asthma, for use in the treatment of pre-symptomic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II testing, a form of angiotenzine-transforming enzyme 2, is carried out with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria who are hospitalized with severe diseases to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute for Cardiovascular Sickness, Canada, are currently examining the role of colchicin in reducing inflammation and pulmonary symptoms in patients with low levels of COVID-19.
For a study called COLCOronA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 were invited with light symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breast-feeding and without effective means of birth control are not allowed to take part in this study.
In Italy, several coagulants are being tested.
Low molecular heparin is commonly used to treat patients, which has prompted the Italian Medicines Authority to publish recommendations for the use of this drug.
On 14 April, a multicentury study with 300 patients was announced in Italy on the use of sodium enoxparin in preventative and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-COV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on reprofiling approved anti-virus drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese recommendations.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that were considered potentially suitable for use in the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 Receptor): approved in China.
Also in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 Vaccine is a hypothetical anti-coronauvirus (COVID-19) vaccine.
Despite the fact that no vaccine has been tested, numerous attempts to develop it continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization ( WHO) stated that it did not expect the ARS-COV-2 virus to be available before 18 months.
In April, five Vaccine candidates were undergoing phase I security studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major explosion of the disease spread around the world, resulting in significant investments in the development and research of the vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the EPI initiative for the development of vaccines are to provide the required speed, production capacity, scale deployment and global access.
In April, EPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were in the process of being explored and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in the phase I security study are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and PhD candidate: Moderna, RNS-1273)
viral vector (Phase I developer and PhD for Vaccine: CanSino Biologys, Adenomivirus vector type 5)
According to EPI researchers in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are being used in approved active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 additional candidate vaccines have been declared, but there is little public information available (presumably in the planning or development stage).
Phases I to II carry out pre-tests for safety and immunogeneity, usually rendominated, placebo-controlled and at several sites, while simultaneously defining more precise and effective doses.
Phase III of the tests usually includes more participants, including a control group; at this stage the drugs are tested for disease prevention efficiency while simultaneously monitoring side effects at the best dosages.
Of the 79 highly developed (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on a human being (already in the doclinical stage).
On January 24, 2020, University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular clamped vaccine that genetically modified viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.

On February 27, 2020, Generex, Nu Generex Immuno-Oncology, announced that she was launching a project to develop an Ii-Key Peptide Vaccine against COVID-19.
Their goal was to develop a candidate drug for a vaccine that could be tested on people in 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its projects for the development of a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States military medical research and maintenance team, Fort Detrick, and the military research institute, Walter Reed, Silver Spring, located in the western part of Maryland, announced that they were developing their own vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that she had entered into a partnership with Novax Inc.
For the development and production of a vaccine.
The partners have also announced plans to carry out stage I doclinical testing and trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients and that it would take at least one and a half or two years to develop a vaccine, even in an accelerated mode.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec, reported that, with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research, they had created a particle like the coronavirus.
A potential vaccine is being researched and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "greater money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German government protested against.
On March 17, 2020, the United States Pfeizer Pharmaceutical Company announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an IRN-based vaccine.
BNT162 is a candidate for an IRN-based vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing doclinical testing and the trial will start in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that it would receive the results of the doclinical tests in April 2020, and that their final product for the vaccine might start testing people in the fall.
On March 19, 2020, the Epidemic Readiness Innovation (CEPI), France, announced that US$ 4.9 million would be invested in the COVID-19 Vaccine Development Consortia with the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience, Vienna, and the University of Pittsburgh.
Other investment partners in the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford and University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Imperial College researchers, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-implementing RNA-vaccine from COVID-19.
The PhD was developed within 14 days of the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced the allocation of 275 million Canadian dollars to finance 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of multiple vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
About the same time, the Canadian government announced a special allocation of US$ 192 million for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as plans to create a national “vaccine bank” that would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus explosion.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported on the testing of PittCoVacc, a possible anti-COVID-19 vaccine on mice, saying that "MONA introduced SARS-COV-2 S1, causing strong responses to anti-gen-specific antibodies [in mice], which appeared two weeks after immunisation."
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Canadian Pharmaceutical School announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine that might be produced in the form of spray.
With the use of germs, DNA will reproduce within human microbials and produce harmless viral-like particles that can induce the immune system to develop antibodies against the SARS-COV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities combined IBM supercomputer resources with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologic effects, also referred to as non-specific effects.
This means that they can have other advantages than preventative properties.
Another case study carried out in Australia covered 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies of animal models of COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgent mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for measures to contain infection with biosafety 3 in the treatment of living viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines available to treat SARS that are safe and effective for people.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world, and there is also no verified vaccine against MERS.
When MERS began to spread, it was believed that the SARS study which had been conducted at the time could be the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-COV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one ( DNA-based) MERS, which had passed phase I of the human trial, and three more, all of which were virus vector-based and were in the process of being developed, two were adenovirus (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
The social media spread a theory of conspiration, arguing that the COVID-19 virus is not new at all, and that there is already a cure for it.
A social media publication quoted some patients who claimed to have patents on genetic sequences of other strains of coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus, as well as the vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19) which is an infectious disease caused by acute coronavirus syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties.
Other symptoms may include feelings of fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between the first symptom and the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease is relapsing into viral pneumonia and polyorganic insufficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, and over 153,000 people had died of the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus is spread mostly through close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops released into the air by coughing, sneezing or conversation.
While these drops are formed by exhalation, they usually pose a threat by falling to the ground or on the surface, but are not transported through the air at long distances.
People are also affected by polluted surfaces and then by their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days after the symptoms appear, although it may be possible both before the symptoms occur and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymerase chain reaction with real-time inverse transcryption (RT-PRR) on a sample taken as a swab.
The use of medical masks is recommended to patients suspected of being ill and to those caring for them.
The recommendations on the use of medical masks vary among the population: some agencies recommend that they not be used at all, some recommend their use and others require it.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
Local spread has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms or flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and breath.
Extreme symptoms include breathing difficulties, constant pain or feelings of compression in the chest, confusion of consciousness, difficulty in awakening, facial or lip blueness; if the symptoms are shown, medical attention should be sought immediately.
Sneaking, sneezing, or throat pain can be a more acute symptom of upper breath tract disease.
Also, in different percentages, there are gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, puke, and diarree.
Some cases reported in China were originally only reflected by feelings of chest depression and increased heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress in pneumonia, polyorganic failure, and eventually death.
It's called the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
97.5 per cent of people experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection; according to available data, not all of them show symptoms.
The role of such unsympathetic bearers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary data suggest that they can contribute to the spread of infection.
The rate of infection is currently unknown and is only being studied, while the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Control (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations related to the virus were symptomless.
The National Health Commission of China had begun to include unsymptomed cases in its daily report since 1 April; of the 166 cases reported on that date, 130 (78%) had declined to be symptomless at the time of testing.
Both wet and saliva can have a greater concentration of the virus.
In a loud speech, more drops are released into the air than in a normal volume speech.
A study in Singapore found that the drops can spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) in open cough.
The virus is generally not airborne, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transfer of particles of the virus by bioerosol is still possible, and the testing of the air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside people's rooms has shown the presence of a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (CLR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and hence to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus may spread through fecals, but the risk is considered to be low; the virus is most contagious when symptoms occur; the spread of the virus may occur before symptoms occur, but the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that it is not clear how easily the virus spreads yet that one patient usually infects two or three other people; the virus can survive on the surface from hours to days.
In particular, it was found that on the cardboard surface the virus could live for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99% of the copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These values, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and washing, if properly used, have a rather useful effect in controlling infection: soap destroys the fat layer of the virus, deactivates it, and can also remove it from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconichloride and Gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are less effective against the virus; in a study carried out in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after hospitalization.
For five out of six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, while the sixth patient found the highest level of the virus in the blood on the second day of testing.
The severe acute coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new acute coronavirus syndrome that was first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All signs of the new SARS-COV-2 virus are also found in naturally related coronaviruses.
While outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which opens up its protective shell.
The lungs are the organ most affected by COVID-19 because the virus penetrates the host cells through angiotenzine-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II alveolar light cells.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates the owner's cell using a typical surface glycoprothein, the "spike" (peplomeer).
12% of the infected people in Uhan hospital have been diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in severe cases.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the system inflammatory response and the effects of the immune system observed during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be due to the presence of ACE2 recipes in the heart.
ACE2 recipes are present in large numbers in the heart because they participate in the work of this body.
A high rate of thormbolic (31%) and veneous thromboembolic (25%) was observed in patients in the OTC with COVID-19 and may indicate bad predictions. The autotopics of patients killed by COVID-19 showed that there were diffuse alveolar injuries (DAD) and lymphocytically inflammable infiltrations in their lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropic effect on ACE2-expressing epithelial tract cells, patients with heavy COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflamation.
In particular, it was found that GM-XF T cell pathogens correlate with the incendiary monocytes emitting IL-6 and heavy lung pathology for patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocitarian infiltrates were also found during the postmortem.
WHO has also published several testing protocols for this disease.
A real-time polymeric chain reaction (RT-PRR) is a standard testing method.
Tests are usually carried out on respirator samples obtained with a swab, but may also be carried out with a swab from the nose or wet swab.
The results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results are not of direct importance.
Chinese scientists have been able to extract a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that researchers in laboratories around the world can independently develop polymeraceous chain reaction (CPR) tests to detect the presence of this virus.
As at 4 April 2020, anti-body tests that could detect infection at present, as well as possible past infection, were under development but were not yet widespread.
Chinese experience with the results of these tests has shown that their accuracy is only 60-70%.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Department of Food and Medicines Quality Control (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, allowing it to be used at the end of this month.
Two-sided multi-pronged sub-pletral compaction tricks of the type of "match glass" with peripheral, asymmetrical and a posterior distribution are common symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Sub-plural dominantity, symptom of a rocky bridge (extensive crowding of a variable alveolar-filled partition) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic injuries and pathophysics of COVID-19.
Main results of the pathology study carried out during the post-mortem:
Macroscopie: Pluorite, pericarditis, compaction and lung swelling
You can observe four types of viral pneumonia:
light pneumonia: lung swelling, hyperplasia of pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyteric infiltration, and multi-nucleous giant cells
severe pneumonia: Difficulty alveolar damage (DAD) with fusion alveolar excude.
The DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS) and heavy hypoxemia.
Life-saving pneumonia: organization of excisions in alveolar fields and pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse inward cedar clotting (DVC syndrome); whiteeritroblastic reaction
Preventative measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowds, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing the rules of breathing, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends that the mouth and nose of a napkin be covered with a cough or sneeze, or, in the absence of a napkin, that the mouth and nose be covered with the inside of the ulna.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended that a quality hand-hygienic procedure be carried out.
The CDC recommends that tissue masks be used in public places, in particular to limit the transmission of infection to persons with unsymptomed diseases; social distance strategies are designed to reduce the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have closed schools and businesses, restricted the movement of citizens and cancelled large public events.
Distance recommendations also mean that people must be at least six feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no drugs with confirmed efficiency against COVID-19. Since the end of the development of the vaccine is expected no later than 2021, most of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 are to reduce the peak of the epidemic known as the "to-plateau" epidemic.
CDC also recommends that hands with soap and water be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after a toilet visit or severe hand pollution, as well as before food and after shrivelling, coughing or sneezing.
CDC also recommends the use of a disinfectant (alcohol content at least 60%) for hand processing, but only when soap and water are not available; WHO provides two recipes for local production to regions where such disinfectants are not sold.
These combinations use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove the biological dispute in alcohol and is not a suitable tool for antiseptic hand processing.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
The patients are shown support therapy, which may include infuse therapy, Oxygen support, and other affected vital organs.
CDC recommends that those suspected of having virus infection wear a normal medical mask.
Extracorporal membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of breathing failure, but its advantages are still being studied.
In order to enhance immunity, personal health, healthy living and diet are recommended.
Supportive methods of therapy can be shown to patients with slight symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the U.S., IBCC, the IBC, and IBC, have been synthesized by doctors and pulmonologists.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
To treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health professionals recommend that a choice be made in favour of paracetamol (acetaminophene) in comparison to ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health-care institutions, when carrying out procedures that may result in an airborne release, such as intubation or hand-drying.
The CDC recommends that health workers who care for people with COVID-19 should be placed in an air cell (AIIR) as an additional measure, in addition to standard contact and air precautions. The CDC has published recommendations on the use of personal protection devices (POPs) during the Pandemic.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves; of the above, it is preferred to use respirators rather than medical masks.
The N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with the emergency application authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air such as dust, but, when used not according to instructions, protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends that protective face screens be used or, at least, that masks be made independently in the home.
In most cases, the flow of COVID-19 is not heavy enough to require artificial lung venting or an alternative, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where it is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with inhalation problems associated with COVID-19 is currently under active study, with some evidence that intubation can be prevented by using an intubated nose-acid cable with intense airflow or a two-level positive pressure in the airway.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods are as effective for patients in critical condition as HlV.
Some doctors choose to invasive mechanically ventilate their lungs, if available, because this method significantly restricts the distribution of particles in the air compared to the high air flow nose. The risk of severe diseases for older persons (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
In many developed countries, hospital beds per capita are scarce and health systems resources are too limited to cope with a sharp increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 infection that require hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive care, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for their lungs and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30 percent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 eventually get into ICU.
The function of artificial lung venting becomes more difficult, as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developing with COVID-19 and Oxygenation cause more and more problems.
PVDs with inhalation pressure and PVCs are required to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to provide a minimum of damage by ventilating which may result in pneumothorax.
On earlier fan models, high PVCs may not be available.
Research on potential treatment methods began in January 2020 and several anti-virus drugs are currently in the process of being tested.
The most promising is the Remdesire.
The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the last stages of testing.
Anti-virus drugs can be tested for patients with severe diseases.
Recommended by WHO, volunteers are involved in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatment methods. The FDA has granted temporary permission to use reconvalescent plasma as a experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is at risk of serious or immediate danger.
It has not been subjected to any clinical research which should be carried out to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application designed to combat an outbreak of disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number to login.
The application can detect a close contact using observation data and hence determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is found, the application not only recommends self-insulation but also sends notification to local health authorities; large data analysis collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to trace data from mobile phones of people suspected of being affected by the coronavirus.
Quarantine and protection measures have been taken for persons who may contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, the German government and the Robert Koch Institute provided aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology has been introduced to detect quarantine infractions.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said that cellular network operators reported that “40% of people are still moving around the Territory.
The German government conducted a 48-hour holiday programming marathon, in which more than 42,000 participants participated.
The Estonian President, Kersti Calulide, also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People can experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: "Enhanced social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming people's mental health and well-being."
Infectious diseases can occur lightly with slight or missing symptoms similar to other common upper tract diseases, such as common cold.
A patient with a lighter form of disease generally heals within two weeks, while a patient with heavy or critical forms may need between three and six weeks to be treated.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of having a severe form of COVID-19 based on data on other such viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although data on COVID-19 are not available; some people may be affected by COVID-19 and cause pneumonia as a complication.
For those with the most severe conditions of the disease, COVID-19 can rapidly progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing breathing failure, septic shock or polyorganic failure.
Compounds of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal clotting, and heart, renal and liver problems.
Anomalies of thorax education, especially the increase in protrombin time, were described in 6% of patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, while 4% of this group experienced a renal disorder.
About 20–30% of patients with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were in hospital.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
Early studies indicate that the average time between the initial symptoms and the day of death was 14 days, with a range of six to 41 days.
According to a study carried out by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8 per cent and for women 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological studies of post-mortem lung samples indicate a diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromixoids in both lungs.
There were viral cytopathic changes in the pneumocytes.
The look of the lung was like a acute respirator-distress syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8 per cent of cases of death registered by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were caused by increased troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems; access to health resources and the social and economic situation in the region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality vary according to state due to such regional differences as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Inadequate calculation of cases in an easy form may result in an overestimation of the mortality rate.
However, the fact that death occurs as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is undervalued.
For smokers, the severe symptoms of COVID-19 were generally 1.4 times more frequently, with about 2.4 times more people in need of intensive care or dying than non-smokers, and concerns were raised about the long-term effects of the disease.
The administration of a hospital in Hong Kong found that some patients who had recovered from the disease had reduced their lungs by between 20 and 30 percent, and their scanning showed damage.
After recovery, it can also lead to the after-intensive therapy syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients who had recovered from the virus were immune to it.
Based on the flow of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but cases have also been reported where, after recovery from COVID-19, the coronavirus tests were still positive.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been an exacerbation of the prolonged period of the disease rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural, animal and infectious.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the infection was almost entirely caused by human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet calls 1 December 2019 the earliest date of the first case.
According to official data published by WHO, the date is December 8, 2019.
There are usually several methods used to measure mortality.
All figures vary according to region and time, and are also affected by levels of testing, quality of health systems, treatment schemes, time since the outbreak and population parameters such as age, gender and general health status.
In late 2019, WHO assigned emergency code for ICD-10: U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 and U07.2 for deaths due to clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-COV-2 infection. The ratio of deaths to infection is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a certain period of time.
According to statistics from the University of Johns Hopkins, as of 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and cases of infection is 6.9 per cent (153,822/2, 240,191).
This figure varies from region to region; some other methods include the definition of the disease mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the disease, as well as the definition of the vector mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the figures of a certain segment of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced by all patients who have been affected, the presence of such antibodies suggests how many people have been infected.
In the epicentre of the explosion in Italy, Castillon d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 persons (1.7 percent) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during the celebration of carnival among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overstretched.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population can have antibodies based on blood supply.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.
According to studies carried out in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher for men.
The greatest risk group is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women has narrowed only since they were 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this difference are unknown, but may lie in genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower incidence of female smoking, associated with men's diseases (e.g. hypertension in men at younger ages than women) can cause higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of deaths from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government did not maintain gender statistics for COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and EPRI have different gender statistics.
Most health-care workers, especially nurses, are women and therefore have a better chance of infection.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
The head of WHO, Mr. Tetros Adanom Guebreis, explained: "CO" means "corona", "VI" means "virus," "D" means "disease" and "19" means the year the explosion first occurred: December 31, 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a particular geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of humans, as required by international recommendations for naming to prevent stigmatizing. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the severe acute coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO uses the terms "COVID-19" and "COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus themselves are commonly called the Coronavirus.
During the initial explosion in Uhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the "coronavirus" and the "ahanc coronavirus".
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical sites in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms 2019-nCov and 2019-nCov as temporary names for the virus and disease.
On February 11, 2020, the official names "COVID-19" and "SARS-COV-2" were published.
Because of the limitations on the volume of standard supply chains, some digital service providers print medical materials such as nose swabs and details of SVL devices.
In one such case, the Italian hospital was in urgent need of a vent valve and the vendor was unable to deliver it as soon as possible, while one of the local factories was re-profiled and was able to print the required 100 valves per night.
Following the first explosion of COVID-19, various plot theory, misinformation and fake information about the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the virus began to spread rapidly on the Internet.
It's possible that people can infect other animals with virus.
Research did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
So far, there is no approved virus or drug cure for it.
Various international studies of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs are currently being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial (SOLIDARITY Test) programme, which aims to evaluate the treatment effects of the four existing compounds considered to be most effective to date.
There is not yet a ready-made vaccine, but various organizations are actively developing candidate drugs for the vaccine.
Both SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 penetrate human cells using the ACE2 recipe, so scientific research uses the results of previous research on SARS-COV.
There are three strategies for immunisation.
First, researchers are trying to create an integral virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to trigger a rapid human immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a sub-unitary vaccine, aims at creating a vaccine that increases the vulnerability of the immune system to certain sub-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-COV-2, such research aims at destroying a spike-like squirrel that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme.
The third strategy is the development of nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA or RNA-vaccines, a new method of creating a vaccine).
The experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first testing of the vaccine began in Seattle on four volunteers.
Vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease, and the anti-telerosoidal increase has been listed as a potential problem in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is questionable.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active trials have been carried out.
The drugs approved for malaria treatment were evaluated during seven tests, four of which were for hydroxychloroquine or Chloroquine.
The reprofiling of anti-virus drugs is the bulk of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine phase III studies had been carried out in several countries on remdesivirus.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review was carried out of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. For the same purpose, several other existing anti-virus drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are also being considered, including remdesivere, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Rytonavir, and Lopinavir/Rytonavir, combined with beta interferon.
As of March 2020, there are tentative data on the efficiency of the use of remdecivirus.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients who have received the Remdesire as an exception.
Phase III of the trials is already under way in the United States, China and Italy. The use of Chloroquine, previously used for malaria treatment, was examined in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of Chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dosage of one gram, but notes that doubling this dosage is very dangerous and can lead to fatal effects.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued a permit for the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. Chinese instructions also specify interferon, ribavirin or umithenovir as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggests that high levels of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for a detailed study in vivo by demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low levels. Studies showed that in order to infiltrate SARS-CoV-2 by interacting with the ACE2 recipe, it is necessary to use a transmembrane protein series 2 (TMPRSS2).
Research on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin has serious limitations which prevent the health community from using these treatments without more detailed study; Oceltamivirus does not inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro and its role in treating COVID-19 is not clear.
Hypercytokinemia may occur as a complication at late stages of a heavy form of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytenemy properties; as a result of a small study carried out by the National Health Commission of China, tocilismumab has been included in the Coronauvirus treatment recommendations.
This drug has reached stage 2 of a non-randomised test which is being carried out at the national level in Italy, after positive results have been obtained from patients with severe illnesses.
Combined with blood serum testing on ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counter factors that are believed to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved antagonist for the interlequine 6 recipe based on retrospective case studies to treat the release of steroid refractory cytokine due to another cause, the CAR T-cell therapy.
Currently, there is no retraced and controlled evidence that tocilismumab is an effective remedy for Cytokin release syndrome.
The transfer of cleaned and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is now seen as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation.
The strategy was tested in the treatment of patients from SARS, but the results were unconvincing.
Neutralizing the virus is the expected effect that passive antibodies therapy can provide protection against SARS-COV-2.
However, it is possible to use other mechanisms such as anti-body-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or fagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibodies therapy, such as those made with monoclonial antibodies, are in the process of being developed.
The use of reconvalescent blood serum, which consists of a liquid part of the blood of healed patients and contains antibodies against the virus, may be increased.

Lee Wenliang, a doctor at Uhan Central, who later became infected and died of COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
